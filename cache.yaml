- Dear Melody,
- Dear Rory,
- ! '''Now, what''s this supposed to be?'''
- ! '''Help me please,'' the voice called to him.'
- He took the box, lifting it high and inspecting every aspect of it.
- ! '''Come on,'' the Doctor said, urging the boy to move.'
- There it was.
- ! '''Ah,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''What''s in the box?!'''
- ! '''Do they need their memories?'''
- Lifting his head from the dirt, the Doctor felt the heat burning his back against
  the orange felt ground.
- Fifty of them, all staring up at him.
- They landed just as harshly as they had set off, and the Doctor lead Clara out,
  helping Harper of the floor and out the door.
- ! '''Home?'''
- Clara's foot sounded like the ticking of a clock upon the glass-like floor.
- The Doctor flew back to the console, hitting the side and rushing his fingers across
  the white surface until Clara heard a loud clunk.
- The TARDIS landed sharply, making a hollow thud as it materialised inside another
  TARDIS.
- ! '''What''s in the box?!'''
- ! '''Any of them?'''
- ! '''There''s no way this is going to work,'' Lussi said, her hands shaking over
  a button.'
- ! '''So,'' Jaymse said as they made their way to the front curtain.'
- Jaymse swallowed a lump in his throat.
- Jaymse was up.
- Jaymse woke up again.
- I'd wandered around for years.

- ! '"So, where do you want to start?"'
- All it can do is delay it for a while."
- R&R
- She was so deep in her own thoughts that she didn't even notice the concerned looks
  that Rose and her grandfather exchanged.
- He was half-frozen, his eyelashes iced, his fingers blue, his trainers blocks of
  ice on his feet, but he had a warm golden light guiding him unerringly towards the
  one place in all the universes that he most wanted to be; next to Rose.
- ! '"As your majesty commands," Jake laughed.'
- None of them was feeling very sanguine about their survival chances just then.
- Things were looking up.
- How very kind madness had been and how damned inconvenient that it had chosen to
  settle on him now.
- There was so much to do to heal this one that she almost didn't know where to start.
- he shouted.
- Eventually, it's going to break."
- He held the Doctor as he wept and finally felt like he was doing something right.
- ! '"Pleased to meet you, Tomoko-6," he told her and reached out to shake her hand.'
- Somehow, he always managed to forget about the Arkytior.
- ! '"As soon as I have one, you''ll be the first to know," he told her.'
- ! '"Thank you," she said, and meant it.'
- That's why he reconfigured the Lens, my dear, to call that lightning to heel, in
  Adie," the Doctor explained.
- ! '"Done."'
- he protested as Susan dragged him away.
- ! '"Yeah, me too."'
- In their place, he'd have wanted to kill him too.
- Dad
- ! '- Oswin'
- He had to hope so.
- Excellent.
- Perhaps there was more to it.
- He slid the stethoscope to the boy's right...
- The lights went out.
- he demanded.
- Save their memories.'
- With it's own TARDIS.
- This was going to have to be good.
- Back in the game.

- ! '''That''s not a cave,'' Clara noticed.'
- A new breed of Time Lords.'
- ! '''I''m fine.'''
- After all, you are my mother.'
- Save their memories.'
- ! '''I''ve missed you too.'''
- Lussi squeaked, bounced with happiness, and bolted back into her room.
- ! '''Balls.'''
- They got out.
- She got out.
- ! '''The Doctor is Death.'''

:startParagraphs:
- ! 'A.N: Thank you all for clicking on this story  I will warn you, a lot of the
  stuff in this first chapter isn''t going to make a lot of sense unless you read
  my last FanFic, The Howling Cub.'
- The new Doctor looked around, his eyes resting on the two women.
- The Doctor looked down at the monitor, clicking buttons as we went.
- Eliza was the first to talk.
- The Doctor gave a gentle look before walking towards her.
- Rose gulped, the tears still in her eyes.
- A few moments of awkward silence passed between the two, Eliza apparently becoming
  invisible.
- Taking her silence the wrong way, he walked around the TARDIS again.
- Rose was unwillingly able to crack a smile at his joke, but then did her best to
  hide it.
- The Doctor sighed.
- The Doctor appeared next to her, laughing manically.
- Like the Doctor proclaimed, they really did rip out of the Vortex.
- Eliza walked back into the TARDIS, running towards her room.
- Eliza grabbed a piece of paper from the stack and pulled out the all too familiar
  letter, setting it on her desk.
- Identical… Eliza thought as she compared the letters, both finished now.
- Knowing it was the wrong this to do, Eliza ran to Jason's old room.
- Eliza sighed in frustration and threw the Photo Album across the room, letting out
  an ear splitting scream.
- Eventually, she calmed down, and pulled out the letter again.
- Sighing, Eliza pocketed the letter, and stood up.
- Jackie answered it a few seconds later, rushing her in.
- She skipped out of the door, locking the TARDIS as she went past it.
- She heard a bark from inside, a bark that made her smile from ear to ear.
- And it was.
- The Doctor was wonderful and magical, but he could be late.
- But all fairytales must end.
- The comforting hum of the TARDIS engine startled the Doctor from his case of déjà
  vu.
- He stroked the console fondly and headed out the door.
- His mind strayed to his other companions, that always made him happy.
- Deciding that happy thoughts were not getting him anywhere, he decided to wallow
  in self-pity and visit the restaurant that he had been to with Rose, Jack and Mickey
  in his ninth regeneration.
- Alice sighed.
- Five painstakingly long hours later, Alice threw down the last rope and ran home.
- She sat down in her arm chair and picked up her favourite book, Harry Potter to
  drown her sorrows in Hogwarts.
- Alice was startled awake by her more-than-annoying alarm clock blaring out its ridiculous
  tune at the ungodly hour of 7 o'clock.
- She swung her legs over the covers and threw open her red satin curtains and blinding
  light filled the room.
- The chessboard was shifting fast between them and he studied the structure of it
  with surprise.
- The Master looked up from the console of his TARDIS as the alarm buzzed and blinked
  at the screen in surprise.
- It read as a type-90 hospital craft, which was baffling.
- Would Susan be on board the other craft?
- Still, in an insane, upside-down way, he trusted his other self to take care of
  her.
- Stripped of its chaotic, curling, overgrown pathways, the network looked rather
  forlorn, rather like a sheep that had been shorn.
- She crossed to a wall, where there was a half-sphere protruding.
- The Doctor was about to protest that, but then the TARDIS, ever so delicately, brushed
  against the first snap-mine.
- Everything within the TARDIS seemed to slow down, but the slowdown was asymmetrical.
- Everything not physically bolted down went flying violently into the opposite wall,
  which was the people, and tools, since all the furniture was firmly attached to
  the floor.
- Aislynn went to her desk in her office a few doors down, and pulled the tablet Dar
  had given her out of its cage, opening it up.
- Koschei picked himself up off the floor, bruises blooming on his body, and felt
  Susan's shock and dismay in his mind.
- He'd avoided reaching out to the Master since the last time.
- /Stop that!/ Koschei sent directly to the Master.
- Koschei had been the Master for most of his life.
- If he could see that his past was foolish and destructive, why couldn't the other
  version of him see it, too?
- /It's all pointless and irrelevant, now!
- /Rassilon's breath!/ Came the unexpected response, bitter and frustrated.
- /Blast radius?
- The Master rubbed his hand over his eyes.
- /Just...,/ his voice was tired suddenly.
- Crab puffs, Jake decided, get old fast.
- Adie was taking on mythical proportions for them all.
- She had never imagined that the Master would be so reluctant to talk to her that
  he'd do something like this.
- But why?
- Koschei frowned at the screen, thinking hard.
- /What are you on about?
- He'd been designing Möbius Loops and Time Loops and spitting out the occasional
  Snap Mine or Chrono-strand cluster.
- The interruption made him mistype a single digit on a Time Loop calculation.
- Susan had time to feel a moment of horror and fear before they hit the Trans-Möbius
  Barrier.
- Each member of the crew suffered the same fate; a flash of brilliant light, and
  then being somewhere else.
- They were falling, to be specific.
- The TARDIS fell like a meteor, trailing fire and gas behind it, lighting up the
  sky, flashing as it tumbled, until it impacted below, sending up a plume of steam
  and mud.
- The Time Lords also fell like stones, but more slowly.
- Dolce Nocturum had once been a thriving colony.
- In the space above the moon, a new star formed, rapidly growing larger until it
  became apparent that it wasn't a star at all.
- ! 'It took several hours for the bubble to burst: in its centre was a raw and gaping
  hole.'
- Landing upon a rock, the beetle turned around in several circles, then took an experimental
  bite.
- After eating several stones about as large as itself, it began to flap its wings
  restlessly, hopping from point to point, seeming to be disturbed.
- A crack appeared down the centre of its fat body, glowing.
- All around them, the other beetles were doing the same thing.
- The luckless Kza that discovered the crater, two hours later, made the mistake of
  poking its snout over the edge.
- Two hours later, there was no more moon.
- Jake waved the Mashas forward, and then dropped down as Madison leapt out and slashed
  the crab with her knives.
- Rose plummeted, feeling herself being put back together molecule by molecule, even
  as she saw the ground starting to rush towards her.
- The ground below her was solid white and she inside the white, feeling nothing one
  moment and then suddenly cold, wet, and terrified the next.
- The Doctor had the impression of a shining white thing and then he landed on something
  hard and bitterly cold.
- The bitter chill penetrated like a thousand knives.
- He struck upwards towards the light above him, fighting the weight of his clothes
  and the terrible lassitude that was coming over him, and finally broke the surface,
  gasping and sputtering.
- Koschei tumbled through the air, feeling snow moving through his body in its half-assembled
  state.
- He lay in a snow bank, gasping for breath, his hearts hammering madly, and new bruises
  joining the ones he'd gotten in the TARDIS.
- When he finally staggered to his feet, he looked about, trying to figure out where
  he was.
- He turned his head, catching sight of huge spars rising from the snow.
- There were the remains of a work site around him, but as he turned, he realized
  that he was the only living thing for miles around.
- Susan tumbled through the air, arms wind-milling, and saw the ravine rushing up
  towards her.
- She clutched it tightly, her arms nearly yanked from their sockets from the strain
  of stopping her fall.
- She wedged herself against the cliff wall, the ledge giving her some purchase, but
  the winds that blew through the canyon were growing stronger and her bathrobe was
  fluttering around her legs.
- /Please be quick, love.
- He withdrew slightly, so that he could concentrate on running and she squished herself
  back against the cliff face, thinking heavy, rock-like thoughts.
- They found the next Masha in the middle of a war zone.
- A minute later, the damage vanished.
- The Doctor coughed out gushes of icy cold water.
- Koschei turned until he could feel the direction Susan was in and then took off
  running.
- Rose closed her eyes and let herself feel the turning of this world.
- Most of all, she was thinking of her children.
- Martine-74 darted across the shattered concrete and then leapt from the collapsed
  freeway down to where a cluster of Thrax were patrolling.
- All her life Martine-74 had been alone.
- Now she had five sisters and one brother who didn't forget her.
- The construction site still had wreckage and machinery lying about that Koschei
  had to dodge.
- Of secondary concern, once she was safe, was the temperature.
- Once over the hill, the cliff became visible.
- The ledge upon which Susan found herself perched at least had the advantage of being
  rock-solid.
- Rose felt her fingers breaking through the surface of the snow and sighed.
- She pushed out of her hole and stood up, the full force of the wind nearly knocking
  her down.
- K-9 accessed the TARDIS and routed all available power, what little there was of
  it, to the infants in the medi-bay, shutting off everything else, even life support,
  to ensure that the tiny section of the ship in which the jars were housed had full
  power, heat, and all other necessary resources.
- K-9 stabilized the infants and then went into the hallway, whining softly.
- Construction site.
- /My brilliant, amazing man.
- Miles away, the Doctor looked up.
- Rose felt the cold bite of the wind and grimaced.
- She turned her head and realized that all the lumpy grey patterns around her were
  the outlines of bodies, hundreds of them, lying dead in the pristine whiteness of
  the snow.
- When she did take a step, the horrible crunching made her feel ill.
- Sophie-24 climbed up onto the huge hairy back of the Efapan, then reached back to
  Tella-19, pulling her up as well.
- Kimberly-21 and Martine-74 were on the ground, scouting alongside the slow moving
  Efapan.
- If she thought too hard about it, Sophie-24 was nervous about it as well.
- There were parts everywhere, more than enough for the construction.
- It had been here for years, possibly centuries.
- Adie woke slowly, her head aching.
- She sat up and looked at herself.
- Head injury, she realized.
- She pulled herself to her feet, using a chunk of wreckage.
- The field was horrifying.
- It was tenzonite, which was slow burning and gave off warmth without pumping out
  much in the way of toxic fumes.
- She rolled them as far as she could, then cut the tops off, and set them ablaze.
- ! 'Once lit, she went back to scrounging around the area, coming up with an old
  tarpaulin: she wrestled with this, trying to tie it against the wind, hoping that
  maybe she could enclose a bit more of the shuttle off.'
- She just hoped someone would spot her bonfires, because all she could see was a
  flat lake bed far off across the snowy wastes and the mountains behind her.
- Masha-20 looked up as she saw the impossible coming towards her.
- Now, she was staring at strangers.
- 20 looked around at the seventeen hours and five square miles that had always been
  her home and felt a sliver of fear.
- Koschei took a deep breath and tried not to think about the War.
- He'd waded through charnel houses, time and again, during the War, but he'd had
  Darginian at his back to trade quips with him, to make some sick, twisted joke in
  the midst of hell, which would pull him back and make him laugh again.
- Paradoxically, he both desperately wished she were here with him and was deeply
  grateful she was spared the sight.
- The drone was a lumpy sphere with two pincher arms sticking out of the sides of
  it.
- The wind was picking up, so he got himself into the Drone's cab and kicked it into
  life.
- He flew the rickety, pieced-together, Frankenstein's monster of a Drone out over
  the chasm and eased down the cliff wall until he was hovering beside his wife.
- Jake leapt from the horse and grabbed a hold of the Dragon's neck.
- /Everyone,/ she sent out to them.
- /I'm… sorry,/ Adie sent to the Doctor and Rose.
- The Master groggily shook his head and wondered why the world was pitching and swaying.
- He was lying on an ice floe, pitching and yawing as the frigid water tumbled through
  the frozen wasteland around him.
- He clung to the ice chunk, knowing that the water would kill him much faster than
  the freezing ice he was on.
- He was plunged into a deep pool at the bottom of the waterfall and the force of
  the impact stunned him a moment, before he recovered.
- Susan's presence here scrapped everything, the Lens, all of it.
- Adie looked around and pondered their situation.
- She hoped the area was enclosed enough to heat up a little soon.
- Beyond shelter, their most pressing need was dry clothes.
- Then she paused.
- The USG Cassiopeia was the largest ship of her class ever designed.
- All of its strengths hadn't saved the crew.
- The portal grew larger, much larger.
- Behind the small beetles came four massive ones, each half the size of the Cassiopeia
  itself.
- It was a genuine battle.
- The three large beetles approached each other, touching their long antennae together.
- The battle lasted fourteen hours and the Cklil fought with all of the viciousness
  for which their race was famed.
- Koschei grinned down at his wife, they had found supplies in a closed case in the
  back of the drone.
- They were dressed in Radiation suits from the cargo area he glanced over at Susan,
  lips twitching in amusement.
- He calculated the distance between them and the Doctor, checking fuel, and hoping
  the Drone's cobbled together engines could survive the trip.
- ! 'Scavenging among the dead was horrifying: but it had to be done.'
- /Koschei,/ she sent to him, /Do you think you can pick up the Doctor and Rose?
- He was angling towards the Doctor, following the jagged angry red of his mind, fingers
  curled around the joystick, hands steady, though his hearts were stuttering in his
  chest.
- /Grandfather, we're going to try to land near you.
- / Because he wanted to set up a ski resort and make lots of money?
- /I believe this was… hmmm.
- / Because crash landing the TARDIS and getting lost in a bloody blizzard really
  wasn't exciting enough,/ he grumbled.
- / Naw, this was back at the Academy, when we were really young and really stupid./
  he sent back, sounding disgusted.
- Adie paused.
- /Well she and the Master worked a while on a war weapon called the Manifold.
- /No, I wouldn't have put the Manifold in a bundle of anything.
- /Well the goal was to create a life form that could never be defeated.
- /They were based off of insects, bio-metallic insects.
- /Yes, but I thought there was a proximity factor.
- /You're the Doctor!
- / My sonic is frozen, Adie!/ her replied, sounding disgusted.
- /Sounds good.
- Koschei wasn't at all sure that he could eke out enough power to land in a controlled
  manner this time, but the other three were all strapped in behind him and the Drone
  was built to last, so it probably didn't matter too much.
- They stepped out into a field of wreckage.
- She had a point.
- Susan felt the incandescent rage in her gut that the Rani's workings always inspired
  in her.
- The Doctor headed into the teeth of the storm.
- Outside, the Doctor was climbing the tower determinedly.
- ! 'He could see the storm now, on the horizon: what they were currently feeling
  was only the fringes.'
- He then turned his attention elsewhere, searching for some sort of shelter.
- /Everyone,/ he sent, /Good news and bad news.
- /Bad news is...
- The Manifold could break out of the Loop and into the greater universe.
- An insect species, they had long ago converted the cities below them to hives.
- They shattered into swarms of silvery insects of about the same size; and it was
  swarm-on-swarm battle.
- Then came the sound of rain, the sound of hard little bodies striking their own
  hives, pouring from the skies in streaks of silver and black streaks.
- Then the rain was over.
- /We'll burn that bridge when we cross it./ the Doctor's mind touched hers, as he
  spoke to her, and she could feel the 'flavour' of his mind, the distinct differences
  between him, Susan, Rose, and Koschei, how each of them was unique and different.
- She was being pulled into a sort of five-way gestalt, though it was nowhere near
  as deep as what she could feel coming from Susan and Koschei.
- /I can see the opening,/ Susan added and her greater understanding of their perceptions
  was added to Adie's and she could see the structure of the tear, like a wound in
  the flesh of the universe.
- The Doctor turned back to the tear, and they all studied it with the new vision
  that the others were providing.
- /That's them.
- The tear was surrounded by swarms of...
- Rose and Koschei's maths, much of which was quite solid, was finding that other
  portions had staggering sequence gaps.
- Perched in front of him, on a bar on the antenna where he clung, was a tiny silvery
  creature, the size of a fruit wasp.
- Was there more than one...?
- He held his breath, held his thoughts, even to himself.
- The tiny silver wasp stopped bobbing its head abruptly.
- /Fabulous,/ Koschei retorted with a sigh.
- /Yes, South, straight south, about a half a mile,/ he informed them as he pocketed
  the screwdriver.
- It had the squared blocky design of 35th century Earth and it reminded him of a
  lost colony story he remembered hearing.
- It had indeed crashed, leaving a long furrow in the earth.
- They stepped out of the shelter, wrapped up like mummies and felt the icy cold like
  knives stabbing into them.
- He blinked his eyes hard against a sudden rush of tears.
- Still, the others were coming; the ship had to be cleaned out; he didn't want them
  to have to wade through all this.
- When this gruesome task was done, with him desperately wishing for a shower, he
  took a moment to try to restore power.
- He quickly realized that it must be a medical transport ship of some sort.
- /Jackpot!/ he called back to the others.
- /Don't draw too much attention to us!
- /I know.../ He looked up at the sky, /I know.
- Koschei reached the ship well before the others and the run kept him warm.
- ! 'It was a gigantic piece of shrapnel, and there were wires underneath it: no power
  until the wiring was free.'
- He stepped outside, the bitter wind making him gasp, and went to work.
- He'd not been working long when the wind changed in its tone, it was starting to
  roar and howl.
- As if his words had summoned them, figures appeared out of the whirling white.
- Rose waved and the Doctor waved back, urging them on.
- Forty-five seconds later, there was an enormous WHUMP noise, and then a truly awful
  racket.
- Tamara-61 had spent her time in an advanced war zone, five hours of starship battles
  and planetary bombardment had given her a pale complexion and a crewman's jumpsuit
  that adjusted to temperature.
- The Doctor helped Susan pull the mattresses down and they shoved them up against
  each other in one of the smaller storage rooms.
- They ate some of the tinned supplies from the drone and then curled up together
  on the mattresses.
- The Master was slogging through the blizzard, moving slowly.
- Too late, he caught sight of the beetle.
- He ducked, rolled, but wasn't quite fast enough.
- He brought his blaster around with his other hand, his only hand, now, lurching,
  off balance.
- But it wasn't over.
- He didn't pass out, quite, but his senses went fuzzy and grey.
- Koschei jolted awake in alarm and with the echo of terrible pain.
- She got up and headed into the Medi-bay and began packing.
- There was no help for it.
- /If I give you the damnable clones, will you get Susan out of here?/ he snapped
  at his other self.
- It wasn't as good a plan, but the self-destruct sequence of his TARDIS, if wired
  correctly, should still be able to collapse the Möbius Grouping.
- /How exactly?
- He pushed himself off of the wall where he had been resting.
- /Once I reach my TARDIS, I should be able to slingshot you out,/ he sent back.
- /What are you talking about?
- /Fine.
- The word 'clear' faded from his mind, as an enormous buzzing sound filled the air.
- He barely ducked its stinger, swung the blaster around, fired and missed.
- It came at him again and he rolled to the side; and then his luck ran out.
- He screamed.
- He had several confused thoughts; the stinger had stuck into the wall behind him,
  and so he had avoided an injection of venom.
- /What's wrong?
- This close to the Master the slender golden thread was strong enough for them both
  to see it clearly.
- He helped her put on the backpack, then kissed her fiercely, before releasing her.
- For all of her conflicted emotions, the instant she'd felt his pain, all she could
  think about was getting to him and helping him.
- She could feel him, he was not that far away, but the blizzard obscured everything
  around her.
- The Master awoke in a haze of pain, rather surprised that he was awakening at all.
- He shifted forwards and the pain of it wrenched a scream from him.
- His left arm was useless, pinned to the wall and with the hand nothing more than
  a charred and bloody stump.
- He looked around frantically, wondering if this was finally it and getting really
  angry about it.
- Susan pushed through the rising blizzard, blinking against the snow.
- A large misshapen lump beneath the snow caught her eye and she stared at it for
  long moments not quite recognizing it.
- Her beautiful TARDIS was lying there, in a crater that was already half-filled with
  snow.
- She climbed up a hill and ahead of her saw the ruins of what might have been a small
  town.
- She had a moment of stunned surprise.
- He closed his eyes for a moment.
- She no longer looked the way she had in the Tower.
- Now it was all recalled, in vivid shades of forgotten colour against a black-and-white
  world; the reds of her hair, the chocolate brown of her eyes, the pale skin, flushed
  now with her exertion.
- Susan stepped back behind the wall and pressed her forehead against the rotting
  concrete, her hearts breaking.
- She peered cautiously around the wall to watch him struggling.
- It was only when she had given him the requested distance that the Master put down
  the blaster, putting it in his pocket, where he could grab it easily if she came
  too close.
- He couldn't help the scream that tore itself from his throat, and he crumpled forwards,
  falling into the icy cold of the snow, his face buried in the wetness, numbing instantly
  from the chill.
- The shock of pulling himself free should have dissipated the illusion.
- He was startled out of his wits by the sight of her.
- His mind was having trouble processing what his eyes were seeing.
- You arse, he thought to himself.
- Susan knelt in the snow, searching around the base of the TARDIS for the Equilibrium
  Switch.
- She fished a key from a hidden compartment above the door and shoved it open, the
  two of them tumbling to the floor inside.
- He lay there, panting and wheezing, feeling the temperature difference slowly thawing
  him out.
- He gave a great gasp.
- He watched her working and remembered another time, so long ago, when she'd designed
  the cure for the Cheetah Virus.
- She'd looked the same, he realized.
- He thinned his lips, but managed not to scream as the shoulder shifted slightly
  under her ministrations.
- The Doctor sat down and raised an eyebrow at Adie.
- ! 'The film started with a long shot of a silver wall that filled up half the sky:
  it took several seconds before it became apparent that this was a portion of a gigantic
  insect.'
- In seconds, the screen dissolved into chaos.
- Pods fell like rain, and from the pods, more insects emerged; tiny ones and monstrous
  ones, in countless numbers.
- ! 'The sky parted to reveal a cruiser, bigger than all but the very largest bug:
  bigger than the falling skyscrapers; a spaceborn city.'
- Adie's face was pale and she was silent as she watched.
- Diana-37 was learning that she didn't like swamps.
- She was not, by any stretch of the imagination, an engineer and that became more
  and more apparent as she worked.
- She'd gone from the medi-bay straight to the lab, checking up on the babies, emptying
  out the waste, cleaning the filters, and refilling their nutrients.
- She'd been keeping them in the TARDIS, instead of on Gallifrey, because of what
  had happened before.
- /Well, a man would have to be mad to put up with your family, but you're worth it,
  my hearts,/ he teased.
- He had dreamed of her.
- He felt a bit groggy and slow, but he raised his hand to his face and blinked in
  surprise at it.
- The door opened and a curvy body sheathed in a gray set of overalls, the sleeves
  and ankles rolled up, and carrying a tray, entered the room.
- He stared at her with his mouth open, unable to believe his eyes, as she set down
  the tray and smiled at him.
- It was a long time before the Master had the strength to let Susan go.
- He understood all at once, as realization flooded into him.
- As usual, her irritation was short lived.
- She was so beautiful.
- She was helping to rebuild Gallifrey.
- She pulled his head down into a kiss, wrapping her arms around him, her body pressed
  against his.
- His mind stuttered to a halt.
- He knew he should have felt pleased, but he couldn't quite manage it.
- ! 'He stood for a moment like a statue: and then his arms tightened around her,
  as if he was afraid she would vanish if he released her.'
- He tried to say something, but couldn't.
- He held her for a moment, just feeling the way their hearts beat out the same rhythm,
  trying to take in every experience, wanting to absorb every texture, the softness
  of her hair, her lips beneath his own, the way her arms felt around him, the mound
  of her breasts, and the swell of her hips.
- He was scared though.
- She tilted her chin and looked into his eyes.
- The Mashas jumped up and ran forwards, following Diana-37 and Jake-77 onto the air
  car, then Zoi-29 set it in motion, and they dived towards the city below them.
- Adie flinched a little at this.
- It had been an old Dalek battlecruiser, back in the day, but there were no Daleks
  aboard it now.
- The scavenging Vridia had occupied the vessel for some years, working hard to decipher
  the secrets that had been left there, and had had some success.
- Now, after countless hundreds of resets, something had entered the Loop, and their
  recognition of their predicament came months earlier than it otherwise would have.
- With every port and airlock sealed, the Vridia settled in to wait, confident that
  even the pincers of the biggest beetles couldn't penetrate the tough Dalekenium
  skin of the battle cruiser.
- They flew in on delicate wings, more pewter coloured than the bright silver wasps,
  shinier than the rather dull beetles, adding a new shade to the silvery-grey cloud.
- The battle lasted fourteen minutes.
- When the Manifold moved on, there was not so much as a speck left to mark where
  the battle cruiser had once been.
- In the medi-bay, the heat had brought the room temperature up to at least 60 degrees,
  and Rose could finally feel her fingers and toes again.
- Nearby, Adie struggled into the one she had been able to find, while Rose turned
  to do the same with a slightly larger one.
- Devorah-4 was using the buck knife in her hand to carve little wooden horses.
- Kayla-8 sat next to her, repainting her boots, which had gotten pretty scraped up
  in the last Loop.
- Cassidy-9 was sitting by the fire, telling stories to the younger numbers.
- He was only human, but he was the world to her.
- It was a blow against her already fragile psyche, and Adie found herself reeling.
- So much had happened.
- But all of that was overridden by the knowledge that she was going to be seeing
  the Master, going to be working with him, and it was just too much at that moment,
  on top of all she had gone through.
- Koschei turned and followed after her with a sigh.
- They exited the ship and Koschei was very glad for the insulated uniform.
- For some reason, the Doctor seemed not to hear that comment, stomping off through
  the snow with his hands shoved into his pockets, glaring at nothing.
- Adie moved more briskly after them, wondering what was behind those walls the Doctor
  had erected and why the people who loved him most in the universe were also so terribly
  scared of him.
- They were sitting, side by side, in the stone igloo.
- Susan lay curled against the Master, but her mind was split in two.
- She loved Koschei, was bonded to him so deeply that she could feel his confusion
  and the fight inside of him with every fibre of her being.
- Koschei was fighting to accept and that made her love him even more.
- /We can't leave him behind, Koschei, he's falling apart already,/ she sighed and
  could feel his agreement.
- /Of course.
- /Yes, of course.
- /No, you want us both to be happy, that's never wrong, love.
- /Yes, love,/ she sent back to him, wrapping her mind around him, embracing his hearts
  from a distance, her love for him so vast and deep that there was no end to it.
- Rose was tired, cold, and rather hungry, as she trudged through the snow.
- She came around a pile of strewn boulders and saw a hill rising up in the direction
  they were headed.
- Suddenly, the big bug fell apart into its smaller selves and Rose fell through a
  rain of metal insects, landing hard, and rolling to her feet quickly.
- A swarm of Wasps rose around them and several of the tank-like Beetles shook the
  snow off of themselves and trundled after them.
- Rose was using every ounce of her Time Lord strength to put on more speed.
- She hit a slick patch, her feet going out from under her.
- She felt a sudden jarring impact, as though something heavy had struck her in the
  back.
- He fell into the snow beside Rose, trying not to cry, or panic.
- He wrapped her quickly in his coat, packing her wound as tightly as he dared and
  lifted Rose's unconscious body in his arms.
- As soon as they got into the cold, dark medical bay, Adie started prepping a bed
  and he settled Rose into it.
- Koschei slammed the door to the TARDIS and ran to the console.
- The sound of scratching and the view on the scanner confirmed the Locusts' location,
  they were bumping off the shields for now, but that wouldn't hold them for ever.
- Within a minute, the console began beeping at him warningly.
- It was immediately possible to tell when the first locust had gotten all the way
  to the hull of the TARDIS; the sound of crunching was awful.
- The console brightened and began to hum, power flowing into the boards.
- ! 'It didn''t stop the sound of crunching: but it helped.'
- Adie had her hand forwards, about to make the exact same gesture that Koschei had
  just made.
- Koschei watched her go in some confusion, but his attention was immediately claimed
  by the lab.
- He ignored the lab for a moment and went to the wardrobe room.
- Shirts, ties, jackets, all still here.
- Underneath it, folded carefully, was a torn and dirty white Acolyte's robe from
  the Tower of the Visionary.
- The box had the neckties and shirt, her robe and a small vial, with a lock of Susan's
  hair from her second regeneration in it, a single chocolate brown curl.
- Choosing a different shirt and trousers, he shut up the wardrobe and leaned against
  it, shoulders shaking.
- The Doctor stood helplessly by as Rose fought for her life.
- She knew perfectly well that TARDIS didn't care about random girls who showed up
  sometimes to do maintenance.
- Now it would be leaving her, going with its pilot, of course it would, what else
  had she expected?
- Susan woke up and kissed the Master softly, feeling a degree of contentment that
  had been conspicuously absent for the last few days.
- He was himself.
- /Susan, Rose's been hurt, we're coming to you now,/ Koschei informed her and she
  slid from the bed and began grabbing up her clothes in haste.
- A moment later, the Doctor came in, carrying a slight blonde Time Lady in his arms.
- The Master stared at him.
- After everything, all the drama, the ranting, the monologues, the only thing left
  was his old friend, who needed him, and himself giving comfort.
- He looked at Susan and understood completely.
- Maureen-65, Nikki -69, Madison-17, Shevia-48 and Sky-52 moved through the woods
  in absolute silence.
- They had a sister being held captive by a group of hunters.
- Koschei crawled out from under the console of the Master's TARDIS with a sigh.
- An alarm buzzer went off and he looked around frantically, trying to figure out
  where it was coming from.
- Inside, looking up at him was a pair of acid yellow eyes, blinking slowly.
- /Susan!/ he shouted.
- Adie gave him a meaningful look, and then gathered the others.
- She lay like a dishrag in his arms, her eyes blank and flat, unseeing.
- The Master came running into the lab and stopped.
- The Master sighed deeply.
- The thought of the clones being scared had literally not occurred to him before
  this moment and he knew it should have.
- Koschei nodded and ran out of the room.
- She looked back and forth between him and the Master.
- The Master stilled and looked at Koschei as though he'd never considered that before.
- Tomoko shook Koschei's hand.
- Koschei looked at his other self and nodded.
- Tomoko stared at the Master.
- She rubbed the bridge of her nose, feeling stunned that she could see their side
  of the issue with such dazzling clarity.
- However, the plain fact was that she was between a rock and a hard place.
- /Susan is not going to be happy about that last bit,/ Koschei sent to the Master.
- /What else could I do?
- They studied each other, Koschei with all the history of that previous body there
  in his own memories.
- He was across the room, his arms around his other self, before he realized it, and
  the Master was burying his face in his shirt, shaking as the agony of his loss washed
  over him.
- Moira-3 raised the binoculars to her eyes and studied the massed army that was gathered
  on the plain beneath them.
- Diana-37 nodded, glad that Jake hadn't heard Moira-3 call him 'the boy'.
- What were they going to do with them all, once they were free of the Loops?
- The Doctor sat by Rose's bedside, holding her hand and watching the monitors on
  her vitals.
- She pushed into the console room and saw two pairs of legs sticking out from under
  the console and she nearly laughed aloud.
- Susan's hearts stuttered and she was breathing fast, as she suddenly was faced with
  the prospect of the Mashas trying to execute the Master.
- /For Omega's sake, stop scaring her,/ Koschei snapped at the Master.
- /...Sorry.
- The Master obviously felt bad when he saw the look on Susan's face.
- The Doctor and Rose came in then, Rose moving slowly and looking pale.
- The Master went into Engineering and stopped, staring.
- In awkward silence, they worked together, neither of them having any clue what to
  say.
- Tomoko-6 looked surprised and then hugged him back.
- Susan felt the Master's disgruntlement and went looking for him.
- Koschei was working under the console, while the Doctor and Tomoko pored over the
  details of the Manifold, heads together as they worked.
- Tomoko-6 reached for the sandwiches, but her hand stopped halfway there, distracted
  by the information on the notepad; after which she scowled furiously, scrolling
  back and forth.
- Tomoko followed them to the computer terminal and sat down in the chair, checking
  for a particular type of interface, then scowling when it wasn't there.
- ! 'On the screen there was an animated face: Tomoko-Construct''s animated face.'
- The screen dissolved into static and then cleared again.
- Were they interchangeable, or was she with him now because she felt sorry for him?
- Rose took the tablet from Tomoko with a frown.
- Sara-7 and Tyler-18 were just staring at her, aghast, as though they couldn't believe
  what she was saying.
- They were standing in the snow, the mountains rising above them and the Master's
  TARDIS, looking like a dirty boulder set in the middle of the plain, was behind
  them.
- Koschei sighed and looked up at Tomoko as she walked in.
- Adie came up from under the panel to check the reading, and scowled at the calibration.
- She paused thoughtfully.
- She had jerked her feet in automatically at the tone in his voice, then winced.
- The Doctor leaned over Rose's shoulder, his hands full of dangling cables, and peered
  at her screen.
- Tomoko looked at him seriously.
- She was working with one of the Master's tablets, filled up with all the files she
  could find on the Project.
- Tomoko looked up to see Evie-44, who had come into the console with a tray full
  of croissants, various condiments and a pot of tea and mugs.
- Well, Tomoko thought, he's won over Evie, that's a start.
- Tomoko took one of the croissants, put it on its little plate and set it down near
  the sonics, where Koschei could reach it.
- Susan walked into the room just then, her face set in a frown that matched Koschei's.
- There was some grunting and a sizzle and then the dimmed lighting came up and the
  console lit.
- Tomoko found the sealed chamber Koschei had told her about and the masks hanging
  outside of it.
- It was like stepping into a rainforest, only the trees were stretched out on frames,
  growing in regimented patterns, turned into a filtration system for the air.
- Tomoko poked at one of the square trees.
- It hovered near her and displayed the correct number and instructions on how to
  shift the charge properly.
- The butterfly's message board shifted to display manufacturing information and computational
  specifications.
- Tomoko wondered about the butterfly, even as she followed it.
- It led her through the forest, until she reached a table with a pile of crystal
  blocks scattered across it.
- Instantly, the low level mist began to shift, the electrical currents got stronger
  and she could glimpse the floor, which was set with copper tiles and runnels to
  redirect excess water.
- Underneath were a series of glass tubes that had water flowing through them at various
  speeds.
- It felt like paper in her hand, but it hadn't torn from the hook and wasn't even
  very damp, so it must be something else.
- Tomoko could, with sufficient effort, read Gallifreyan text; but to do so would
  run her up against the cooling issues she always had, and there was an easier way.
- Tomoko looked at the way she had come and considered.
- On the screen, the face of Tomoko Construct came up.
- I know you expected me back home weeks ago and I wish I could be there with you
  more than I can say.
- I hate this project though.
- The Master has been like a block of ice through it all.
- They brought in a girl, half-feral, we're going to have to flush all the other clones
  and restart.
- Tomoko found her eyes brimming briefly, but swiped the tears away impatiently and
  read the note again.
- The Sistron Articles scrolled across the screen, a series of rules and laws about
  how, when, and to what purposes cloning could be done.
- Tomoko was silent for a long time.
- Tomoko paced back and forth in the cooling chamber.
- It was a room with strips of orange lighted panels on the walls and a pillar of
  metal with a thousand sparkling blue lights flashing up and down it.
- Tomoko spent most of her life feeling muzzy-headed.
- The future meeting with Guinn would do for now, as a token to get everything up
  and running.
- There was so much to be done.
- Tomoko pondered the Time Lord, her mind whirling through analysis and deductions,
  running through all the reasons that she might have come here and then popping up
  the most likely one.
- Koschei looked up as Tomoko came into the console room, adjusting his shields so
  that she wasn't so hard to look at straight on.
- Susan and Guinn appeared in the archway and Koschei went to hug and kiss her.
- /With my life,/ he agreed and then took Susan's hand and led her out.
- They materialized in a desert realm, sand blowing across the dunes.
- Jake sat and listened.
- The girls listened intently; and then they started to pick up on it.
- There was almost a riot.
- Diana-37 was looking at Jake, watching him, studying his face.
- There was a bit of a ragged cheer.
- Koschei was lying on the floor of the TARDIS playing pick-up sticks.
- That left Koschei with Doctor-amusing duty.
- Adie approached Jake shyly.
- Adie's hands jumped to her mouth.
- Koschei made the effort to interact with them all.
- Tomoko came in with some folded cloth in her hands.
- It was a stealth suit.
- He walked over the nano-fabricator and checked it.
- Diana-37 stepped out into the freezing air and felt the chill on her skin with a
  shock.
- A beetle trundled over the hill towards her, moving slowly but inexorably towards
  the two TARDIS.
- Diana had Nikki and Neveah as her team.
- A wasp dived at Neveah and she dodged a moment too late.
- It was Evie-44 that was snared first.
- Susan had rushed over from her TARDIS, with K-9, and was scanning them for injuries.
- The damage was horrifying.
- Susan chivvied them into the medi-bay, K-9 at her heels, and went to work.
- It was the silver goop that was the worst.
- Koschei looked up from under the console and blinked at her, looking tired and rather
  worn.
- Some time later, the Doctor and Tomoko trooped out into the snow.
- The Doctor was waving his sonic about as they went and then they both froze as a
  cricket, the size of a fingernail leapt from the snow to land on Tomoko's collar.
- When Guinn walked into his TARDIS, he felt like stepping in front of a firing squad
  would have been less nerve-wracking.
- He looked around the room and saw the same face, duplicated many times, but each
  one with different shades of emotion.
- There was dead silence in the room.
- There was a delay of about a minute and then they moved, shuffling away from the
  hallway, parting like the red sea.
- The Doctor stepped forwards and walked with Guinn, as he headed towards engineering
  and he was grateful for the implicit support of the gesture.
- Susan smiled at him and headed back to the medical bay.
- The Mashas all stared after him as he walked down the hallway, until he was well
  away; and then immediately fell into whispered conversations with each other.
- The sad part was that he found that he couldn't blame them at all, not for any of
  it.
- I am so sorry that we never found you.
- Secondly, you are my best friend, Mels.
- There are good times and hard times in your future too.
- I woke up confused, but your note helped me put my thoughts in order.
- Honestly, I don't deserve to be called your friend.
- One thing I can say about myself is that I thought my parents abandoned me.
- At this point, I don't deserve to be loved by you or my mother.
- I'm not sure how to get this letter to you since you are traveling with the Doctor,
  so it may be a while before I can send it.
- Thanks for reading!
- ! '''Are you...'
- He squashed it and he felt the two sides condense, as though they were sliding over
  a smaller, inside ball.
- ! '''What are you?!'''
- ! '''Bloody TimeLord science...'
- He tried to move it, slide the pieces into a position that would allow him to inspect
  the cube inside, but to no avail.
- When back at the console room, the Doctor placed the little orb inside an up-turned
  fez-like hat he had encountered at a market in the Ylurt system.
- Also, they didn't call it a fez.
- The TARDIS, for the moment, was between destinations and just sort-of ambling through
  the time vortex, giving the Doctor some thinking time whilst he was on his holiday.
- ! '''The fall of the Eleventh,'' Dorian had said, all that time ago.'
- It was strange, it seemed, how many times this body, his eleventh regeneration,
  had either died or been so close to death that it was a genuine concern.
- Well, that's today's self-esteem down the drain.
- He began setting the coordinates for a moon he'd been told about whilst at the market
  - a tiny thing no bigger than Earth's moon, and with similar gravity to Earth itself,
  seeing as it was so dense.
- According to the nice ice vendor, it was covered in cave systems that, once you
  enter, you can never leave.
- But, then he got distracted by an alert telling him there was a little malfunction
  somewhere in the software, and he'd started updating and re-inventing the whole
  thing, and then he found that little orb.
- He'd never seen anything like it.
- Pocketing the little orb as it glowed and ebbed, he landed the TARDIS onto the rocky
  terrain of Gug's only populated area - Gugland.
- As he explored the ex-tourist town of Gugland, he came to the sudden realisation
  that he had become what he despised most.
- Yes, his life was perhaps more perilous than the usual holiday-goer, but that was
  only now and then.
- But, then again, perhaps being a tourist wasn't the worst thing in the world.
- Despite how his touring habits might disgust him, the Doctor continued to wander
  around Gugland, stumbling across a building that seemed to be some sort of information...
- Moving inside, the Doctor found a leaflet that showed a single picture of the most
  famous cave - the one people so often gave themselves to.
- The mouth of the cave itself was indeed hypnotic.
- It was an odd feeling, to be invited by a photograph, but he knew what was going
  on.
- Pulling out the orb, it's shifting surface pulled back, almost on it's own, and
  revealed to the Doctor the small cube inside.
- ! '''So you were a bomb!'''' the Doctor said, smiling a concerned smile.'
- What was it here for?
- And why had it activated here and now?
- Tightly grasping the small thing, he dashed back to the TARDIS, putting the orb
  back inside the fez/pizza, and took that to a bomb-shelter room he'd installed a
  while ago.
- The voice always sounded close, but not near, if that made sense.
- Eventually the Doctor slowed to a trot, unable to keep up the pace.
- Of course, it was pitch-black aside from the green glow of his screwdriver, so he
  couldn't tell if something was there or not.
- He kept moving forward, aiming for the sounds that seemed to be at his sides.
- The Doctor suddenly started to think logically, how would someone survive down here?
- ! '''Hello?'''
- The Doctor turned to his side, looking for a wall to get his bearings, but he had
  seemed to have reached a clearing, which wasn't good.
- He read somewhere that if you live forever, the chances of you becoming trapped
  in an inescapable place rocket, because when you live forever you experience everything,
  especially with a time machine.
- He decided that the best way to go was forward, but he did so with a gulp and a
  closed eye, immediately checking that the doorway behind him hadn't closed off.
- As the cave stretched on and on, he started to think that this was an incredibly
  bad idea.
- Soon, however, he started to see and odd blue light somewhere ahead.
- ! '''Okay, what is that?'''
- He headed in the direction of the blue light, silently computing what the likeliness
  of this being a trap was.
- ! '''Anyone there?'''
- ! '''Maybe,'' someone replied.'
- ! '''Maybe?'''
- The Doctor headed towards the light, which, by the way, is never a good idea.
- From all his experience, the Doctor had, at some point, concluded that there must
  be a God somewhere up there, amongst the cosmos, watching everything and flowing
  through every little creature it held.
- Of course, when the Doctor saw what was generating the bright, blue light now close
  enough to see, he realised it could be both.
- Before him stood the bright, curling column of moving light and silent power, kept
  within the six-segment console in a form he hadn't seen before - some type of rocky
  format.
- But it was a TARDIS.
- ! '''This is impossible...'''
- ! '''You see it?'''
- The Doctor didn't turn to look at who it was.
- The entire cave system, it was corridors, corrupted by time...
- ! '''You''re not mad.'''
- He decided to look, instead, at whoever was talking to him.
- ! '''I''m not mad,'' he said, looking at the floor.'
- ! '''What, what is it?'
- ! '''That means they''re coming,'' he said, the fear around him palpable.'
- ! '''Take me out?'''
- ! '''I...'''
- ! '''Just tell me,'' the Doctor said, helping the boy up in agreement to get him
  out.'
- ! '''I don''t know...'''
- ! '''Right,'' the Doctor nodded, unsure of where to go from there.'
- ! '''Don''t drop it,'' said the boy.'
- ! '''Never?'''
- ! '''Dangerous...'
- ! '''It''s okay, it''s fine...'
- ! '''I don''t...'
- ! '''Hey, hey hey,'' the Doctor dropped to him, joining the boy on the floor.'
- ! '''Okay.'
- The boy remained silent, watching the Doctor thoughtfully as he bounced up, leaving
  the box on the floor.
- ! '''Okay, okay I think I can work this,'' he said scanning the console.'
- ! '''Because...'
- ! '''Why do you say so?'''
- Trauma, he thought.
- It scared him to think, though.
- ! '''Not the console,'' the Doctor said, continuing his earlier train of thought.'
- ! '''It''s a ship,'' he said.'
- ! '''A ship...'
- ! '''Space...'
- ! '''And endless life,'' the Doctor said, smiling to him.'
- He nodded, but that small moment of light was snuffed out by a sound.
- The boy jumped at the sound, recognising it and drawing back in terror.
- ! '''Hello?'''
- Nothing but the darkness, and the noise.
- ! '''You know,'' he said to the boy.'
- ! '''What''s your point?'''
- ! '''My point is that, even though a TARDIS can change it''s desktop theme, it''s
  hardware is still the same.'
- ! '''Well, you wanna stay here and wait for...'
- ! '''They don''t come into the light.'
- ! '''Lights!'
- ! '''You turned on the lights!'''
- ! '''It''s a TARDIS, the greatest ship in the universe.'
- ! '''No...'
- ! '''The Doctor, I told you...'
- ! '''No...'
- ! '''I don''t know.'
- ! '''Memory loss.'
- ! '''Important,'' the boy said, as though remembering a fact he had been told to
  remember.'
- ! '''Are they coming back?'''
- ! '''I don''t know.'
- ! '''You''re okay, you''re okay,'' the Doctor said, thinking.'
- After a little while, the lights started to flicker.
- It was a structure similar to most TARDIS ships - confusing but regular.
- It had come from the shadow.
- ! '''The TARDIS is psychic,'' the Doctor reasoned.'
- ! '''But I know you,'' said the shadow.'
- ! '''Doctor?'''
- ! '''Keep walking,'' the Doctor said, trying to make it sound like it wasn''t an
  order.'
- ! '''The fault?'''
- ! '''Life?'''
- ! '''You know, my TARDIS said the exact same thing,'' he said, making conversation.'
- ! '''I am not a TARDIS,'' said the shadow.'
- ! '''And you are life,'' said the Doctor.'
- ! '''No I''m not,'' said the Doctor, smiling.'
- Even the boy stopped to watch.
- ! '''That''s why you turned out the lights,'' he said, looking at the shadows.'
- ! '''What is it talking about?'''
- ! '''We''re not in the universe anymore.'
- ! '''No, but there was a cave.'
- The shadow smiled at him again.
- The boy ignored it, standing as tall as he could against the shadow, staring into
  the mirage of a face, the twists of darkness that echoed hands, arms, bodiliness.
- ! '''Yes,'' said the boy.'
- ! '''Oh no, boy,'' it said, mocking again.'
- ! '''WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!'''
- But then, the shadows did something the Doctor could not do.
- It stopped him in his tracks.
- ! '''Come on,'' said the Doctor, pushing him on.'
- ! '''Doctor,'' Simuss said, stopping him.'
- He had rather hoped that hearing his name might have triggered some kind of memory
  leading to his lineage.
- Putting it to Simuss' chest, he heard the beating of a heart.
- The Doctor looked up to Simuss.
- But the Doctor couldn't find any words.
- ! '''You''re a Time Lord, Simuss.'
- It was as though a silent, heavy lift that had been stretching his heart strings
  was starting to lift, slowly, more so with every passing moment.
- This boy was in a TARDIS, stuck outside the Universe.
- ! '''Time Lord?'''
- ! '''Like me.'
- ! '''You?'
- He'd heard about this place just on his travels.
- The chances of him having passed by this place and gone on to a different attraction
  where infinite.
- He hugged Simuss, breathing in the air around him.
- The Doctor stood with new authority, no longer lost.
- ! '''Want to ask you what happened,'' he said to Simuss.'
- ! '''I couldn''t tell you,'' Simuss said.'
- ! '''We go the hell through them, Simuss.'
- ! '''I have no idea.'
- And with that, the Doctor burst into a full-on sprint, chasing the corridors, back-tracking
  every twist and turn, every lift and dip in the path, following that map he had
  so easily made earlier, for convenience sake.
- Simuss saw, however, in the Doctor eyes that there was more.
- That was the reason he had been lifted off his feet, why his eyes were glistening
  with hope and why he had burst into confidence and energy at one little revelation.
- Even so, there must be more.
- ! '''Doctor,'' Simuss said as they ran, knowing it was something he should bring
  up.'
- The Doctor stopped in his tracks, slapped in the face by this sudden revelation.
- The Doctor turned on the spot, watching the corridors for signs of malicious shadows
  creeping up on them, but there was nothing.
- Simuss wondered why this was.
- Funny, really.
- It meant that this was a trap.
- Of course the Doctor, still with a stupid smile, attempting to keep the atmosphere
  light said 'It's a trap!'
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''It''s my best Admiral Ackbar,'' the Doctor said, genuinely defensive.'
- ! '''And issue?'''
- He instantly started to sonic upwards, aiming at some lights above, trying to lock
  on.
- ! '''Doctor?'''
- The Doctor crouched to be as close to him as possible.
- ! '''Have you any idea what he is?'''
- ! '''The Doctor,'' he said, as though he were answering a teacher in a classroom.'
- ! '''He''s a killer,'' it said.'
- The whole room burst back into light, and the sound of shuffling feet leaving filled
  their ears again.
- ! '''Why do I feel like it wanted us to tell it that?'''
- ! '''Because they were cleverer than us,'' he answered.'
- ! '''But why.'
- ! '''Maybe...'
- ! '''Nothing.'
- The Doctor stopped.
- He remembered telling the Master - how he'd gone into denial, and then, later, had
  attempted to bring Gallifrey itself back.
- ! '''Because they were all destroyed, Simuss,'' he said.'
- This was it, he was going to tell this boy everything.
- Simuss looked barely 18, but for a Time lord that could be 1800.
- ! '''A Time War?'''
- ! '''Hell.'''
- ! '''By killing everyone.'
- ! '''River Song.'
- ! '''But you''re alive,'' Simuss said, somewhere between being doubtful and reassuring.'
- ! '''I try to make it, Sim.'''
- ! '''Well, you''re helping me.'
- ! '''I know the feeling,'' the Doctor said with a smile.'
- The two of them followed the rocky cavern to the next corner, where the blue light
  of the console was starting to become visible again.
- The hall-like opening was huge, tall and cold, which echoed with the blue light
  that illuminated it.
- ! '''What are you doing here?'''
- ! '''Here to help,'' it said.'
- ! '''Why would you want us out?'''
- ! '''Truth.'
- ! '''Travel.'
- ! '''Is this a trap?'''
- ! '''Release?'''
- ! '''You''re a creature.'
- ! '''All those people, all those hopeless, lost people who came into the caves.'
- The shadows fell silent, not wanting to answer.
- ! '''Help us,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''No,'' Simuss said, killing the Doctor''s sentence.'
- ! '''What is it?'''
- ! '''Would rather know what that is, or where they went?'''
- ! '''Fine,'' he said.'
- ! '''We did nothing!'''
- ! '''Me?'''
- ! '''It is one of three things we were born knowing,'' it said.'
- ! '''What was the second?'''
- ! '''The box.'
- ! '''We don''t know,'' it said, honestly.'
- ! '''When will it be ready?'''
- ! '''Third,'' Simuss ordered, wanting to know everything he could about this place.'
- ! '''That we are it''s eyes,'' the shadows said.'
- ! '''Any wanderers?'''
- ! '''Only humans,'' is said, slowly, thinking about it.'
- ! '''I was drawn here,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''What happened?'''
- ! '''Humans would wander in, and we would watch them be changed.'
- ! '''You''re talking as though...'
- ! '''Is what possible?'''
- ! '''You were changed, Simuss,'' the shadows said.'
- ! '''It''s called a chameleon arch,'' the Doctor said, his voice low.'
- Simuss looked at the shadows, which seemed to have shrunken away, ashamed.
- ! '''Not right now,'' he said.'
- ! '''Are you talking to us?'''
- ! '''Well, you''re the eyes, what happened?'''
- ! '''The lost their memories.'
- ! '''They went against their fears and walked into the darkness,'' the Doctor said,
  thinking.'
- ! '''Why not?'''
- ! '''That''s different, going from Time Lord to human is like regression.'
- ! '''The box?'''
- ! '''No, the box is the controlling entity.'
- ! '''It''s clever, annoyingly clever.'
- ! '''Because they''re in the box.'
- ! '''Why?'
- ! '''Maybe it didn''t choose to be in the box.'
- ! '''Will you?'''
- ! '''I might have to,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''Do you want yours?'''
- ! '''Of course I do, but do I need it?'
- ! '''Great!'
- ! '''Well, now you''re assuming I have one,'' he said, only half paying attention.'
- ! '''No, I said you assumed I didn''t.'
- ! '''So whoever was trying to hold this thing in new it was powerful.'
- ! '''Absolutely.'
- ! '''Then we''re powerless.'''
- ! '''We''re not?'''
- ! '''Just...'
- ! '''I can,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''What''s best?'''
- ! '''What''s best for us all.'
- ! '''We have to hope,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''But there might have been people down here for months.'
- ! '''No idea.'
- ! '''See that?'''
- ! '''You, Simuss,'' he said, almost accusingly.'
- ! '''It''s incentive,'' he said, his eyes shutting.'
- ! '''Am I?'
- He held up the box, looking at it with some reservations.
- After that second, a great wave of yellow-white light burst from the contents -
  streams of it, all coming from separate clock faces inside the box.
- One found Simuss, swallowing his face in a cloud of yellowed light, finding it's
  way inside through his eyes, ears, nose, mouth.
- Yet, from the box, there was another shade.
- It's light clouded that which emanated from the TARDIS console and the yellow light
  coming from all around.
- The green figure seemed to look at them, it's features ghostly and non-specific.
- The Doctor attempted to open his eyes, but they wouldn't obey him from the light.
- He noticed the red suit he had left behind at some point.
- But he knew something was coming.
- Simuss stirred, looking back up at the Doctor and looking around himself.
- Simuss ran to the nearest person as they struggled up - it was a young woman, maybe
  in her late teens - and helped her to her feet.
- There was maybe fifty of them.
- ! '''Hello humans!'''
- ! '''Is this Gug?'''
- ! '''It is!'''
- ! '''A cave system that was a scientific mystery,'' said a woman in her sixties.'
- ! '''I can tell you,'' the Doctor said with some reservations in his voice.'
- ! '''There was a box,'' Simuss said, solidifying the Doctor''s hope that he would
  have kept his memories.'
- ! '''It was a box that I couldn''t recognise,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''Changed us into what?'''
- ! '''Why are we listening to this?'''
- ! '''What''s wrong with my shoes?'''
- ! '''Where the hell are the caves?'''
- ! '''They left with the monster,'' Simuss said.'
- ! '''A spaceship disguised as a cave?'''
- ! '''A spaceship disguised as a cave,'' the Doctor repeated.'
- ! '''So...'
- ! '''To save you.'
- ! '''So what the hell are you going to do about it?'''
- ! '''Well, I''m going to take you all home,'' he said.'
- ! '''I thought you said the box was untraceable?'''
- ! '''We''re not tracking the box,'' the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '''But what do we say, to our families?'''
- ! '''I don''t know,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''My name is Harper,'' he said, his voice gruff but worried.'
- ! '''It is!'''
- Harper lead the groups of humans, along with the Doctor, towards Gug's tourist town.
- ! '''What''s this?'''
- ! '''Where is everyone?'''
- Soon the whole lot of them burst into an outrage, a howling mass of panicking humans.
- Soon the sounds of people blaming eachother broke out.
- ! '''Okay, everyone-'' he tried, but they yelled and howled, not letting him speak.'
- ! '''Thank you.'
- The Doctor started thinking.
- ! '''The plan,'' he said, ''is for me to go and collect my friend.'
- ! '''Why, can''t you do it?'''
- ! '''Not on my own.'
- ! '''Thoughtful?'''
- ! '''You haven''t seen my thoughts,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''I should have thought so!'''
- ! '''Right then,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''You hold on there!'''
- ! '''Trust me,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''I don''t give half a damn whether you''re a nurse or a vet or a bloody paleontologist,''
  she snarked, ''someone is going with you.'
- ! '''Okay, awesome!'''
- Simuss sighed and turned to the crowd.
- ! '''Is this the sort of situation you usually find yourself in...'
- ! '''I''m the Doctor, and yes, it is actually.'
- ! '''Usually.'
- ! '''So you though my family had followed me into the cave?'''
- ! '''If they went looking for you.'
- ! '''Told to?'''
- ! '''Possibly,'' he said.'
- ! '''Well, this is mystery, Harper.'
- ! '''You do this too much,'' Harper said.'
- ! '''Then why still do it?'
- ! '''Because I, occasionally, manage to make a difference.'
- ! '''I thought is was going good, yeah,'' he said, smiling as they reached the TARDIS.'
- ! '''It''s a box,'' he said.'
- ! '''I think she''s sexy,'' the Doctor muttered.'
- The Doctor moved on, unlocking the door.
- Harper sniffed and pushed the door inwards, and smirked.
- Harper stepped inside and the Doctor heard him take a breath, and he looked around.
- ! '''A different place...'''
- ! '''Something along those lines,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''Earth?'''
- ! '''Time Machine,'' the Doctor said, winking.'
- ! '''No one does!'''
- They landed suddenly and painfully (for Harper, at least) in Clara's front garden.
- ! '''Harper, Clara, Clara, Harper,'' the Doctor said, smiling.'
- ! '''Okay, so, green ghost thing inside a TARDIS, caves that aren''t caves and people
  going missing?'''
- The Doctor nodded.
- The Doctor gave her a grin as she readied herself.
- Clara threw her head back, loving it.
- Out the doors, Clara was greeted to a loud, unhappy group of people in very tatty
  clothing with dust on their faces.
- ! '''They''ve gone mad!'''
- ! '''Yes!'''
- ! '''Well,'' the Doctor nodded.'
- ! '''What''s all this?'''
- ! '''Oh, this is Simuss,'' he said, patting him.'
- She rolled her eyes as the Doctor walked out, into the now silent group.
- ! '''Well, any ideas?'''
- ! '''What are you doing?'''
- ! '''Asking them.'
- ! '''Am I?'
- ! '''So?'
- Harper fell silent, thinking.
- ! '''To hold you ransom,'' Simuss said.'
- ! '''What if it took more than it needed?'''
- ! '''Time Lord,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''So...'
- ! '''Which means tracking it''s TARDIS.'
- ! '''Right, off your high-horse you,'' Clara said.'
- ! '''Yes, right.'
- ! '''That''s it,'' he nodded.'
- She gave him a look.
- ! '''Now then,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''How do you expect us to go anywhere?'''
- ! '''Well...'
- ! '''Wait?!'''
- The Doctor took a breath.
- ! '''Well,'' Harper said.'
- ! '''They will be.'
- ! '''No idea,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''You really do have a huge ego, don''t you?'''
- The Doctor replied with a smile, and then started flicking controls.
- ! '''Do we know that for certain?'''
- ! '''Not for certain, but it''s all we have at the minute.'
- ! '''How do we know where to start?'''
- Clara though for a second, before smiling quietly.
- ! '''Exactly!'''
- ! '''So...'
- ! '''We know it would have gone straight there, in a line.'
- ! '''Any theories?'''
- ! '''What if it''s someone you already know?'''
- ! '''But you said that the dimension change inside the TARDIS was the reason you
  couldn''t sense me being a Time Lord, what if it did it for the green thing?'''
- ! '''Or it could be a TARDIS itself,'' Clara offered.'
- ! '''Where do monsters live?'''
- ! '''Look,'' the Doctor interrupted, eyes closed and breathing deeply.'
- He smiled.
- ! '''Home!'
- The Doctor looked up, at the console of his own TARDIS and shook his head.
- Clara's eyes shifted.
- ! '''We are.'
- ! '''So...'
- ! '''It''s wherever the big TARDIS is headed.'
- ! '''Ransom?'
- ! '''No, no no.'
- ! '''Wait- mouth?'''
- ! '''Mouth, door, whatever you want to call it.'
- ! '''How do you know all of this?'''
- ! '''The readings,'' the Doctor pointed.'
- ! '''Of sorts.'
- ! '''This...'
- ! '''This room, where the TARDIS is holding Gug.'
- ! '''Absolutely, we just need to find out how big the room is.'
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''Yeah, like...'''
- ! '''Yeah, the bigger-on-the-inside, it leaks outwards after damage to the system.'
- ! '''Then we find the exit, stroll into the console room.'
- ! '''What about the green guy?'''
- ! '''That''s the antagonist, I suppose.'
- ! '''Change!'''
- ! '''I don''t have to go anywhere.'
- ! '''How do we do that though?'''
- ! '''We show it what it''s doing.'
- ! '''And if not?'
- ! '''Then we do the dirty work ourselves,'' the Doctor said with a nod, swallowing
  his morality.'
- ! '''I''m not suggesting killing it, but maybe trapping it?'
- ! '''Good news,'' he said.'
- ! '''Yeah.'
- ! '''Well, there are a few odd readings coming from Gug, but I''m not sure what
  they are...'
- ! '''Nothing to do with it?'''
- ! '''Oh, I doubt it''s a coincidence, young padawan.'
- ! '''I think I''m worrying myself.'
- ! '''Here!'
- ! '''It was like a cave earlier,'' Simuss said.'
- Clara opened the door to a white-crystal, , almost liquid room.
- ! '''No, that''s not a cave,'' the Doctor said, with a smile.'
- Simuss and Clara both looked to the base of the pillar as it rose from the floor.
- ! '''Where are all the controls?'''
- ! '''On there.'
- ! '''...But it''s blank.'
- The Doctor walked over, into the centre of the huge room and started stroking the
  white, ceramic-looking console.
- ! '''Look,'' he said, wonder making his voice weak.'
- Simuss and Clara followed him out.
- Simuss, however, stepped towards the door - it was a circular door that opened automatically
  as he approached, as you would expect inside an old sci-fi movie.
- The Doctor started tapping the white console, it's invisible buttons glowing for
  a second as he touched them, then fading to white a second later.
- Clara and Simuss just stared at the sun, their eyes protected by the shields surrounding
  the TARDIS, feeling suddenly awfully small.
- ! '''Any progress?'''
- ! '''Not yet, getting there,'' the Doctor said as he worked.'
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''Not you, silly.'
- ! '''What did she do?'''
- ! '''She was flirting,'' the Doctor said, sounding to Clara like a disappointed,
  but not angry, dad.'
- Clara stroked her.
- ! '''Not sure.'
- ! '''Of course,'' Clara said.'
- ! '''Happy?'''
- ! '''Guys,'' Simuss called.'
- ! '''Well, you''re being all dad-y!'''
- ! '''Guys?'''
- ! '''You know,'' said the green figure as it hovered outside the TARDIS door, it''s
  emerald glow intruding upon the white space, ''for a man who claims to be the ''Oncoming
  Storm'', you are rather goofy, Doctor.'
- ! '''Form?'''
- ! '''Of course we have, don''t you recognise me, Doctor?'''
- ! '''Hostage?'''
- The Doctor laughed.
- ! '''Oh, I know, Doctor.'
- ! '''Wasn''t it obvious?'
- ! '''So.'
- ! '''Too easy, don''t be easy, Doctor.'
- ! '''Oh.'
- ! '''I do.'
- ! '''Seriously?'
- ! '''Then be clever.'
- ! '''Clever and lazy, that''s me.'
- ! '''Fine.'
- ! '''I''m not trying to hurt anyone, Doctor.'
- ! '''What do you think the master-plan is?'''
- ! '''Mass-conversion, probably.'
- ! '''There we are,'' the Doctor smiled.'
- Clara was uneasy, however.
- ! '''Yup?'''
- ! '''So it''s a Time Lord?'''
- ! '''Are you okay?'''
- ! '''Fine.'
- ! '''You say that a lot,'' she said.'
- ! '''The first Time Lord I''ve met in a while.'
- ! '''It''s inherent, I think.'
- ! '''You always get yourself into this mindset, that you''re a monster.'
- ! '''I have excellent taste, thank you very much.'
- He looked up to her, tears in his eyes that she hadn't noticed before.
- ! '''I was those two people''s worst fear, back on Earth II.'
- ! '''Doctor,'' Simuss interrupted.'
- ! '''How do you classify ''bad''?'
- ! '''A good man is one who fights his own for what''s right.'
- ! '''This is a waste of time.'
- ! '''How do we find them?'''
- ! '''It gave us a clue - the readings coming from Gug,'' Simuss added.'
- ! '''Radiation, coming from the centre.'
- ! '''It''s another TARDIS.'
- ! '''Stuck in another dimension.'
- ! '''He could get there because he''s pure energy at the minute...'''
- ! '''Painful.'
- ! '''Your mind couldn''t take it.'
- ! '''So what now?'''
- ! '''We go down.'''
- Clara took a moment to wonder what they were getting into.
- She bet the Doctor was too busy thinking to think.
- Eventually, Clara joined them in the TARDIS, their TARDIS, and gave the Doctor a
  punch on the shoulder.
- As they cascaded down into the moon, however, Clara saw the Doctor's face.
- ! '''So,'' she said, nudging him.'
- ! '''Really,'' he lied.'
- The Doctor, however, simply wasn't ready to see another Time Lord.
- They pushed through the doors, all three of them, stepping out into a console room
  that looked almost identical to the white one they had just left, only it was huge.
- ! '''Gug''s a TARDIS,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''The first mention of Gug in recorded history is over a million years ago,''
  Simuss said.'
- ! '''Until we came along, yeah,'' the Doctor nodded.'
- Clara found it hard to cope with the scale of it.
- ! '''So that''s two TARDISes,'' Clara said, wondering how important that was.'
- ! '''Where did they come from?'''
- ! '''How have we never seen them?'
- The Doctor span.
- Her hair was just the same as it had been, all that time ago.
- She was wearing the same things.
- ! '''I am,'' she said, her voice sending a painful shudder down his spine.'
- ! '''Susan?'''
- ! '''Grandfather?'''
- ! '''Hello,'' she smiled.'
- ! '''There wasn''t a way out,'' he said, his voice cracking.'
- ! '''The Daleks did,'' she said.'
- ! '''The Emperor died.'
- ! '''No, but the Universe caught up with it.'
- ! '''I grew old.'
- ! '''The hole Rassilon opened up by throwing through that gem was tiny, but it was
  a hole.'
- ! '''-and then we lost contact with both.'
- ! '''You died trying to run away?'''
- She looked ashamed, but he was so very proud of her.
- ! '''Seven.'
- ! '''Of course.'
- ! '''No, Susan.'
- ! '''I''m just a projection, but you should know, Grandfather.'
- ! '''Who?'
- ! '''This is just an echo of my last thoughts, Grandfather.'
- The Doctor started to cry and it broke Susan's heart, even as a projection, to not
  be able to hold him.
- Susan watched him, her eyes warm, until they snapped upwards.
- ! '''You''re here,'' she whispered.'
- ! '''Well, Susan,'' the green figure laughed.'
- ! '''Would rather know what that is, or where they went?'''
- ! '''Fine,'' he said.'
- ! '''We did nothing!'''
- ! '''Me?'''
- ! '''It is one of three things we were born knowing,'' it said.'
- ! '''What was the second?'''
- ! '''The box.'
- ! '''We don''t know,'' it said, honestly.'
- ! '''When will it be ready?'''
- ! '''Third,'' Simuss ordered, wanting to know everything he could about this place.'
- ! '''That we are it''s eyes,'' the shadows said.'
- ! '''Any wanderers?'''
- ! '''Only humans,'' is said, slowly, thinking about it.'
- ! '''I was drawn here,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''What happened?'''
- ! '''Humans would wander in, and we would watch them be changed.'
- ! '''You''re talking as though...'
- ! '''Is what possible?'''
- ! '''You were changed, Simuss,'' the shadows said.'
- ! '''It''s called a chameleon arch,'' the Doctor said, his voice low.'
- Simuss looked at the shadows, which seemed to have shrunken away, ashamed.
- ! '''Not right now,'' he said.'
- ! '''Are you talking to us?'''
- ! '''Well, you''re the eyes, what happened?'''
- ! '''The lost their memories.'
- ! '''They went against their fears and walked into the darkness,'' the Doctor said,
  thinking.'
- ! '''Why not?'''
- ! '''That''s different, going from Time Lord to human is like regression.'
- ! '''The box?'''
- ! '''No, the box is the controlling entity.'
- ! '''It''s clever, annoyingly clever.'
- ! '''Because they''re in the box.'
- ! '''Why?'
- ! '''Maybe it didn''t choose to be in the box.'
- ! '''Will you?'''
- ! '''I might have to,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''So he did it again,'' Simuss said, giving a humourless laugh.'
- ! '''He did what?'''
- The Doctor nodded.
- ! '''Post-traumatic stress disorder.'
- ! '''Well, it was regeneration energy, but it had festered.'
- ! '''I think I might be,'' she said.'
- ! '''Susan I need you to go back, into the record.'
- ! '''Now then,'' the Doctor said, whipping out his sonic screwdriver and lighting
  it up.'
- ! '''What that?'''
- The Doctor slid the sonic further and the TARDIS, his own TARDIS, began to materialise
  around him.
- ! '''Oh that''s brilliant!'''
- ! '''I should hope so.'
- ! '''I can show you,'' she said.'
- The hovered, watching down upon the crystalline TARDIS console room that had now
  redesigned itself, and there stood a man who the Doctor assumed to be Carltesque.
- He hobbled, his leg hurt - possibly even broken.
- A man walked in, the box under his arm.
- ! '''Stop?'''
- ! '''Carlteqsue, doing what you want to do would blow a hole in the side of the
  Universe.'
- ! '''Everything would go back to normal.'
- ! '''Because everything that happened was condensed.'
- The green energy began to swarm now, getting more impressive, more heated.
- Susan moved her hands away and the Doctor nodded.
- ! '''Nor me.'
- Eventually they had everyone unhooked, and it took the a minute to recover and to
  come back into clear thinking.
- Once the Doctor had reunited the two hundred missing people with their bewildered
  kin back on Gug's surface, he waited to see if any of them would falter.
- He had a style, that was something to know.
- He had to let them go, of course.
- ! '''Susan,'' he smiled as he stepped out of his own TARDIS and into the centre
  of the moon.'
- ! '''Doctor,'' she said, her head low.'
- ! '''Give you a job?'
- ! '''Well, in that case, you silly thing, you should know that I want you to take
  care of this place.'
- ! '''I...'
- ! '''Okay.'
- ! '''You''re not her, but you still have sentience.'''
- ! '''What did you do?'''
- ! '''For you.'
- ! '''You were showing signs of physicality earlier.'
- He smiled that heart-wrenching smile he did, where it pulled at his lips but sagged
  in his eyes.
- ! '''Of course it will.'
- ! '''Oh yeah, ''just don''t die'', nice little tidbit there Jaymse.'
- ! '''Just don''t die.'
- ! '''Well, this took a few tries to get right.'
- She gave Jaymse a hopeful smile before pressing the button and holding it down.
- A quick, blinding blue light shrouded her body and she smiled.
- Jaymse sat and watched, almost unimpressed, but his gaze gave him away.
- The person that emerged from the fading blue light no longer looked like Lussi.
- ! '''It worked!'''
- ! '''You always had it working,'' Jaymse said.'
- Jaymse sighed.
- ! '''You know what I mean.'
- ! '''Umm, I''m not sure there''s any that I''m in desperate need of...'
- ! '''But I want to know!'
- ! '''I''m not letting you turn into a Dalek.'
- ! '''No, I''m not.'
- She huffed.
- ! '''Yeah, well, that''s why we got out.'
- She smiled.
- She was only young, Lussi.
- Lussi pressed the button and held it.
- The blue light engulfed her and, when it revealed her, she was back in her original
  form.
- ! '''Yeah, we got away,'' Jaymse said.'
- ! '''You have a list of all of your favourite species.'
- ! '''Oh!'''
- Jaymse had a fleeting thought about whether they were going to have enough to sell
  come the Purchase Week.
- He and Lussi had a slightly...
- Lussi was brilliant, that's the core of it.
- This brilliance, along with Lussi's impressive technology, made it very easy for
  her to get into places they wouldn't usually be able to get within a thousand miles
  of.
- In return, these 'hunts' would most likely end with her coming into contact with
  a new species, and that was what she loved more than anything.
- Jaymse sometimes thought that it might just be a form of escape for her, but then
  again, she used to do it back when the Universe was awful and bloody.
- ! '''What''s next on the list?'''
- ! '''No!'
- ! '''Well, then there''s nothing!'
- ! '''Discover a species.'
- ! '''The Doctor?'
- ! '''But he was so...'
- ! '''He was life, too.'
- ! '''We''re okay now,'' Lussi said with a small grin.'
- The thick, steel door opened out onto the market, but it's usually-busy, bustling
  feel was dead.
- ! '''Where d''ya want to go?'''
- ! '''Roxmanop!'''
- ! '''Roxmanop, that''s a good hour-long journey.'
- ! '''Nope.'
- ! '''Judoon?'
- ! '''Maybe, but they won''t find me.'
- ! '''Old times, Lu.'
- ! '''Cataloging as many species as possible.'
- ! '''To take what you can.'
- ! '''Excellent.'
- ! '''Ahh, the scarlet beaches.'
- ! '''And they bring lots of people, too,'' Lussie chimed, happy.'
- They followed a familiar route to their ship, which Lussi had named 'The Horseman'.
- He clicked in a code and scanned in his eye and the side door popped open, allowing
  the two to step inside and close the door behind them.
- It was a good place to hunt.
- The issue was finding anything to pick.
- He pressed a few buttons and hit a few levers and they were soon off, powering upwards
  into the smog, then out of the clouds and into endless black, sprinkled with Starlight.
- On the way, Lussi tried a few forms that she'd done before, warming up to the newer
  ones.
- She knew, however, that there was a certain drawback to this kind of technology
  that she'd never want to edit out.
- As her body re-wrote itself, she found that the different surges of chemicals, brain
  size and capacity, body type and physiology all played a part in how she behaved
  as a person.
- ! '''Roxmanop!'''
- As they departed and locked the ship, Jaymse made a quick sweep of the area.
- A young, fox-like alien sat on his crossed legs, meditating in the sun atop a solid-crystal
  plinth.
- ! '''I think so...'''
- ! '''He thinks I''m a Plothrite thief who wants his chair.'
- ! '''Possibly,'' she thought, knowing she could.'
- ! '''A sweat sample from that Ylgrit''pl.'
- ! '''What?!'''
- Jaymse realised he was getting closer, and put on a smile, trying to remember what
  the traditional way to approach someone was on a tourist planet like this.
- ! '''Greetings!'''
- ! '''Hullo!'''
- ! '''May I shake your hand?'''
- ! '''Don''t have hands,'' Hawll laughed.'
- ! '''Must you?'''
- ! '''I must.'
- ! '''Earth?'''
- ! '''Haven''t been home in a while.'
- ! '''Well, in that case you can get away, not-such-an-Earthling.'
- Jaymse nodded, and walked behind Hawll before slowing.
- ! '''What was that?!'''
- He handed Lussi the flask.
- ! '''Already got it,'' she smiled, still in her Plothrite form.'
- ! '''Where''d he go?'''
- ! '''He''s waiting somewhere.'
- ! '''Anything.'
- Jaymse smiled.
- ! '''Never mind.'
- ! '''Because I told him I would.'''
- Lussi and Jaymse giggled like idiots as they climbed onto The Horseman, and set
  off without a second thought to the poor Fox.
- Lussi, happy from the day's success, was playing with becoming a Ylgrit'pl, much
  to Jaymse's annoyance.
- Even so, he was distracted.
- Hours later, they touched down.
- Anyway, he'd just sneak off in the night, Lussi's a heavy sleeper, so it shouldn't
  be too hard, or at least it wouldn't.
- If he was following them, or even looking for them, it'd be a hard job staying hidden.
- Maybe that was enough.
- Maybe it was just someone who'd heard Hawll yelling and wanted to know what was
  going on.
- Jaymse lay back in his comfy chair, the one he didn't let Lussi anywhere near.
- He set an alarm to get him up in the depth of night so he could go and recuperate,
  away from Lussi.
- Hopefully, he wouldn't be hearing a knock at the curtain.
- It was the middle the night.
- He stood, shaking off his short-lived sleep.
- Jaymse headed out into the empty skeleton of the Market.
- Making his way towards the docks, Jaymse noticed a tent with a light slipping out
  from between slightly ajar curtains to his left.
- Moving quietly towards the tent, he stuck to the shadows, letting the darkness enthral
  him.
- Jaymse flattened himself against the floor, peaking under the curtain to se inside
  - it was modern.
- Jaymse knew him, he realised.
- He stayed to the floor, knowing that the light being on gave him a masive disadvantage,
  but it also gave him the easy knowledge of knowing there was someone inside.
- Although, the light being on also could mean there was someone else about.
- Jaymse knew that the instand the second person walked through.
- Now, Jaymse had often done this with people with families.
- He moved back and, with a spinning head, stood up.
- ! '''I need...'''
- On his knees, he looked back into the tent with the man and his daughter.
- ! '''I need to,'' Jaymse told himself.'
- Crawling in, he cursed himself.
- It was heartless.
- Or he could be a killer.
- He had to fight for her.
- Jaymse took the man he couldn't remember's hand and squeezed.
- Suddenly his heart was pounding.
- All of these thing impacted his eyes so fast he didn't have time to think.
- A man was there.
- Eventually Jaymse gathered the ability to sit up and think.
- He looked to where the man had been, but now it was simply his shell.
- He shot up, buzzing.
- He darted to the curtain and threw it back, looking up to the moon.
- Often the nightmares happen when he took a little too much.
- He looked to the vial on the side, filled with the poison he'd dreamt of.
- Of course it wouldn't, he was full of life.
- Thoughts bounced around Jaymse's head, confusing him, spurring him and spinning
  him.
- ! '''I''m sorry!'''
- ! '''I...'
- ! '''I''m sorry!'
- ! '''But you''re still here?'
- ! '''I...'
- ! '''Lussi,'' Jaymse sat at the end of her bed and patted her foot.'
- ! '''Well, I need you to trust me.'
- ! '''What?!'
- ! '''But you promised!'
- ! '''I like it here.'
- ! '''...No.'
- Lussi stared at him blankly for a moment.
- ! '''What do you remember?'
- ! '''You and the others...'
- ! '''I did.'
- ! '''Yeah, the Doctor.'
- ! '''No, I don''t.'
- Lussi looked like she was going to panic.
- ! '''I...'''
- ! '''It looks...'
- ! '''A huge bubble.'
- ! '''That''s home, Lussi.'
- ! '''Gallifrey.'
- ! '''I take offence to that,'' she said.'
- ! '''Oh.'
- ! '''It''s gone, though.'
- ! '''Yeah...'
- ! '''The Doctor.'
- ! '''Maybe.'
- ! '''The Horsemen.'
- ! '''The Horsemen, that''s right.'
- ! '''I was.'
- She paused for a minute, eyes closed, going through these new memories that were
  cracked and over-exposed.
- ! '''And the Master...'
- ! '''And the Doctor, do you remember who he was?'
- ! '''Death,'' she said.'
- I knew nothing about myself...
- But there must have been a reason that I was like this?
- I will be posting more over the next few days, and I am also working on a trailer..
- Olivia frowned in wonder at the letter.
- Olivia climbed off the bus and looked around the desert she found herself in.
- Olivia grinned before shoving herself to her tiptoes so that her lips connected
  with his and he pulled her closer, deepening the kiss.
- She smiled when he entwined their fingers in front of her, his chin dipping down
  into her hair to press soft kisses to her neck.
- Rory suddenly stirred, looking to the hill behind them and directing everyone's
  gaze to the van that had stopped there.
- They all gathered around him, Olivia landing in the sand near his head as Amy slid
  next to her and River pulled out her handheld to scan him.
- Olivia stared at the flames that engulfed the boat with the Doctor's body aboard,
  tears still streaming down her face.
- The door at the back of the diner with Elvis painted on it opened, catching everyone's
  attention and they all stared in shock and disbelief at who stepped through the
  door.
- He braced himself by stiffening and shutting his eyes, tightly but when the blow
  never came he opened one eye to peek at her.
- His question was cut off when Olivia grabbed his head and pulled him onto her lips,
  wrapping her arms around his neck to pull him closer, her kiss desperate, making
  sure he was, in fact, real.
- ! 'A/N: So, i didn''t want Olivia to slap the Doctor like River even tho she probably
  would be pissed, but she''s more happy to see him alive more than angry.'
- The Doctor looked to Olivia as she leaned on one side of the console.
- He stepped away and the smiles instantly fell from their faces as Olivia headed
  toward River to hug her tightly.
- Both women watched him step back before Amy opened the door to the outer room of
  the bathroom, letting Olivia in, who in turn opened the door leading into the main
  room with the stalls.
- Amy screamed as Olivia took a step ahead of her to protect her if necessary, the
  blonde woman seizing as electricity ran through her.
- Olivia frowned in wonder as her stomach roiled.
- Everyone's gazes shot up at the sound of the little girl calling for help, and Canton
  drew his gun, cocking it.
- Amy suddenly doubled over in pain as Canton rushed past the Doctor, Olivia on his
  heels.
- The three remained silent as the Doctor and Olivia stared huge eyes of disbelief
  at Amy before they caught the sound of slow footsteps heading toward them.
- Olivia panted as she ran down an alley in Hollywood, California.
- She jumped when a gunshot rang out, her eyes shooting wide to stare at the Doctor,
  blankly.
- He stared at her evenly, then noticed her lower lip quiver.
- She didn't wait for his response before she turned and marched up the stairs, around
  the console as River and Rory stared at her, and up the stairs leading deeper into
  the TARDIS.
- The Doctor turned to head into the ship, Olivia right behind him.
- Amy and Rory said goodbye next before the Doctor opened the TARDIS door to let River
  step out and toward her cell in the Storm Cage.
- She told him everything that had happened at the lakeside.
- The Doctor pulled Olivia up the stairs leading to the deck, but the hatch was covered
  by heavy wood.
- One of the men came out of nowhere and used a long staff to try hitting the girls
  but they both stepped back and used their swords on their attackers as another man
  came up to fight them.
- All eyes shot to her as she looked to her hand and yanked out a huge splinter that
  made her hand bleed.
- They all saw a circle of green light coming from the water as the Siren's song continued.
- He pulled away from their grasp and touched the Siren, disappearing into a plume
  of smoke as the earlier sailor had.
- Avery suddenly heard coughing and opened one of the barrels to look inside where
  the noise was coming from.
- They all jumped when they heard a shriek come from a corner and whirled around to
  see that Toby had pulled the lid off one of the water barrels and the Siren's hand
  reached out, her song instantly starting.
- The first mate shuddered before finally lowering his gun to barricade the door again
  and Olivia took the sword from Toby's hand and tossed it away before tousling his
  hair.
- She could only nod as she watched Toby pull the medallion from around his neck to
  examine it.
- They all jumped up and Amy, Rory and Olivia hurriedly moved the barricade from the
  door, letting the Doctor run in and straight for Toby.
- Olivia was shoved against the railing on one side but couldn't help but laugh as
  she looked to the helm to the Doctor manning the ship as Avery worked on the rigging.
- Toby came back on deck with Avery's coat, but as he struggled with it, something
  fell from it with a clang.
- Olivia groaned as she awoke, rolling onto her back and rubbing her head as she opened
  her eyes.
- She frowned in wonder as he lifted the lid on the barrel of water, releasing the
  Siren and he spoke to her before she dove into the water.
- His gaze fell on her and without a word the Doctor clamped his hand down on the
  nape of Olivia's neck and pulled her toward him, her lips crashing onto his and
  sending her eyes wide in surprise.
- He stopped at a door and opened it only to jump back as it revealed an alien skeleton.
- The Doctor headed toward the door again, wiping his hand on Amy's coat as he passed
  her before the three followed him through another door where they heard monitors
  beeping around them.
- Olivia ran around the table to grab the Doctor's hand and pull him behind one of
  the tarps in the room, Amy and Avery quickly following.
- The Doctor and Olivia ran to one side, as Amy remained where she was, watching in
  fright.
- Olivia gave a muffled shout before he pinched her nose and tossed the handkerchief
  to the ground where the Siren shot at it with the fire in her hands, setting it
  aflame.
- Amy hesitantly placed her hand in the ring of light before the Siren disappeared,
  and they worked to unhook him from the machine.
- The three glanced at each other before nodding and the Doctor unstrapped him from
  the table, making him shout in pain as he gagged, unable to breathe.
- After a moment, Rory coughed and inhaled deeply before coughing again and when he
  recovered he hugged her tightly.
- He was cut off when there was a knock at the door.
- The Doctor reached for the floating white box in front of them but it whizzed past
  them then flew around the room.
- The Doctor clicked the ball together after fixing it and it glowed green, launching
  indistinct voices into the air.
- She gave a sigh before closing her eyes and doing as he told her, she heard indistinct
  voices, but recognized them from what she'd heard from Nephew Ood's translator,
  and they were softer now.
- ! 'A/N: i think Olivia handled that pretty well, don''t you?'
- Idris stepped back from the door gracefully as the Doctor stared at her for a moment
  before pulling out his Sonic, but he didn't aim it at the door like she said he
  would.
- The Doctor jumped at Olivia's command and used the Sonic on the door which swung
  open and Idris stepped out, stopping in front of the Doctor and studying him as
  he studied her.
- Olivia obeyed and worked alongside Idris who had her do as little as possible since
  she still looked as pale as a ghost.
- Olivia couldn't help smiling as she pressed a kiss to his cheek.
- He yanked on the coat hanger now hanging on a hook in the console and the red engine
  in the cylinder glowed red but didn't launch.
- ! 'A/N: no, lovelies, no!'
- Olivia did as he told her, both ignoring Idris speaking into the mirror again, giving
  Rory the passkey.
- They were thrashed around again before the console halted, sending them all to the
  floor and as the smoke cleared, Olivia gasped and coughed at the sight of the room
  they'd landed in.
- They all gasped when their bodies instantly became heavier, sending them all to
  the ground with painful grunts each.
- As the Doctor spoke, Idris' body arched, her mouth opening to release golden, huon
  particles that began flying around the room.
- House shouted in agony as the green lights in the TARDIS faded, something shone
  behind the Doctor as he leaned on the console.
- The lights came back on as Amy and Rory held onto each other and Olivia looked to
  the Doctor as he sniffled, turning to the console and still holding her hand.
- The Doctor frowned at her back as she changed into pajamas made of silk, shorts
  and a matching tank top.
- ! 'A/N: for the record...bunk bed ARE cool.'
- Olivia danced around the console to Muse's Supermassive Black Hole as the Doctor
  stood staring at the scanner, Amy and Rory near the TARDIS door, playing darts.
- The Doctor opened his mouth to reply, but an alarm blared instead, making all of
  them glance around in wonder before the TARDIS thrashed.
- Amy plopped into the jump seat, throwing her arms over her head, Rory dove to the
  floor, doing the same and the Doctor shoved Olivia against the console to plant
  his lips to hers.
- Olivia cautiously stepped toward the tub at the base of the vat of Flesh, pulling
  the Doctor with her by the hand.
- He marched out of the room, Olivia, Amy and Rory heading after him as the alarm
  blared again.
- He shot off, leaving a confused Amy and Rory behind in the monitoring station as
  Olivia ran off after him.
- She shoved him toward the weather vane, sending him into an instant run toward the
  door leading to its ladder.
- ! 'A/N: Liv needed a clever moment.'
- The voice was familiar, but sounded so far away, like a faint whisper.
- She didn't notice his stare as she quickly caught up with them, following them to
  the washroom where Jennifer stepped toward the sinks and Rory stopped in the doorway.
- Jennifer suddenly made a choked noise and Olivia looked up in time to see her puke
  something into the sink then look to her reflection in horror.
- They both turned to the door in time for Rory to receive a punch to the face that
  sent him to the floor before the hand instantly grabbed Olivia by the neck and shoved
  her against the mirror, making it crack under the force of her head hitting it.
- She watched Rory run out of the room and quickly pretended to be passed out, letting
  herself go limp just as the bathroom stall opened and Jennifer staggered out, her
  face flat and white.
- A lot.
- He gave a small smile before leaning down to press a tender kiss to her lips then
  gripping her hand and pulling her down the hall.
- They stopped when they looked to the shoes next to them, then followed the legs
  attached to them to see the Gangers of the crew, except Jennifer.
- Olivia looked around then ran toward a pair of shoes she found that matched the
  crew's boots.
- Rory shot down the hall to his right as the Gangers continued toward the doorway
  where the three were standing.
- Once he opened it the crew piled in, Amy hurrying in as well as Olivia pulled Ganger
  Doctor by the hand into it, followed by the Doctor and Cleaves.
- Ganger Doctor held Olivia by her arms to follow with the group, everyone still coughing
  until they reached a set of stairs and struggled up to the door at the top.
- ! 'A/N: i think Olivia would toally enjoy having two Doctors around, as demonstrated,
  and she would treat them both equally, so everything still hangs on Amy as before.'
- Amy glared at him before turning to look at Olivia who still paced behind the panel.
- Olivia nodded before stepping toward Ganger Doctor as he watched her approach.
- Buzzer watched her sit herself near the Doctor's head to look him over before heading
  back toward the door they'd come out of.
- Ganger Cleaves went one direction as Ganger Jimmy and Ganger Dicken dragged Olivia
  with them in another direction, Ganger Doctor marching ahead toward the dining hall.
- The ground suddenly shook, making everyone stumble and Rory tried to make a run
  for the door, but Olivia pulled on his sleeve.
- They all looked to the door when they saw movement, Ganger Jimmy coming back in
  and heading straight for the hologram, followed by the others.
- ! 'A/N: Olivia and Amy fighting...if we let that go on that could get really bad,
  lol!'
- They all raced down the halls as the alarm blared, the Doctors holding a hand each
  on Olivia as they dragged her ahead of everyone, but when they made a turn they
  stopped dead at seeing Jennifer standing at the end of it.
- Olivia hugged the Doctor's arm as they watched Jimmy greet his son, holding two
  red balloons they'd given him.
- Olivia frowned at him in wonder but she had no time to question him before they'd
  reached the TARDIS and they soon landed in the Morpeth Jetsan building.
- Olivia frowned in thought before realization hit her and she stared up at the Doctor
  in horror.
- Olivia gripped Rory's arm tightly as the Doctor pulled out his Sonic Screwdriver
  and aimed it at Amy.
- Olivia giggled before the TARDIS came to a halt and he went to the scanner to punch
  in the coordinates for the next place.
- Rory opened the door for her and they stepped out into the hall of the Storm Cage,
  heading toward her cell.
- Olivia swallowed and nodded before patting River's hand and turning to head after
  Rory.
- He flipped his hood back over his head just as the lights went out and the room
  was thrown into darkness.
- It was too late.
- He glanced to Olivia with a smile as she stared at him with wide eyes.
- Olivia and Rory looked to each other before looking to the Doctor as he stood at
  the window, Olivia swallowing as her stomach turned with anticipation.
- The Doctor and Olivia led the way as Vastra headed back to the control room.
- It finally opened and he ran into the room, Olivia running after him, but they both
  stopped to stare around the room.
- Olivia ran to Amy where she sat with Jenny who was comforting her, sitting on the
  other side of her to hug her shoulders as Amy stared into space, tears in her eyes.
- He nodded and held a hand toward Olivia, making her glance up at him sadly before
  taking his hand to let him pull her to her feet and toward Lorna who was lying against
  a set of stairs.
- Olivia frowned and looked to the cot, following the Doctor's gaze inside it to see
  the prayer leaf Lorna had given Amy for her daughter.
- Olivia sighed as she shoved her phone back into the pocket of her black skinny jeans
  as it vibrated from an incoming call.
- ! 'A/N: yes, i''m building towards them having a kid...but i think you already knew
  that.'
- The Doctor grabbed the newspaper and examined it as he stepped around the circle
  before finding the spot where the line would stop.
- Amy and Rory were sent to the ground as the Doctor and Olivia tried to stumble away,
  but the car drifted, making the backend hit the Doctor, sending him to the ground
  as Olivia screamed, backing toward the TARDIS until her back hit a corner.
- Olivia and the Doctor looked to Amy and Rory at the same time for an explanation
  as Mels leaned back on the TARDIS next to Olivia, still struggling to free herself.
- She threw her head back as her arms shot to either side of her and she screamed
  in pain as energy burst through her.
- She reached forward and grabbed the gun from the bowl on the desk and aimed it at
  him, pulling the trigger.
- Olivia growled in pain as she rolled to her side after landing on her feet on the
  ground below the awning she and River had jumped down from.
- River shoved Olivia to the ground, making her grunt as she landed and she threw
  her hands over her head when she heard gunfire in their direction.
- They drove until River finally tapped Olivia's shoulder and they came to a stop
  in front of an official looking building.
- To Olivia's utter astonishment, everyone began obeying and soon they hurried out
  of the room in a panic.
- River remained silent as she tried something else on, keeping her gaze on the mirror.
- Olivia frowned as River gently moved her away to look at herself in the mirror again,
  lifting something from her pile of clothes to try it on.
- Amy stepped behind the mirror to shove it aside and opened her mouth wide, sending
  a bright light at River.
- She and River went back to operating the TARDIS and a moment later Olivia was marching
  toward the door, signaling Amy and Rory to head out, River following them.
- Her smile fell when she looked down at him to find his eyes closed and Olivia couldn't
  hold back her sobs anymore as she leaned on Amy's shoulder, Rory's arms wrapped
  around Amy's waist.
- Olivia's lower lip quivered slightly before she threw her arms around him and pulled
  him close as he wrapped his arms around her in return.
- ! 'A/N: and right about now you should be asking, what the hell is up with Liv?'
- The Doctor watched Olivia closely as she came down the stairs with two mugs of tea
  in her hands for Amy and Rory, handing them to the couple with a smile.
- Olivia turned back to the console and reached for the scanner but before she could
  pull it closer she cried out in pain.
- He pulled Olivia with him, heading toward the window where they'd seen the little
  boy and knocked on the door.
- She tapped his nose with a smile, expecting him to give a childish giggle, but he
  only stared at her, making her smile fall as the Doctor stepped into the room, lifting
  a Rubix cube from the table next to the door and examine it.
- Olivia stepped toward George to sit with him on the bed, placing a comforting hand
  on his shin as they all watched the Doctor step to the cupboard.
- Olivia frowned at George when he leaned forward to see out of his door, hearing
  the landlord speaking with Alex.
- Alex looked to Olivia who only shrugged and shook her head to tell him she didn't
  know, and Alex followed the Doctor out of the room.
- Alex, Olivia and the Doctor stood in front of the cupboard in George's room as George
  stood next to his dad.
- Olivia laughed as Alex lifted George and set him on the counter, the Doctor following
  with a bag of kippers.
- Olivia lay on her back in the bottom bunk of hers and the Doctor's room, staring
  at the frame of the top bunk where the Doctor was lying.
- She smiled as he climbed down the ladder, scooting over to let him in the bed and
  he pulled her into his arms, letting her snuggle against him.
- Nothing.
- Amy stepped toward the door opposite the way they'd gone in and pressed the Check-in
  button, but Olivia stepped toward the glass floating in the air where the Doctor
  held it on his end.
- Amy and Olivia walked through the facility until they reached a lobby, everything
  sterile and pristine.
- Amy and Olivia climbed over the low wall next to the bin and into a hallway with
  stairs as an alarm blared.
- They watched the Handbots disappear completely before chancing to head out of the
  vent they were hiding in.
- Amy nodded and Olivia pressed the button again, and the door next to them shifted
  until it stilled and the girls ran through the door.
- Amy gasped when she turned to see a Handbot coming toward Olivia then turned to
  see another Handbot coming toward herself.
- She glanced around to be sure the Handbots didn't come after them as she used a
  red pen to write 'Doctor, we're waiting' and an arrow pointing at the handle of
  the door.
- ! 'A/N: i was struggling with myself to figure out if i should put Olivia and Amy
  together or have her help Rory and the Doctor find Amy...i chose this route.'
- Olivia and Amy spun around to see two Handbots coming toward them and Olivia ran
  between them to make them face each other, making their hands touch.
- She stopped to lift the glasses she found from the floor and handed them to Rory.
- Rory threw the rest of the levers and soon past Amy and past Olivia materialized
  in front of future Amy and future Olivia.
- They were nearly to the TARDIS when one of the Handbots surprised Amy Two and touched
  her neck, sending her to the floor, unconscious.
- Amy frowned before looking up at the Doctor who was staring at them, and she could
  see the look in his eyes.
- Just as quickly as he'd grabbed her, he released her when Rory stepped toward the
  console.
- The Doctor stood and stepped toward Olivia to take her hand and pull her toward
  a set of stairs leading down, but stopped when he heard Amy stir and looked to her
  just as she looked at him, Rory standing to sit with her.
- His hands came up to grab her face and pull her lips onto his.
- Olivia frowned when she stepped out of the TARDIS door and into a 1980s style hallway
  in a 1980s style hotel…or at least what looked like one.
- ! 'A/N: so, i''ve pretty much kept true to the episodes...but this episode is gonna
  get a different ending.'
- Olivia stared huge eyes at all the ventriloquist dummies sitting in every chair
  of the dining room.
- The group stayed together as they made their way around the hotel.
- She pressed herself against the door to peek through the peep hole and made a face
  when she saw a Minotaur stalk by and sighed in relief when it didn't stop at her
  door.
- This must have been what the TARDIS meant when she was stuck in Idris' body.
- Taking a deep, calming breath she finally lifted her head and felt around the door
  for a light switch.
- She stood and headed toward the Doctor as he and Rita still spoke.
- The Doctor chuckled as Olivia stepped away, making him look to her in wonder as
  she stepped toward the bar.
- She sighed in thought before biting her lower lip and looking up at him, tears coming
  to her eyes.
- And for the first time in a long time, she really did believe they could get through
  it.
- Everyone started speaking at once, making Olivia pull out her Sonic Screwdriver
  then take the Doctor's as well and place them tip to tip, pressing the buttons and
  the sound that came from them was deafening.
- Olivia stared wide eyes at the thing moving around the room.
- The glass shattered and the Doctor moved to cover Olivia from the glass flying around
  them as she screamed and threw her hands over her head.
- He grabbed her hand and dragged her down the hall, and when they rounded a corner
  they saw Howie curled up next to the wall on the other end of the hallway.
- He cut her off when he planted his lips to hers, slipping his arms around her to
  hold her close, putting everything he could into the kiss.
- The Doctor looked to the screens then grabbed the receiver of the phone in front
  of him and dialed the room number that he could see closest to Rita.
- Rita hung up the phone and the four watched as she pushed the phone away and stood
  to face the hall.
- They met with Gibbis in the kitchen, Amy and Rory sitting at a table against the
  wall, Gibbis sitting at another table with Olivia at the bar as the Doctor shouted
  angrily, marching around the room to break things in rage.
- ! 'A/N: Big reveal, next chappie!'
- The Doctor, Amy, Rory, Gibbis and Olivia all ran down one of the halls of the hotel
  as it shuddered around them from the Minotaur's footsteps as it ran after them.
- The Doctor grabbed Olivia by both arms and pulled her in, the rest following them
  into room number 10.
- A regeneration was in progress.
- In that moment, though he knew exactly what he had to do, he second guessed himself.
- The Minotaur roared before stumbling out of the room, catching the Doctor's attention
  and he stepped toward the door to watch it as Amy and Rory hurried toward Olivia.
- She shook her head again, refusing to hear him before lowering her hands when she
  heard strange sounds then looked down at the new floor.
- She said nothing as she stood, keeping her gaze away from him as she turned to head
  into the TARDIS.
- Olivia lay on the bottom bunk of the beds in hers and the Doctor's room, her tears
  long dried onto her cheeks.
- The door opening to the room caught her ear and she turned to see if it was Amy
  or Rory or both.
- Olivia said nothing as she sat up and shifted to slip off the bed and stand to leave
  the room.
- He slipped her ring back on her finger then released her hand, letting her head
  out of the room before he could say anything more.
- Tears came to Amy's eyes as she pulled him close to hug him.
- He turned back to smile at her, making her laugh and wave before he finally stepped
  through the door and shut it behind him.
- The Doctor bowed his head with a pained sigh when he saw the image of the little
  girl with black curls on her head and bluer than blue eyes.
- Olivia swallowed and shuddered, but didn't move as he stepped up to stand on the
  same stair with her, taking her hands in his to turn her toward him.
- She choked on a sob then threw her arms around him, planting her lips to his for
  a long awaited, make-up kiss…all teeth and tongue and desperation to be forgiven.
- Olivia bounced to Beyonce's Single Ladies playing in the background as she moved
  around the kitchen, cooking and singing.
- The song changed to Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen making him laugh heartily
  before he started the ridiculous dance he'd done at Amy and Rory's wedding.
- Olivia giggled before gasping as they came to a stop, a dog stopping in front of
  them while crossing their path but when it looked up at them she frowned in confusion.
- Olivia shook her head in amusement before looking to the cart next to him and grinning
  when she saw what they were selling.
- When they reached the TARDIS and stepped inside, Olivia turned to him and pressed
  her lips to his, making him pull her closer by her shoulders.
- The Doctor watched her as he strolled up the steps to stand at the console, pulling
  the scanner toward him and flipping the screen on to see the image of one of the
  options his and Olivia's child would look like.
- Suddenly the thought of a child with Olivia seemed like a dream bound to remain
  a dream.
- Olivia giggled as she hurried down the steps as quickly as her heels would let her
  then threw her arms around him as he caught her, leaning back onto the edge of the
  console.
- He sighed again but nodded and she leaned closer, pressing her lips to his for a
  kiss to comfort both of them.
- The Doctor stared at her with wide eyes for a moment before he couldn't help the
  smirk that slid over his lips at her feistiness.
- She sighed in relief and couldn't help smiling as her mood slowly changed.
- She frowned when a knock came to her door, wondering who could be visiting so late
  in the evening.
- Jack cut himself off as he stopped on the middle step, wearing nothing but a pair
  of navy blue lounging pants.
- Joyce grabbed Aaron's hand, pulled him around to Jack's right and set it on the
  towel she was using to absorb the blood from his nose as Jack still leaned his head
  back.
- Aaron pulled out his cell phone and snapped a picture of Olivia and the Doctor as
  she leaned over his hand, lightly dabbing the ice filled dish towel onto his knuckles.
- The Doctor gave her a small frown but she smiled reassuringly before he nodded then
  glared at Jack a moment as he turned to head toward the door.
- ! 'A/N: last time they went to Barcelona they didn''t see the dogs with no noses,
  so I added one in there.'
- The baby stopped crying as he stared at the Doctor who leaned back and went back
  to examining a magazine he'd started.
- A muscle twitched in his jaw when he clenched it, pulling back to stare into her
  eyes.
- They both frowned at her and shook their heads before she looked to the Doctor with
  a shrug.
- The Doctor grabbed Olivia's hand and dragged her away, Craig wheeling Alfie after
  them.
- They stared across the isle at Amy and Rory as a little girl with a bowtie hair
  band stopped the couple, asking for her autograph.
- The paneling came down on the nose to reveal jagged teeth, making them all gasp.
- They ran down a set of stairs leading to the circuit breakers.
- Olivia screamed as she stared up at the Cyberman that had knocked out the Doctor
  as it turned to her.
- Olivia watched the Doctor as he mixed something up in a bowl at Craig's dining room
  table in the kitchen.
- When he didn't reply she sighed and looked to the table littered with all kinds
  of things before succumbing to her curiosity.
- She felt tears come to her eyes at the thought of it.
- Olivia felt her heart ache watching the baby start to fuss again, rubbing his eyes,
  tiredly as the Doctor bounced him only slightly in his arms.
- He turned his head enough to press a kiss to Alfie's head and Olivia stood when
  he glanced her way, finally noticing her.
- The Doctor watched her as she lifted Alfie's hand and left noisy kisses to it, making
  him give his baby laugh and she giggled, and the Doctor was unable to keep from
  smiling, even as his hearts ached.
- The Doctor ran at the door and it shattered as he dove through it, Olivia turning
  her back to protect Alfie in case any shards of glass were sent their way.
- Craig groaned in pain as the Cybermat skidded across the floor before it recovered
  and launched itself at the Doctor.
- Olivia fiddled with one of the dials on the console in thought, almost not noticing
  the Doctor step inside, if the TARDIS hadn't hummed in warning, alerting her to
  his presence.
- The Doctor sat on the sofa, a magnifying monocle in his eye as he used a regular
  screwdriver on the Cybermat.
- He trailed off when he turned to Craig only to find him sleeping with Alfie lying
  on top of him, asleep as well.
- They stepped inside the mall and the Doctor tucked the Cybermat away in his coat
  before pulling out his Sonic and looking around for trouble, gripping Olivia's hand
  to drag her through the shops.
- He was looking at Val, making Olivia roll her eyes and shake her head at him.
- Olivia growled before pulling out her Sonic and following him through the tunnel.
- They snuck in, hearing voices, and cautiously came to a corner.
- Craig's helmet split open as the Doctor laughed and Craig called for Alfie, pulling
  himself free of the machine.
- She peeked behind to see if he was distracted long enough to duck behind a rack
  of clothes, hidden behind a column.
- It was finally hitting her.
- She sniffled, glancing at the hat on his head as tears streamed down her face before
  she finally confessed.
- The Doctor sighed in understanding as he pulled her closer when her shoulders started
  to shudder with sobs.
- He tipped his hat before turning to head back to the TARDIS, Olivia in tow.
- Olivia paced around and around the console, waiting for the Doctor's return.
- She followed his lead as they stepped out of the TARDIS and onto a dark, foggy dock.
- Without a word the Doctor slammed the Dalek eyestalk onto the counter in front of
  him, smirking at the man, knowingly.
- Olivia stared down at the Doctor sitting in the Live Chess arena with another envoy
  of the Silence.
- The Doctor used his Sonic on the box in front of him before opening it to reveal
  the blue head of Dorium Maldovar, who looked like he was sleeping.
- The Doctor looked to the floor, noticing something as Olivia struggled to free herself
  and he looked back up at them in panic.
- Olivia scrambled up as he pulled her toward him, and when she was out of the hole
  enough to crawl the rest of the way she cleared the door as the Doctor used his
  Sonic to shut it.
- Olivia sighed and turned to head out of the room, taking the flaming torch with
  her to light her way back to the TARDIS.
- Olivia lifted her head from his chest to look up at him, seeing his genuine shock
  as she felt his grip tighten on her.
- He trailed off making Olivia watch him closely before he looked at her and smiled,
  sadly, reaching into the pocket of his coat to pull out the stationary she'd taken
  from Craig's house.
- Olivia set the five envelopes and a small package in front of the Teselecta, still
  disguised as Gideon Vandaleur.
- She felt tears welling in her eyes again and shook her head before turning to step
  out the door to head back to the TARDIS.
- He leaned toward Olivia and she gave a squeak when the Doctor grabbed her around
  her waist to pull her against him, making her giggle when she landed.
- She smiled when he entwined their fingers in front of her, his chin dipping down
  into her hair to press soft kisses to her neck.
- Rory suddenly stirred, looking to the hill behind them and directing everyone's
  gaze to the van that had stopped there.
- He closed his eyes, hearing her struggle against the suit, then the sounds of the
  blasts that would kill him, jerking with each sound…but nothing happened.
- Olivia felt a prick of jealousy, knowing he wasn't talking about her and wishing
  it were so.
- His story resumed with the soothsayer taking the head from its place and into his
  ship and there was something about a question.
- Olivia was suddenly behind the Doctor and he had a weapon in his hands…but she didn't
  remember him pulling her behind him or retrieving the weapon, and her heart was
  racing, as if she was afraid.
- He adjusted the weapon in his hand…only to find that arm covered in marks, making
  Olivia stare at it in terror before they all heard the rattling hiss the creatures
  made.
- Something rolled toward them from out of nowhere on the floor, catching their attentions
  with its beeping, and instantly forgetting the Silence, the Doctor grabbed Olivia's
  hand to pull her away, guessing it was some sort of grenade.
- Before Olivia could stand to stop her, Amy pulled the trigger and blasted him in
  the head, making him jerk back onto the floor and Olivia turned to stare at his
  body in horror.
- The Doctor awoke to the sound of a radio, slight rocking, and the feeling of a cool
  cloth on his pounding head.
- He suddenly looked at the thing he was holding and realized it was a miniature of
  his TARDIS.
- The Doctor pulled her into a room where he shut the door and hung the clothes on
  the hook behind it, turning just in time to catch Olivia when she threw herself
  into his arms.
- On Dupug, in the shadow of a mountain range a wheezing sound and breeze began.
- Several billion kilometres away was a spaceship, on course to the world.
- The Doctor and Kafyip, after more than half an hour, reached the top.
- Guhi was standing in front of a locked door with his artificial hand smoking.
- Suddenly there was a cry from inside the room.
- There was a nasty crunch from behind as Guhi beat another Monk.
- A few minutes later the Police were questioning people.
- They crept out to the 2 Hover-Vehicles, jumping into one.
- On the top of the mountain 4 Officers ran into a vehicle which started following
  the men down.
- Soon the TARDIS was in orbit round the Green Moon.
- The spaceship glided down towards a mountain on the Green Moon.
- The Doctor examined the readings.
- The Doctor turned his sonic around.
- The cave left from the other side of the mountain.
- Kafyip and the Doctor turned to see Guhi and the Sycorax blocking the entrance.
- The Doctor took the box from one of the Sycorax and walked to the door.
- The spiders were crawling towards them, alerted by the sonic screwdriver.
- The Doctor desperately ran at the door and tried using his sonic screwdriver and
  own strength to push it back.
- A powerful suction began as the door started to slide shut.
- Once the TARDIS had been moved to a few metres outside the cave the Doctor took
  some canisters out of a locked fridge in a room on the left of the second level
  of the TARDIS.
- The Monastry was quiet.
- The remaining Sycorax staggered towards the ship.
- As the TARDIS whirled through the vortex the Doctor took the box up two floors,
  and came to a heavy metal door.
- This is my first poem, so please review and tell me what you think.
- I wrote this poem after reading someone elses poem.
- But he was an alien on an alien planet.
- The last thing he needed was to cripple this new body with alien poisons.
- Why hadn't he ever been this hungry before after a regeneration?
- He'd had to see everyone, one last time.
- Fortunately, they were all fine.
- He wasn't going to think about it.
- But isn't that what everyone did?
- It tore him up that he'd had to block all that she'd become, all that she'd learned
  since she'd met him.
- She was Donna, she'd find some unfortunate being taken advantage of, and she'd sail
  in like a galleon of war and obliterate the enemy.
- Please take a moment to leave a review.
- This is the first installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped into
  my head this morning.
- There, she'd said it.
- Oh God.
- She had been naive thinking things would never end.
- It was her curse too, though.
- This is the second installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped
  into my head yesterday.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- Rose sat cross-legged on the ledge of the bay window, staring at the Zeppelin filled
  sky.
- A soft knock sounded on her door.
- Rose rolled her eyes.
- Jackie was annoyed by this.
- There was a pause of awkward silence.
- Rose stiffened, turning to face her mother for the first time since she entered
  the room.
- Jackie crossed her arms.
- Rose frowned.
- What did Rose have to smile about?
- Jackie softened too, joining her daughter on the window seat.
- Rose nodded halfheartedly.
- This is the third installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped into
  my head yesterday.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- He shrugged.
- She rolled her eyes.
- Rose cracked a small smile, the first real smile she had allowed herself in weeks.
- This is the fourth installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped
  into my head a few days ago.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- Rose was just about to return home to her small flat downtown when she realized
  she left her mobile back in her locker.
- She's started as a secretary, learning the ins and outs of the entire corporation,
  until she decided she was ready to join the field operators.
- Rose had rolled her eyes.
- Rose had to admit, she did miss the adventure.
- Mickey smiled arrogantly.
- Rose shook her head, slightly annoyed but overall grateful for Mickey's thoughtfulness.
- Now, three years after that crushing day at Bad Wolf Bay, Rose was well-off.
- Rose smiled.
- Her field partner Roady appeared beside her, Rose's mobile in hand.
- That turned into a disaster.
- So when word got around that the director's daughter was soon to join the field
  operation's ranks, Roady took the chance and volunteered to help train her.
- The party guests laughed as Rose blushed and even darker shade.
- The crowd whooped and hollered as someone turned the rock and roll music up and
  the lights down low.
- Rose sighed.
- Rose laughed genuinely.
- She nodded.
- This is the fifth installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped into
  my head a few days ago.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- Rose couldn't believe what she had heard.
- Mitch took another swig of his drink.
- Rose wasn't listening.
- Pete was starting to get annoyed.
- Rose was slightly taken aback.
- Pete sighed.
- Rose felt terrible.
- Rose groaned.
- Pete knelt down in front of her, pulling her hands down so she could look at him.
- It took a while for those words to fully sink in.
- Wow!
- This is the sixth installment of a series of one shot stories that just popped into
  my head a few days ago.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- Dr.
- Not that Dr.
- Rose nodded, just as Jackie knew she would.
- Jackie accepted it.
- Rose knew her decision to use the dimension cannon to go back was hard on Roady.
- She held out her left arm, showing the small scar the fold of her elbow where the
  small tracking device had been injected.
- Pete stood, crossing to Dr.
- What do you guys and girls think?
- This is the seventh installment of some one shot stories that just popped into my
  head a few days ago.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- The phone rang, echoing throughout the quiet Tyler mansion.
- Pete reached for the night stand lamp and switched in on, picking up the phone in
  the process.
- Pete nodded.
- Pete was confuse.
- Just then, Rose came bustling through the doors, looking slightly disheveled in
  her track suit bottoms and hoodie pullover.
- Dr.
- Dun dun duuuuun.
- I've decided to combine them all in to one instead of posting them separately.
- Rose and Roady were sitting on a bench outside of Rose's apartment.
- Rose's heart sank.
- Tears stung her eyes as Rose recalled saying practically the same thing to him once.
- Roady felt like a thousand pound weight had been dropped on him.
- A little longer than I originally planned, but so worth reading.
- Roady sat alone at a lunch table in the Torchwood cafeteria, brooding into his cup
  of coffee.
- Figures, he thought sullenly.
- Jake shook his head.
- Jake laughed.
- Roady groaned and rubbed his hands down his scruffy face.
- Mickey scoffed.
- Roady groaned again.
- Mickey cleared his throat and scooted his chair closer to Roady's.
- Roady shook his head in disdain.
- He smiled warily and slapped Roady on the shoulder.
- He sighed.
- Yay for update!
- Also, I am currently in the long tedious process of moving.
- A little longer than I originally planned, but so worth reading.
- Rose nodded.
- This was it, Rose thought.
- Here we go.
- The room glowed that blinding blue and white light, as she was suddenly transported
  to a darkened street.
- That was her thread of hope.
- Her heart swelled with happiness.
- Rose stood in disbelief, a wave of nausea washing through her.
- The woman became defensive.
- Rose shook her head.
- Dr.
- Dr.
- Rose mentally high-fived herself.
- I already had this chapter typed and my cousin has a laptop.
- Planned to be about 25 chapters long.
- Rose ran out of the dark alleyway she had appeared in gasping for air.
- A flash of recognition shot over Donna's face.
- Rose nodded; glad she hadn't landed too far back.
- Donna, of course, noticed her staring.
- Rose frowned.
- Donna shrugged.
- Rose decided she had better get to the point.
- Donna looked annoyed.
- Donna rolled her eyes.
- Rose continued trying to convince her.
- I'm a time traveler from another dimension, Rose thought.
- Donna froze.
- Rose once again felt the tug of the dimension cannon as she was pulled across time
  and space, back to where this whole alternate reality began.
- Rose felt a flood of relief wash over her as she sighed.
- She knelt to the ground beside her.
- The world started to shimmer and fade away.
- EXTREMELY short chapter but I felt it needed to stand alone.
- Rose pulled on her purple jacket, found the biggest gun she could handle, grabbed
  her mobile out of her locker and headed back down to the cannon project room.
- Jackie scoffed again, rolling her eyes.
- Rose made her way to the platform, rolling her eyes again.
- Martha looked concerned, but did as she was told.
- Jackie nodded curtly.
- Martha nodded, slightly terrified of Jackie Tyler.
- It has always bothered me that Mickey didn't interact much with Rose in the Journey's
  end episode.
- She found the Noble family.
- Suddenly, the laptop came to life, and a voice sounded.
- Rose crossed to the laptop.
- The picture came into view, and a woman was shown.
- Harriet pushed a few buttons, and two more images appeared.
- Jack laughed happily.
- Rose frowned.
- The groups began transmitting, trying to boost a signal to the Doctor's TARDIS.
- Wilf stood.
- As Harriet's screen darkened, another image popped in its place.
- The Doctor had a huge grin plastered on his face.
- Rose pulled out the small handheld teleport device she had in her pocket, closed
  her eyes, and begged for a miracle.
- ! 'Rose opened her eyes to the most wonderful sight she could ever dream of: the
  TARDIS stood no more than a hundred feet away, along with a certain man in brown
  and silver pinstripes.'
- These next few chapters are gonna be recaps of the actual episode.
:midParagraphs:
- But any of you who have read my last story, thank you for sticking with me.
- He greeted enthusiastically.
- Eliza laughed slightly, tears beginning to form in her eyes.
- The man before her had big hair, sticking up slightly at the back, and was brown,
  as were his eyes.
- Rose looked him up and down before she started, slowly but surely, letting her grip
  relax.
- He exclaimed.
- he exclaimed giddily.
- He turned to the two women, only one of them smiling while the other stared at him
  blankly, not sure what to do or what to say.
- he asked, giving them a toothy grin, something he hardly ever did in his last body.
- he cheered.
- This made Eliza laugh, Rose still looking bemused.
- Yeah!
- She released Rose's remaining grip on her, making the older woman half-hide behind
  one of the TARDIS corals, as the young teenager walked foreword and circled him.
- he complained.
- Eliza nodded, then approached him, wrapping her arms around his waist, resting her
  head on his chest, feeling the double beat of his hearts.
- Rose stuttered, trying to register what she'd just seen.
- Her eyes then went from scared to determined.
- She walked up to him slowly, pushing him lightly.
- Rose bellowed.
- You ain't tricking me.
- I've seen all sorts of things.
- the Doctor attempted again.
- I was dying.
- The Doctor she'd gotten to know so well the past year?
- he asked.
- Just one word.
- he greeted softly.
- the Doctor asked, letting go of her hand and running around the TARDIS Console,
  flicking buttons as he went.
- Remember that time when we had to hop?
- Do you remember?
- the Doctor laughed at the memory, imitating it as he bounced up and down on the
  spot.
- All that hoping?
- Remember hoping for your life?
- the Doctor exclaimed.
- Eliza stayed unusually quiet for the majority of this exchange, watching as if she
  was at a tennis match.
- Change to London, the Powell Estate… let's say the 24th of December.
- He pressed a final button, stepping away from the Console.
- It's all waiting; fish and chips, sausage and mash, beans of toast- no, Christmas!
- he said happily, and then acquired a serious expression.
- he struggled.
- the Doctor doubled over in pain, holding his stomach.
- He quickly stood up straight, took a deep breath in and exhaled; flowing from his
  mouth was a long stream of yellow mist, the same that appeared when he was changing.
- the Doctor exclaimed as he bent over.
- At the height he was at, he looked just under the Console to see a familiar, but
  hardly used button.
- he replied aggressively.
- Oh, my beautiful ship, faster, that's a girl!
- the Doctor screamed.
- he stopped for just a moment, his voice calming.
- A moment later, an alarm bell started to ring.
- the Doctor replied excitedly.
- he exclaimed, jumping slightly.
- he looked at the pair of them intently as they hung onto the Console.
- They ended up at the Powell Estate, crashing into numerous buildings as they sped
  by.
- When they landed, Rose and Eliza ended up in a heap on the floor.
- Eliza asked herself, getting up a few moments after the Doctor went out the doors
  to greet Jackie and Mickey.
- Before she could stop herself, she fell out of the doors to see her guardian passed
  out on the floor, Rose next.
- Rose asked.
- But who is her?
- Jackie asked, looking down at the stranger.
- Quickly, she undressed and put her black leather coat on, strapping her weapons
  on her back.
- She needed to go somewhere, but first, she needed answers.
- Yes, she'd had her suspicions, but this proved it, and the signature was a spot
  on match.
- She'd written this letter, she'd dumped herself on the Doctor.
- Why?
- Maybe to bring forth the Cub?
- She could have done that easily without the Doctor's help.
- And why'd she take away her own memories?
- She kicked the door down, burst in and searched for the Photo Album.
- Flipping through the pages, she landed on the one of Jason, the Doctor and the dark
  skinned woman, all smiling at the camera.
- she bellowed.
- She sat back down on the bed, gripping her hair.
- One of the newly formed memories said something about the it.
- She unfolded it and re-read it, only coming upon new writing on the other side of
  the page, where the old-new writing was settled.
- She wanted answers; she was going to get them.
- Jackie said, opening the door, revealing the Doctor, fast asleep in the bed.
- she heard Rose's voice ask.
- At the name, Eliza brightened up as bit, walking into the room and seeing Rose's
  suspicion was correct.
- A few other scenes passed on the telly, Harriet talking about the new Space Probe
  that they were sending into space.
- The telly switched over, Eliza remembering the letter.
- Rose asked quickly.
- the voice called back.
- The dog began to whine as he scratched on the door.
- The door opened, revealing Jason, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt.
- She slipped off the boots and followed Jason through the house.
- They walked into the living room, a woman sat in a chair watching telly.
- She'd seen this woman before; in Jason's Photo Album.
- She was the woman who was holding the baby him.
- This was Jason's mother.
- Her life was a fairytale.
- She flew away with her magical Doctor and they never stopped running.
- It was all a girl could ever dream of.
- But there was something more.
- She had years of experience with that.
- And she needed someone she could rely on.
- Someone who would always be there for her.
- Rory.
- Her Rory.
- He was caring, brave, loyal, and kind, but most of all he would never leave her.
- He had waited for her for 2,000 years and she believed that he would wait 2,000
  more.
- He was her prince, a key part to her fairytale.
- The Doctor, Amy, and Rory.
- And not all of them have a happy ending.
- He was gone.
- And now she was staring at the cold stone face of what took him.
- And Amy knew.
- She knew that she would miss The Doctor terribly, but she knew that she would die
  if she were to live without Rory.
- She barely got to say goodbye to her daughter, just a kiss on the hand.
- But River understood.
- And then The Doctor.
- Both of their tears were coming down too fast.
- She told him what she had to do, and he tried to protest.
- The turned to him and said her final goodbye.
- And then she blinked.
- The Doctor crumpled at her grave, sobbing and mourning.
- But Amelia was happy.
- It was that time again where the power of the TARDIS needed to be replenished.
- That was how the Doctor ended up in the Welsh capital Cardiff.
- He had been here many a time, the most recent being a sassy red head named Donna
  Noble.
- The Doctor felt a sudden pang of sadness at his friend who no longer would know
  who he was.
- After all that they had been through, all of the people they saved together, she
  wouldn't remember a thing.
- The Doctor shook his head in attempt to clear it.
- He breathed in the salty sea air from the Bristol Channel and leant over the railings
  of the harbour.
- He thought back to the times he had been stood on that spot with his Rose.
- Beautiful Rose now trapped without him.
- Brilliant Sarah Jane Smith whom he dumped back on Earth.
- Guilt.
- Martha who had to let him go.
- Guilt.
- Sassy Donna who had to forget his existence.
- Guilt once again.
- Jack, now wrong and bound to immortality.
- Guilt.
- He had promised each one that he wouldn't leave them.
- Needless to say, the memories flooded back of his friends who he would never see
  again.
- Six hours of this God forsaken job with every other man staring at her like a piece
  of meat.
- And only five hours left.
- Excellent.
- She wiped her dishwater blonde hair from her sweaty forehead.
- Work at the docks wasn't all that it is cracked up to be.
- She didn't have much more time to ponder on this however as a rusty old banger of
  a boat came juttering to a stop near her feet.
- She groaned and reached for the boat with her rope calloused hands.
- They wrapped around the rope and pulled the boat with expert strength and tied it
  around the cleat.
- The woman on the boat shot her a grateful smile and hopped off with her husband.
- Alice shook her head when the woman's husband openly gawped at her when his wife's
  back was turned.
- It wasn't like she was the only dock worker in the world!
- She was quite pretty but nothing special.
- At least that is what she thought.
- She was small for her age of nineteen and her hair was shoulder length and spikey.
- she shouted back to them.
- This sent a round of crude laughter around their little gang.
- She lived about half a mile away from the docks and often enjoyed her runs.
- It gave her time to contemplate the origins of the universe.
- She groaned and propelled the wailing object at her wall and stared at the spot
  where it had hit every single morning for 14 years.
- The paint was well and truly demolished and the wall was beyond repair.
- How the clock was still working was a mystery pondered by Gods.
- Maybe it's just persistent to make my life a misery?
- Alice started to get ready for just a normal day at the docks.
- He'd been demonstrably ahead and now he was losing ground.
- he snapped out with a frown.
- It was another TARDIS and he blinked in surprise at the screen.
- He could feel the faint Song of his people, but it was too dim and too far away
  for him to make out the details.
- Where had his other self gotten such a thing?
- Still, it was probably not heavily armed, which was a benefit.
- That was the real question.
- Would the other him risk bringing her near to another version of himself?
- He nearly laughed aloud at the thought.
- As if it would matter, why would she care about him, the cut-rate version of the
  one she had?
- She's take one look at him, the one that had failed, the one that had killed her,
  and she'd turn away in disgust.
- He was clearly more talented at it than the Master was himself.
- He would never harm Susan, but he had no choice but to lose them.
- She mustn't be in the blast radius when he fired up the Lens.
- There had to be a way to discourage them from following.
- And it was rearranging itself.
- It was forming itself into a series of overlapping circles that formed a geometric
  shape that looked rather like a flower.
- It was the Lens.
- It wasn't being used, wasn't powering up, it was just...
- She smiled at him.
- He examined the tools and bits with interest, but without much understanding.
- He had seen them all over the ship.
- She tapped it, and a square of light appeared, projected images scrolling across
  it.
- Aislynn tapped the half sphere, quietly uploading the file that Dar had given her,
  with all of the medical data on the Nanites.
- It would be available for him, if he wanted to look at it.
- Susan crowed.
- Susan teased, since she was piloting in her jim-jams, her hair in a braid at the
  back of her head and her feet in slippers.
- The north wall of the console room seemed to pull away from the south wall.
- It was as if the room was a rubber band, stretching out farther and farther, becoming
  impossibly long.
- All over the ship the same phenomenon occurred.
- The longer the room became, the more tension soaked into the atmosphere, leaving
  their ears protesting, as the air pressure changed.
- It was a grinding moment of wrong, leaving everyone on board clenching their teeth.
- Susan gasped out, shocked to her core.
- Had the Master actually dropped mines behind him?
- he shouted.
- For Dr.
- Aislynn nodded.
- She would have time to collect her thoughts, which was good.
- It was hardly the best solution, but it was the only one he had.
- Susan asked.
- He slowed the TARDIS, Susan and Rose following him, waiting for his orders.
- He looked out over the mines and thought.
- The Master had changed the codes, of course, and it took him precious seconds to
  work out his alterations and send the correct sequence.
- What the hell was his other self doing?
- He could have seriously injured Susan, which couldn't have been his intention.
- Whatever else he thought about his alternate universe self, he could not imagine
  that he'd ever intentionally harm her.
- Even at his craziest, the very thought of hurting her had made him feel ill.
- He was almost afraid to do so, to stick his hand into the blender of the other man's
  pain again, but just then he had no choice.
- /What the hell do you think you're doing?
- It had made him who he was.
- Whoever he might have been, before Rassilon had gone in and rewired him, that potential
  self had been warped, twisted, and changed.
- For all his gentle kindness, his loving nature, the ruthless practicality of the
  Master still lived in him.
- He had chosen to use it to serve his loved ones, these days.
- He was baffled by why the other him was going in the exact opposite direction from
  where he ought to be.
- The entire purpose for you being this way is gone and dead!
- So, what's the bloody point?
- /What are you doing?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He could not fathom what had gotten into his other self.
- That wanker had everything, everything, that anyone could ever ask for.
- He certainly had everything that the Master most desperately wanted.
- What was he going on about, girls?
- What girls?
- /Go.
- Just go.
- Get Susan out of the blast radius and...
- just… live./ He hung up.
- Koschei gasped, understanding washing through him.
- he asked.
- It raises the damage output by several orders of magnitude, if I'm recalling it
  correctly, especially if fired from within a TARDIS.
- The disadvantage is that it can only be fired at point-blank range.
- You'd lose the TARDIS as well as its pilot.
- Why?
- That's what he must have been doing earlier; he was breaking them off, so they were
  clustered by themselves.
- Why would he do that?
- If he wants to kill himself, fine, but why do all this?
- he asked, running a spectral analysis on the bubbles.
- The first streams of information started to come in and he frowned.
- What is that?
- In fact, two weeks of a steady diet could make a person really start to dislike
  crab in general.
- They had another week to go before the next bridge appeared and Jake was trying
  to figure out how to entertain five Mashas and keep them from worrying too much.
- Madison wasn't that hard, she was tough, no-nonsense, and direct.
- Give her an objective and she'd take it, no questions asked.
- London and Kayla though, they were thinkers and that meant more work for him.
- They'd all been cloned from her and she was a Time Lord who'd actually stayed in
  captivity for a hundred years just to protect them.
- He had thrown up all sorts of barriers in their path - Möbius Spheres, Time Loop
  fields, Snap Mines, Artron Bursts, and other goodies.
- Their TARDIS was still in pursuit of his, but was having to fly carefully to avoid
  the obstacles.
- She was utterly baffled by his actions.
- They needed each other, that's how it always was, so why was he doing this?
- Why go to such lengths?
- Did he not want to see her?
- That thought hurt.
- Maybe this version didn't love her, didn't want to be with her.
- The Master was going to do something impossibly noble and stupid and it was going
  to make Susan really upset.
- He still wasn't quite sure how he felt about having two of himself around the place,
  but he knew one thing, any harm coming to either of them would make Susan miserable.
- Why would you tell her about.../ The thought broke off suddenly.
- the Master cursed.
- He didn't catch it in time and it opened up too close to a Möbius Sphere.
- Rose screamed as a giant hand seemed to grab the TARDIS and shake them around.
- the Doctor breathed, hoping against hope as the other TARDIS almost made it, but
  after a timeless moment of stillness, his ship also was caught in the whirlpool.
- The laws of physics snapped, the probability matrix was tossed aside and for a instant,
  causal effect failed completely.
- Somewhere, unfortunately, other than inside of the TARDIS.
- The reconstruction process took several seconds, and luckily it did so; for while
  they remained in the shimmering field of passage, they didn't pick up too much momentum.
- It was still possible to see its domes glittering in the perpetual moonlight cast
  by no less than seven brilliant moons.
- This now was the realm of the Kza, thick, armoured, and green; they roamed through
  the shattered hallways and over the pitted grey surface alone.
- It took additional time for this hole to grow large enough to allow the first insect
  through, a chunky beetle the size of a silver dollar.
- It moved in a slow, leisurely manner.
- Every time it flapped its wings, there was a spark generated at its wing-tips; and
  this generated sufficient propulsion to move it forwards.
- Its pincers easily carved off a chunk the size of a pea, which it consumed quickly.
- The beetle buzzed for a moment or two more, made a couple of uncertain hops at random
  angles.
- There was a brief flash, and then it simply stepped away from itself.
- Instantly covered, it went down in just under three minutes as it was devoured whole.
- A gigantic mound of new beetles marked the spot where it had fallen.
- London whirled into action, moving almost too fast to see, while Kimberly fired
  down with pinpoint precision into the grouping.
- Diana screamed happily, while Kimberly screeched and the others shouted.
- He clamped his mouth shut, holding his breath by instinct, but his lungs felt like
  they were on fire already.
- He was barefoot, with only a jumper and jeans on, and the cold was seeping into
  his clothes.
- There was something wrong with the world, it moved in a strange jerky way, time
  folding back in on itself.
- They looked at first like the bones of some great beast, but he blinked and they
  resolved themselves into more familiar forms.
- He was near a half constructed building.
- The wind was whipping through the site, screaming down from the nearby mountains.
- She materialized completely and felt gravity reaching for her.
- She looked around frantically as the branch creaked and spotted a ledge below her.
- There aren't a lot of handholds and the wind is really picking up./ She tried to
  hide her nervousness from him, but failed, and could sense his own rising alarm.
- She was not going to get blown off this damn ledge and then try to regenerate in
  the middle of a howling blizzard.
- she called.
- the new girl asked.
- We're here to break you out.
- she asked in a wail.
- He reached for Rose's mind and could barely feel her, so she was either unconscious
  or out of range.
- It jerked and shuddered under her, but she finally managed to track it properly.
- Now that she could feel the direction of gravity clearly, she pushed herself up
  through the snow, burrowing like a mole, kicking snow down and digging her way upwards.
- She was cold, tired, sore, bruised, and worried sick about the Doctor.
- She was trying to warm herself, forcing her hearts to beat faster and keep her blood
  circulating.
- he called, but his sensors found no one on board.
- She'd been made, programmed, and then dumped into a loop of time.
- A Loop that was precisely twenty-three minutes long.
- He was scared to venture too close to any of it, fearful he could slice open one
  of his bare feet on a submerged piece of wreckage.
- It was at least ten below zero and the wind chill factor made it even worse; and
  everyone was wearing what they had been wearing when the alarms had roused them,
  and that was it.
- He didn't know where the TARDIS was and he knew that once he'd gotten to Susan,
  they would still need to seek out shelter.
- It was also frozen and dripping icicles, as was the cliff above her.
- She could feel the terrible power of the wind and while she was wearing jeans, trainers,
  and her jacket, she didn't exactly have a parka on.
- If she stayed down here, she'd be warmer, but the snow would keep falling and burying
  her deeper and deeper.
- She frowned grimly and reached out for the other Time Lords.
- He swept his head back and forth, red eyes shining in the darkness and then trotted
  towards the console room.
- He was alone in the TARDIS and things were in poor shape.
- Construction site!
- The mind that had conceived a thousand plans for domination and destruction raced,
  as he turned back and looked carefully at the discarded equipment.
- There!
- A Tapezian Construction Drone!
- He dashed to it and flung open the cabin door, only to stare around in dismay.
- It was half gutted, rotting, and falling apart.
- I adore you,/ she sent back, pouring her love of him, her absolute faith in him,
  into his mind.
- /I'll stay put, you go be a stone cold genius./ She was relaxing, panic receding,
  as her trust in him overrode her fear.
- He found himself standing in the middle of an incipient blizzard barefoot in jeans
  and a jumper, with no laser screwdriver, rebuilding a Drone from the parts of all
  the others, while feeling strangely calm.
- Her faith in him steadied him, centred him somehow.
- He could feel them out there, like twin stars shining out and he grinned.
- He took a breath and let it out.
- He'd made it off the ice and now he looked down to where his marriage bond trailed
  away from him.
- She was plodding through miles and miles of white and grey.
- She stepped down and her foot crunched on something.
- She refocused her eyes and stared at the thing buried in the snow for a long while,
  trying to make sense of it.
- She was scanning the area for any signs of the Howdads.
- Tella-19's nervous question reminded her that for all her low number, 19 was relatively
  young.
- With that much time, events can shift and change.
- People can change their minds, decide not to bomb one area, or choose to attack
  another.
- Luckily, the Wastes don't have much that either side wants, so it's really rare
  that anything happens here.
- No wonder the girl was so shy.
- She was really good at nineteen-day friendships, but she wasn't sure how'd she'd
  do past day twenty.
- It was black and grotesque and sort of mummified.
- But now that he was looking around, there were others, hands, heads, legs...
- human bodies buried in the snow.
- He was standing in the middle of a field of slaughter, ancient though it was.
- Rose cried and fell on him, kissing him frantically.
- She rolled over and saw her blood on a rock near her head.
- She was wearing a nightshirt and matching pyjama pants, but had lost her carpet
  slippers.
- For some reason that annoyed her.
- She'd really liked the carpet slippers, she'd never had any before and ...
- She turned slowly, feeling sick and a bit dizzy and realized that there was a crashed
  spaceship here, in among a field of debris.
- It was almost cut in half, but there was a large enough section of wall to reduce
  the wind.
- She tried not to look at the bodies in the snow.
- But she found an old rusted saw blade, some tools, and a welding torch.
- She'd been in this Loop for so long that everything in it was intimately familiar
  to her.
- She knew every face, every square inch of it.
- This place, terrible as it was, was all she'd ever known.
- Diana-37 extended a hand to her and she took it.
- She didn't tell them it was the name of one of the soldier's dogs.
- She thought that they might laugh, but, she really loved that dog.
- The Dalek slaves had once been sentient beings and they'd been turned into mindless
  puppets and sent to kill.
- Now, he was alone here in the snow.
- It was ugly, graceless, and falling apart, but he found himself patting it lovingly.
- Diana-37 growled as she watched him.
- It was stupidly dangerous, but the damn thing was trying to eat Cassidy-9 and she
  could see that he didn't have many options.
- Cassidy-9 grumbled and brought the sword around, slicing the dragon's foreleg, while
  Jake leaped clear.
- /I found a shuttle.
- /The Loops were designed for the Mashas, it was never meant for Time Lords to have
  to.../ but she had to break off.
- He could hear a terrible rumbling noise and looking ahead could see where the river
  fell off the edge of the world.
- A waterfall.
- A huge rock reared up and he realized that there was no way the chunk of ice would
  avoid it.
- With a muttered curse, he plunged off the floe and into the river.
- The cold was awful, like being flayed alive.
- He kicked frantically, breaking the surface with a gasp, choking up water, and feeling
  like he'd been beaten from head to toe.
- Down here, the current was much weaker.
- He struggled against the pull of it, fighting the way the cold was sucking the warmth
  and life from him, and crawled onto an icy, frozen bank.
- He pulled himself up onto shore, tiny hard pebbles slipping and scraping his hands
  and knees until he was out of the water completely.
- He was going to have to think of a plan B, and he was going to have to think of
  it soon, because by the time he found his TARDIS, he was going to have to have it
  in place.
- It sounded like it would take the Doctor and Rose a while to arrive.
- She looked at the few tools and things that she had gathered.
- There was a small pile of screws and some screwdrivers, a hammer, and some tins
  that might have held food at some point, but that she was now melting snow in.
- The clothes to be found around the barrels were...
- not suitable for use, but there was stuff all around here, junk, bits and pieces
  of crashed ships...
- maybe she could find something suitable so that everyone didn't freeze.
- Searching was going to be grotesque, but it had to be done.
- They were going to lose people if they couldn't get warm.
- Something gleamed between two consoles.
- Diana-37 protested.
- It was a fortress, floating in space, shielded and gunned, designed to invade enemy
  planets.
- The Cklil were highly intelligent and vicious, they weren't above scavenging such
  a prize from a lesser species.
- They didn't trust portals, and the first beetles to appear through it were blasted
  into atoms.
- For a long time nothing came through; and then the beetles came en masse.
- It didn't take the Cklil long to realize that the larger beetles were commanding
  the smaller swarms, and they aimed their weaponry appropriately; one of the large
  beetles took a direct hit, shattering into countless numbers of unintelligent, small
  beetles.
- In the end, the ruins of the Cassiopeia hung in space, with no further signs of
  resistance.
- The beetles munched contentedly on their new prize.
- It was far too big on her.
- In her bare feet, she was just tall enough to lay her head against his shoulder,
  but had to stretch a bit to kiss him, so the suit had the arms and legs rolled up
  to make it fit.
- It was a serious question.
- Rose asked, shivering beside him as they walked.
- Sadly, the Master, who I used to think was quite clever, did the absolutely stupidest
  thing in the history of stupid things, and dropped a Time Loop and a Möbius Sphere
  next to each other and he damn near tore a hole in the Space Time Continuum!
- Only the fact that the two TARDIS were there kept it from becoming a complete disaster,
  but it was still a near thing!
- I really thought better of him, honestly!
- We're bloody well on the wrong bloody side of a bloody Loop!
- Adie looked in lockers and any bit of any ship that might hold supplies.
- London-11 complained.
- she said with a grin.
- the Doctor commanded and leaped on top of Rose bearing her to the ground, ending
  up face first in the snow, as something black and with smoke trailing from it, skidded
  over their heads and into the snow.
- Ski the fields of corpses!
- When it… proved to be just a bit too effective, it was put away somewhere.
- I would have locked it up by itself.
- Something that survived no matter what.
- Something to overrun Dalek worlds.
- I never saw the specifications but from what I recall, there were a number of varieties
  that performed different functions.
- If I remember correctly, they were able to merge themselves into larger bugs if
  they needed additional processing power, they were able to listen into telepathic
  conversations, they could split apart and become quite tiny if needed… the main
  thing that I remember is that they were supposed to be able to eat through anything.
- Keep an eye out for any silver metallic insects.
- And Doctor… I found a disk.
- It was mostly in darkness, because night was falling, but with occasional points
  of light from blazing old barrels.
- she shouted, or tried to, over the wind, which was picking up like it meant business.
- Adie had tied down a couple of tarpolines over the hole to form a sort of shielded
  tent, and pulled every barrel she could find nearby, and set it alight.
- Inside she had found a variety of old things that she had set out; some ancient
  uniforms of various sorts, including shoes, a few rations, not much else.
- For now, this little oasis would serve to allow them all a breather, but those tarps
  were never going to stand up to a real storm, and it was only a matter of time before
  the fuel in the barrels was exhausted.
- She was experimenting all the time, pushing things, taking mad risks.
- Finally, she was expelled and sent away.
- Even after they dragged her back, during the War, she kept at it.
- she cried and her anguish was jagged and cutting against Adie's mind.
- Susan tucked it away again, behind her shields, but not before Adie had a brief
  glimpse of a room, elegant and beautiful, but littered with people, lying on the
  floor, screaming, as their bodies were being eaten out slowly from the inside by
  Artron energy, while the Rani stood there, face mildly interested, taking notes.
- Koschei snapped back.
- I had to stop her time and again from 'experimenting' on our allies!
- She was dissecting them alive!
- He shook his head.
- He looked around at the landscape.
- When he realized what she had done… I've never seen the Master so angry.
- He went out to stop her.
- She shook her head, forcing herself out of her reverie.
- the Doctor muttered again.
- Rose hugged him before he stepped out into the snow and then she began scouring
  the interior for warmer clothes and food.
- He shrugged.
- Still, it was getting hard to feed the sixteen they'd found.
- He was looking for shelter, but primarily he was looking to climb a particularly
  tall metal strut that he had spotted.
- It might have been an antenna tower at some point in the past.
- She nodded, but was still worried.
- She hated feeling so helpless and ineffectual.
- Koschei teased, but his eyes lacked any humour.
- The readings he was getting from it worried him.
- As he searched, something caught his attention.
- A strange fluctuation in the fabric of space-time.
- it's leaking.
- The Loop is leaking.
- I can't tell in the storm if they have found the opening or not but.../ He shook
  her head.
- Aggressive and highly territorial, they were accustomed to using their tiny size
  and countless numbers to overwhelm larger foes.
- The Doctor was ...
- complicated.
- Not to say that Susan and Koschei were simple-minded, open folks, but the Doctor...
- he was layered.
- It was like there were levels inside of him and they went down deep.
- The maths for it all wound through Rose and Koschei's minds and she could feel them
  working on the problem.
- They all were.
- something too tiny to perceive very well.
- They couldn't be much larger than a dime.
- They were buzzing around it, biting, widening the gap.
- There was just too much data they didn't have.
- The Master would undoubtedly have been able to provide this data...
- It even looked like a fruit wasp, with dainty silvery wings, an impossibly thin
  waist, and wings made of silvered fibres.
- It was staring right at him, its head tilting rhythmically back and forth, back
  and forth, like a clock or metronome.
- No, it was alone.
- Just a single, off from its group, and maybe blown off course by this damnable wind.
- / Theta, have you found shelter?
- We need to get somewhere safe.
- /All right, I am heading to the ship, home in on me.
- He shook his head and put that aside for later.
- Koschei looked dubiously around at the shreds and tatters of fabric.
- Those poor people, he thought to himself, looking at the bodies flung about inside.
- The corridors were painted in the ubiquitous hospital green that seemed to be the
  human ideal for medical facilities.
- The corridors were wide, designed for wheeling patients through on trolleys, but
  the crash had twisted the walls and cracked the floor tiles.
- But if we could get a little, then we could turn on the heat, maybe get some of
  the scanners working.
- I can't budge it.
- It was clear where he had tried and failed to leverage it away.
- It was muffled through all the dirt, the thick metal hull, and the closed door,
  but it sounded like the buried hospital ship was caught in a waterfall of ball bearings.
- It didn't let up.
- Despite the tropical warmth of this Loop, Shevia still was wearing furs, though
  she'd sloughed off layers until she was wearing essentially a fur bikini.
- They followed her, as she threaded her way through the falling bombs, knowing where
  each one would land from long experience.
- It was her Loop after all.
- Adie told them and went to explore the interior of the ship.
- As she paced down the corridor, she was surprised to find that it was larger than
  she had anticipated.
- Only a tiny bit must be above ground, she reasoned.
- She held up a new uniform, thick and warm.
- They're insulated.
- She gave the brown-eyed doctor a searching look.
- She flicked a few switches idly, looked at the lights.
- He'd walked all through the night, only stopping to ransack a downed craft.
- He'd layered several jackets and pairs of pants he'd found inside of it on top of
  each other.
- He might look a bit silly, but he was warmer, and that was the important part.
- The size of a Volkswagen, it had allowed itself to be covered with drifts, its metallic
  exterior blending perfectly with the surrounding ice and snow.
- The pincers missed his neck, barely, but pain erupted in his left hand and blood
  fountained abruptly, falling, freezing even as it did, onto the snow like vivid
  scarlet snowflakes.
- When the beetle opened its pincers again, he pulled the trigger.
- He knew what he had to do or he would bleed to death.
- He would have vomited, but he didn't have anything in his stomach just then.
- He leaned against the wall, his shoulders hunched, his face uncharacteristically
  wet.
- He looked down at his hand, to reassure himself that it was still there.
- Susan lay curled in the mass of blankets beside him, staring up at him, eyes wide.
- Adie, Rose, and the Doctor were still sleeping.
- he asked her in a whisper and she nodded.
- Her feelings of alarm and consternation were both gratifying and unpleasant to him.
- Gratifying, because his wife loved every part of him, every aspect, every regeneration,
  with equal depth and passion, unpleasant because of the exact same reason.
- He was instantly aware of his own jealousy...
- of himself.
- she murmured and he nodded.
- The Master leaned against the wall, holding the stump of his wrist under his other
  arm, for no reason other than that he was feeling rather shaky.
- It was unlikely that even the large bug would be able to escape from the gravity
  well of the resulting black hole.
- It was his last shot at beating this thing.
- His other-self had to get Susan out of here.
- You knocked her TARDIS out!/ was the reply.
- /Besides, she'd never agree to leave you./ The Master felt a rush of bitterness
  at that.
- He couldn't imagine that the other's Susan cared a brass farthing about him.
- Why should she, after all?
- He had to get moving before the rest of the swarm showed up.
- /From there you can make repairs and get to a safe distance./ He paused.
- /And you needn't taunt, all right?
- I'm freezing my arse off in the middle of one of the Rani's less brilliant plans!
- It was a Wasp, as big as he was.
- The dismantling of the beetle had attracted it.
- In spite of its sudden appearance, he counted himself beyond lucky that there was
  only one.
- He was off-balance, dizzy from the blood loss and shock, and it was throwing off
  his aim.
- He couldn't have said what instinct allowed him to bring the energy blaster around,
  between the creature's eyes.
- The stinger was actually detachable; with the core matrix disrupted, the wasp would
  be breaking down into its component parts any second.
- The stinger would be left behind.
- He had to pull himself off of it, get moving.
- What's happening?/ she sent desperately to the Master.
- His mind was eerily like her husband's, yet also different.
- She looked at Koschei and he looked at her, taking her hand in his.
- The Doctor, Rose, and Adie came out of the storeroom, looking sleepy and puzzled.
- She rushed past them, without speaking, pushed out of the downed shuttle and into
  the teeth of the blizzard.
- She blinked away the driving snow and hoped that these suits were really rated for
  this intense cold, because, if they weren't, she was in serious trouble.
- the Doctor shouted after her, but Koschei grabbed his arm.
- His own emotions were whipsawing through him, a confused mess of reactions that
  he couldn't sort through.
- There was jealousy, but there was also a strange sort of happiness.
- he insisted and the Doctor stared at him in shock.
- Now, let's formulate a bloody plan to defeat the Manifold!
- He looked over at Adie and gave her a weak smile.
- The Wasp was gone, so it must have shattered like the Beetle.
- He turned his head and realized that he was still pinned to the wall by the stinger.
- He panted, his lips dry, his hearts doing a crazy drum roll.
- He couldn't stay here.
- The Manifold would be here soon, not to mention the blizzard.
- All he wanted to do was save Susan and then die, leaving her to a better life.
- She had to save him.
- It had taken her centuries to understand, but she finally had.
- Too late, she'd thought, but then she had gotten a second chance.
- Now, that was what she had to give him.
- A second chance.
- Her hearts ached with grief at the sight.
- A sheer cliff rose above it, cutting some of the wind and she staggered forwards,
  slipping in the icy snow until she spotted a pool of black and red amongst all the
  white.
- She just stood there, staring at him.
- He was still the same as he had been during the War.
- She wondered why she should be shocked by that, but she was.
- He was tall and slender, with curly black hair and dark eyes.
- she scolded and jumped down beside him.
- She took off her backpack and rummaged for the first aid pack she packed from the
  crashed ship's Medi-bey.
- He was dreaming, or else he was having a complete psychotic break with reality.
- It was possible he could have gotten some venom in the wound.
- Gone were the green eyes and long dark hair, she had regenerated, and her face was
  now Miranda's.
- He wouldn't have thought that he recalled Miranda so clearly.
- He could even smell her scent on the air; it was too clear a vision for venom, too
  real.
- It occurred to him that he was terribly thirsty, but he forced the thought away
  to concentrate.
- I have to get that thing out of your shoulder and get you to my TARDIS!
- You're bleeding!
- The TARDIS isn't far.
- She was… so impossibly lovely.
- Her warm sunlight was bathing him and he wanted to curl into it and let go.
- she snapped back at him.
- he snarled.
- Back behind that wall and stay there.
- He didn't believe she was real.
- Had he been alone for so long?
- His energy was shredded and tattered, he was falling apart before her eyes and she
  could do nothing.
- His energy, for all that it was in such bad shape, was unmistakably Koschei's.
- They were the same man, really and truly.
- She looked at him and felt the same want and need that she felt for her husband.
- In a moment, when he had had a chance to marshal his defences, he would open his
  eyes, look at the wall, and it would be empty.
- Then he would make his way down to the TARDIS.
- she sobbed and started pulling at his clothes, shoving pads of fabric and gauze
  against the wounds.
- Stop moving!
- You will bloody well listen to me, you great git!
- He couldn't stop staring at her.
- She was holding him, her body solid underneath his arm, against his side.
- It's me!
- she insisted.
- She started moving, and he allowed himself to be pulled along by her.
- he finally managed.
- she told him, her face screwed up against the wind and snow.
- she ordered and he did.
- At first, all he could see was the blur of white and the red splotches of his blood
  on the snow, but, as he focused his eyes, he saw it, the thin golden thread, stretching
  between them, tying their hearts together.
- How had he not seen?
- He could feel her trembling with cold and exhaustion, her face set and determined,
  but so pale, her lips blue-tinged.
- Pick up your damned feet!
- He forced his body to work, tried to take some of the weight off of her.
- Her fingers must be nearly frozen, he knew, and her movements were slow and and
  fumbling, but she managed to find it at last.
- She dragged herself to the console and shut the door.
- He just about jumped out of his skin again at the sound of it.
- she patted him gently and smiled.
- she replied absently, trying to run a diagnostic as she talked.
- He reached out with his only hand and almost stroked her face with it, but then
  shook his head and pulled it back.
- With my own hands.
- I am your equal as a telepath.
- I knew all along, that I might have to find a way to kill myself, to prevent that
  happening.
- She helped him onto the table, while he stared at her, his eyes never leaving her
  face.
- I'm so sorry that you had to suffer, darling man.
- she sobbed, sniffling as she worked.
- He reached out, withdrew, and then very tentatively stroked her hair with his finger.
- It looked scarier than it was.
- she snorted.
- But, the tears had stopped and her lips were twitching.
- He'd watched her then too, as she moved around a lab, trying to save him.
- Before that it had been the volcano and his TARDIS, he'd guessed that she was a
  doctor back then.
- He'd finally reached the future where she was the age that she had been as Miranda.
- He'd finally gotten to that future and his other self was already there, in the
  place he'd yearned for, for so long.
- She was right next to him and still a million miles away.
- He had to know.
- She glanced at his face and grabbed a painkilling disk, applying it to the skin
  above his wound and numbing the whole shoulder and arm completely.
- He exhaled in relief, as the pain suddenly vanished.
- We can fire it remotely at the damage output we need, if she's the centre focus.
- That would work.
- Rose, Koschei, Adie, and he, were crowded into the smashed up cockpit of the craft,
  the shattered windshield giving a view of packed earth and permafrost, but not much
  else.
- They cut through fields of soldiers as if they were threshing wheat.
- It fell to the earth, coated in insects of every description.
- For them to have gone so far that the pain of other people's deaths meant nothing
  to them anymore, they must have been on the verge of complete mental collapse.
- Insanity was a huge problem towards the end of the War.
- Feeling your friends and loved ones dying all around you, it was ...
- It's a portion of the Timeline of some planet somewhere.
- We've been here a day without a reset, so, I don't know how long it spans.
- I haven't seen a Masha here either, so, it's hard to know much about it.
- But, somewhere out there, there is this world.
- It is missing this piece of Time, but it's there.
- Maybe it was never attacked at all.
- It's possible that the Manifold, being released into this Loop were never responsible
  for any deaths at all there.
- All these corpses could have not died, could be walking around somewhere, far away,
  never having experienced any of this.
- The Doctor frowned.
- She paused as she realized what she was saying.
- He paused and then chuckled.
- We have extremely advanced psychiatric services.
- Things that Never Were, or things that Could Have Been, starting appearing.
- We ended up in a War with the Daleks and also against our own nightmares, against
  realities that shouldn't even have existed in the Main Timeline.
- Time was literally falling apart.
- That's why we ended up with the Time Lock.
- It was Time snapping shut, folding into itself to protect the greater time line
  from what we were doing.
- It was pure self-defence and it destroyed us.
- The Doctor shook his head.
- The only idea I could come up with, is that he forgot about it.
- Jake looked at her and Diana looked back at him.
- He was far away and yet also always right there beside her, inside of her.
- She started a diagnostic for them, trying to see how they'd been impacted by the
  crash and feeling horribly guilty through it all.
- There was no way terrorists could ever break into the TARDIS, after all.
- But it was obvious that this solution had its own dangers and she was wishing desperately
  that they were back safe on Gallifrey.
- Of Miranda… of Susan.
- An unexpected and wonderful dream.
- He must have been absolutely delirious.
- He didn't open his eyes at once.
- He didn't want to wake up from the dream where her eyes had been brown and her hair
  had been red, and he had stroked it with one of his fingers.
- Both hands, still there, he noted, though his left was a bit pink, the skin a lighter
  colour, the callouses gone.
- When he finally did, he just stared at her.
- He was not mad, but this was not his Susan.
- This was the Susan of the other timeline.
- His other self must have sent her here.
- She was here, and she was doing what she had always done, making him feel that sense
  of peace, that quiet happiness that he only ever felt when he was in her presence.
- he asked her in a low voice.
- she retorted, looking at him in absolute disbelief.
- He had cheated death a hundred times.
- Somehow, he was never quite so fortunate as to lose.
- she rolled her eyes.
- Fifteen?
- Twenty?
- she groused.
- Thank you for everything you did.
- Mathematically, there is no other way.
- He had forgotten how impossibly beautiful she was.
- The brilliant sunshine of her soul was moving through him and he had to fight not
  to lean into it, desperate for the warmth she was giving off.
- she asked, looking up at him with a perplexed expression.
- His hearts plunged into his feet and he turned away from her on pretence of kneeling
  down to pick up his discarded shoes.
- If she was bound up to this new version of their world, as well as the other version
  of himself, then there really was no place for him in her life.
- Thought they would be together?
- What could he say?
- She poured herself into the kiss, giving her hearts to him, and shaking him to the
  core.
- Her mind, her soul, entwined with his own and he hadn't the strength of will to
  resist when he was so hungry for her.
- she asked, head cocked and gentle brown eyes watching him in confusion.
- That sort of thing isn't easily forgotten.
- He scowled, trying to find the arguments he needed to convince her that being around
  him was pure folly, but not having much luck, when she was pressed against him so
  enticingly.
- It was so much to absorb.
- Her father?
- Evarian?
- He hadn't seen him in centuries and couldn't imagine that the chilly prig had anything
  pleasant to say to any version of him.
- Neutral?
- What miracle had occurred to make the people who'd spat on him, who'd watched his
  utter and abject humiliation by Rassilon, suddenly no longer feel contempt and hatred
  for him.
- It was like everything he had done so far had been for nothing.
- He shook his head.
- she asked, her eyes on his sad.
- He'd nearly killed her.
- Again.
- I felt your pain, your grief, and your anguish, all the way on Gallifrey.
- There were no words.
- she asked.
- I'm bound to him, but I'm also bound to you.
- How could I possibly let go of one for the other?
- she shook her head.
- She had always had the power to strip him to his core and leave him naked and vulnerable.
- Her eyes were filled with the same fragility.
- Diana-37 nodded and stood up without another word.
- Zoi-29's engineering skills were becoming legendary amongst them.
- If she said it would hold, then it would hold.
- She had rescued eighteen of her sisters now and while it had taken them more than
  a year, they were building up a kind of momentum.
- Jake-77 shouted.
- After a minute she pointed to the scan readings in the cockpit of the ship.
- I think we're fairly close to the Master's TARDIS.
- And you never know...
- They were long dead and gone and the battlecruiser was now a floating hulk.
- It remained in surprisingly good condition, considering how long it had been abandoned.
- They settled on the battle cruiser like dewdrops, and their tough little pedipalps
  cut through the Dalekenium like a hot knife through butter.
- Alarms started blaring at once.
- Endless trails of locusts were all that marked its passing.
- By now the size of the swarm was unthinkable, shifting wisps of silver reaching
  all the way from one end of the Möbius Loop to the other.
- Her Time Lord biology was incredibly tough, but even it had it's limits and she
  knew that she had come perilously close to dying out there.
- He looked at the two of them and smiled and it struck Rose again how different he
  was now, from how he'd been when she had first seen him.
- Then he'd been bitter, lost, confused, flailing as he tried to find his footing
  in a mental landscape that had shifted drastically underneath him.
- Now, he was calm and certain.
- The uniforms were still much too large, but they should be sufficient to get them
  to their destination.
- She forced her mind back to the problem at hand, tucking her hair up into a twist
  on her head.
- Rose was touched by that little stretching of her lips.
- Adie was so skittish and shy, but slowly, she was seeming to grow easier in their
  company.
- the Doctor crowed and led the way to hatch, holding Rose's hand and beaming down
  on her fondly.
- She was the oldest amongst them, the original 4, not a copy run off to replace a
  fallen sister.
- The younger Mashas held her in a sort of awe, not that she seemed to care.
- Her Loop had had a library and she'd had hundreds of years to work her way through
  all the books.
- Sometimes the knowledge that he was not going to live weighed on her so heavily
  that she felt like she couldn't breathe.
- he suggested hesitantly, as though he wasn't quite sure himself.
- I thought I had accepted it all when it was purely theoretical, but now...
- I...
- think I'm a bit...
- jealous.
- he asked, sounding a trifle befuddled.
- She talked him down?
- She leaned against the wall for support and tried to wrap her mind around it.
- Despite what everyone had said, she'd never really believed Susan could get to him
  and...
- her mind stuttered.
- What did this mean?
- They were all three together?
- Did that mean the Master would what...
- Gallifrey was gone, most of the Time Lords were dead, Rassilon, the Tower, the Arkytior,
  and now, the Master was going to be there, with them all, as one big happy family?
- She turned and backtracked, stumbling through the ship, blindly, almost mindlessly.
- Part of her mind reminded her that if Koschei, who had been hit by it all far worse
  than she had, could accept the change, she should also.
- Her breath was sticking in her throat and her thoughts were sticking in her head.
- Her hearts were pounding in fear, every remembered slight and insult rising in her
  ears.
- He knew that he'd somehow made a mess of things again.
- he called.
- He fought free of their emotional tides, closing himself off as much as he could
  and striving for calm.
- Please forgive me.
- It's not fair to you for me to just stalk off like that.
- he told her.
- I hadn't even considered that Susan might really pull it off, might be able to get
  him to side with us.
- I guess I wasn't brave enough to face the fact that… that he's going to be around
  us all.
- She sniffled, the tears finally trailing off.
- For Susan and myself, Gallifrey has been gone for nearly a decade.
- It's been even longer for the Doctor, and Rose never had been there.
- For you, it's been a few days only.
- He shook his head.
- She shook her head and tried again.
- no, easier than I thought it would be, but also harder in other ways.
- She's happy and that makes me happy, but I liked being the one that made her happy
  and in a weird way, I still am, but that doesn't change that I feel...
- He sighed.
- his words broke off and he closed his mouth with a snap, hands fisting, as he fought
  not to cry out with them, feeling their climaxes racing through his own body as
  well.
- On the upside, most of them have very forgiving natures.
- I think if we can get through the… hm, initial introduction?
- They might eventually come to accept him.
- Did she ever tell you about the Arthur?
- He shook his head.
- He laughed softly.
- She really, genuinely cares about people; she feels their pain, their joys, their
  little sorrows, and wants to give everything she has inside of her to make things
  better for everyone around her.
- She'll work herself to death to stop a plague, or save a life, and she doesn't know
  how to stop trying.
- That's it.
- The big secret.
- He smiled at her.
- All that she had gone through, the Tower, Rassilon, the War, going back in time
  to save his life, again and again, those two hundred years of having him in her
  head, tied to a madman, while he raged and plotted.
- He thought about the Master, how he was willing to die for her.
- Only Susan can do that and I think that Susan perceives much more joy than you do.
- Why he liked this child so much, why he felt the same trust in her, the same affection
  for her as he did for the Doctor.
- When he was in stasis.
- I can sympathize a bit with Susan's position.
- I always wanted him to… I don't know… like me.
- Or at least notice me.
- He was so cold; I tried to break through that sometimes, but I never could.
- I guess it just… I don't know, makes me sad.
- Look, I was rebuilt when I was eight.
- I grew up with all this rubbish in my head.
- Who I might have been?
- Well, we'll never know, because I never was allowed to grow up without Rassilon's
  influence.
- I've had to fight my way back, to find a moral centre, to be a better man and I
  did that because, when Susan looks at me, that's who she sees.
- A better man.
- He cocked his head studying her.
- I created this vast fortress around my heart, trying not to care, not to feel.
- Everything always hurt so much and I was driven to do things that, deep down, I
  didn't like and so I shoved my feelings far away from myself.
- When they finally all came back to me, I nearly broke.
- Oh Adie, when he wakes up one day and it's all there in front of him, he's going
  to fall apart completely.
- It'll take every one of us to hold him together, to keep him from killing himself.
- Susan ...
- Are you two coming along or not!
- the Doctor shouted as he stomped down the hallway.
- Rose was right behind him, grinning broadly.
- Koschei shook his head, amused by how very much alike the two of them were.
- Doctor… I am very sorry for going to pieces like that.
- Adie blinked in surprise, obviously not sure if he really had been oblivious to
  her distress, or was merely joking.
- Koschei snarked and rolled his eyes.
- the Doctor retorted with a lofty air.
- Even trudging across this icy plain, he was shielded from the cold.
- I mean, really!
- That place was utterly stifling!
- Until Susan came along, I lacked an impetus to launch myself forward.
- However, I'd been contemplating that very question for a rather long time.
- A TARDIS can only be flown by the pilot that it is bonded to psychically and who's
  TNA has been fed into the recognition system.
- The thing is, sometimes a pilot dies.
- he announced, ignoring Koschei's snarking.
- I'd stolen the code...
- but, I still didn't have an actual TARDIS key.
- You can't just steal a TARDIS key and make it work!
- the man who had once been the Master asked with an innocent tone.
- She stopped suddenly in her tracks as another possibility occurred to her.
- The winds of the Dust Loop were howling, but in that cosy shelter, they barely heard
  it.
- The compassionate generosity in him, the desire to keep her from pain, she couldn't
  help but respond to that.
- She missed him desperately, with a painful ache in her chest, even as she found
  herself unable to release the Master.
- /Could we give him a place on the TARDIS?/ she asked, wondering if she was asking
  too much of Koschei.
- I want that too, but we don't yet know how he'll feel about all this.
- With a weary sigh, Rose began climbing up visions of steaming cups of tea at the
  end of this sustaining her.
- she screamed as they charged.
- She screamed, as the shock of pain from landing on a hidden rock, jolted through
  her body.
- Looking down, she saw a jagged, metallic spike pushing through her stomach.
- She tried to take a breath to scream, but couldn't.
- he shouted and used the sonic to short out the bug, it collapsed into thousands
  of tiny insects, leaving Rose lying in the snow, with a gaping hole in her abdomen.
- He wished Susan was there, with her medical tools and knowledge.
- He wasn't sure what to do and there were more bugs coming.
- Koschei shouted.
- he shouted.
- The bed made a slight wheezing sound, as it struggled to power up.
- He gave the monitor a thump and the bed powered up, sealing the gaping wound and
  stabilizing Rose's vitals.
- The power was minimal, but it was enough to throw up the shields.
- Adie called through the intercom.
- he shouted.
- She called down through the trapdoor.
- That won't work!
- The engines are down, without them we're going nowhere!
- There was a smell of ozone and the crackle of something and then the console began
  to rise and fall.
- They were de-materializing.
- Those locusts that had managed to latch onto the outside of the hull remained there,
  even through the de-materialization, they had been designed that way.
- Thankfully, there weren't very many that had managed to slip past the shields.
- She tried oscillating the shields again to shake them off and it took a number of
  tries to finally pry them loose.
- The exterior of the TARDIS probably sported a number of deep holes, she knew, but
  at least the trans-dimensional interface remained intact.
- he asked and shook his head.
- The console room opened up almost directly into it, which made it rather hard to
  ignore.
- Koschei glanced over and then away quickly, not wanting to think about what his
  other self had used some of that equipment for.
- He had enough nightmares about the things he'd done himself without adding more.
- He needed something to wear that wasn't smoking or covered in ash.
- He stripped and stepped into the fresher unit and out again.
- It wasn't as pleasant as a shower, but they were short on time.
- He pushed through, but it wasn't there.
- He frowned.
- Where was it?
- Looking up, there was a box.
- He pulled it down, opened it, and there it was.
- His favourite shirt, the one Susan had worn that first time on Gumphus.
- He shivered, remembering what Adie had said before.
- Susan had died in that other timeline.
- She'd died and never gotten into the Academy, never been a doctor in the War, never
  regenerated into the lovely blonde haired, blue-eyed girl he'd saved from her own
  collapse.
- She'd never helped the others to escape from Gallifrey, or found him again in the
  ruins, bringing him back to life.
- All that they had gone through had never happened to the other him.
- This was all the other him had of her.
- He'd been jealous, hell, he still was, but now he also felt a surge of desperate
  pity for his alternate self.
- He was opening the console and pulling out the crystals, even as he was directing
  her.
- He dropped back under the console and got to work.
- Her name appeared on a list that allowed her to open a few doors, and that was all.
- Of course it was the Master's TARDIS.
- Naturally Koschei, as another version of the Master, would feel fond of it.
- She brushed a dark curl from his brow and felt something in her relax, just a bit.
- Everything between them was still there, intact, just as it always had been, just
  as it was with Koschei.
- Her fear that somehow things wouldn't feel the same, that the differences were too
  great was gone.
- The energy was the same, a bit deeper and more complex, with vast grief and terrible
  anguish underlining everything in him, but he was still essentially the same as
  he'd always been since they were children.
- It was all coming back to him, as he looked at his oldest and best friend.
- Looking the Doctor's face made him feel uncomfortable.
- There was too much naked emotion there and he suddenly felt as though he was intruding.
- He looked up and it was Theta, the little boy he'd played pranks with, the young
  man he'd laughed with, the best friend turned worst enemy, as he went mad.
- It was his friend, asking for his help.
- He knew it was an inane question even as he said it, but he was completely at a
  loss just then.
- How do you apologize for hundreds of years of trying to kill someone?
- How do you cross the breach of years of dreadful plots, move past all the deaths,
  and the horror?
- What do you say to your best friend after everything you had put him through?
- He turned and finally really looked at him.
- I didn't know.
- I didn't meet you again until afterwards.
- he babbled.
- The Master winced, knowing that the inconsequential chatter was Theta's way of trying
  not to think about the pain he was in.
- He knew, from first-hand experience, how terrible it could be.
- The slender golden cord between the Doctor and Rose told him everything he needed
  to know.
- We're aboard a hospital TARDIS with the best doctor in this quadrant.
- Even thinking about her lying still and cold, eyes vacant, made him shudder.
- After all, it occurred to him, after a hundred years feeling dead inside, anything
  had to be better.
- The figure had been pounding on the interior surface of the container, trying to
  attract his attention.
- he shouted.
- He quickly began the sequence to get her out.
- The faltering systems were diverting power from the stasis tubes and if he didn't
  work fast, they would all suffocate inside.
- There were five more inhabited tubes, stacked against the lab's wall, like firewood.
- Adie told him and the sound of the alarms was rising in pitch.
- Koschei told her and she repeated the process twice more, while he and Adie lifted
  out the other girls.
- He reached for her mind, but there was nothing there.
- She was looking up at him with a trusting face, her mind as unformed as an infants.
- he asked.
- Diana shouted and they all hefted their packs and marched forward.
- His other self was sitting on the floor, cradling one of the clones in his arms.
- He was the version from Miranda's photo, he realized suddenly.
- Koschei was staring at...
- himself really, in horror.
- he turned around to look at his other self.
- he scowled at his other self.
- Susan wouldn't like it, but this was the Rat, the problems he'd had with her again
  and again.
- But...
- We need her original personality, the one you took out of her.
- he spit out.
- He could see it.
- The girl was lying right there, looking helpless, looking like Susan had when he'd
  carried her from the Tower.
- There is an exponential curve involved and, if we do not set up the Lens for the
  Manifold, there's going to be no stopping them!
- he snapped back.
- he pointed out, growing exasperated.
- The truth was that he would have done anything for Susan, even this, but he couldn't
  help but feel he was cutting his own throat.
- He could see that what he'd done was wrong, despite it all, but he was scared.
- He was worried that the Rat would go for his throat and that he'd end up having
  to kill her.
- He inclined his head at the sarcophagus that filled up one corner of the room.
- We learned all this to help people!
- The sorrow in his other self's voice, the guilt, and the deep wells of regret just
  rolled out.
- Then Rassilon got in my head and ripped me apart, remade me...
- remade us.
- This is not who you are!
- When we were in separate universes and I thought she was dead...
- You've barely had time to think, it's not fair of me to take that out on you.
- the Master asked him, instead of answering.
- He had too many new thoughts in his head, too many painful pressures.
- He also felt a little guilty about falling into bed with Susan.
- This was her husband, her bondmate, and he was uncomfortable standing there with
  him after...
- The Master felt a bit like a monster, the girl was so tiny and defenceless.
- He paused.
- In the sarcophagus, the girl's aura began to glow, as her personality was brought
  back into her head.
- The glow became very bright very quickly, and her temperature started to spike dramatically.
- The cooling systems helped to counteract some of the excess heat, but it was still
  possible to feel it pouring off of her in waves.
- he asked.
- The next two minutes were very touch-and-go.
- The Master worked with the cooling controls, spitting and swearing, while the girl's
  aura glowed brilliantly.
- Your sisters are in Medi-bay, but Adie says they'll be fine.
- He extended a hand to her to help her up.
- How are you feeling?
- Koschei asked, running the sonic over her.
- I was informed one of you had been put away and then came back.
- The Master broke in angrily.
- You could have fried your brain!
- Koschei soothed.
- He grabbed a spanner, went over to a console, and began working on repairs, his
  brows drawn down as he thought.
- So is the bondmate… now bonded to the both of you?
- uh, 37, explain to you about what Rassilon did to us?
- Right.
- Let me try.
- At eight, Rassilon got into my...
- our head and rewired us.
- When Rassilon died, it all came apart, but everything I was ...
- it was still part of me to some extent.
- I am trying to get my head straight, to get my brain back, but it's not easy, when
  I can't always trust what I think.
- He shrugged.
- He glanced at the Master and sighed.
- No lies, no deceptions, no cover ups, and no omissions.
- he barked a laugh and it was a bitter sound.
- He understood completely.
- He'd like his mother not to have killed herself when he was little, or his father
  not to have been a bastard.
- He'd like to not have been driven mad.
- There was never going to be justice for them though.
- For all that Diana-37 had told her about Koschei, she hadn't really grasped what
  it would mean.
- The Master wasn't the madman she was used to dealing with.
- The Master was as much a victim as she had been, more so, in fact, because she'd
  been allowed the means to resist and he hadn't.
- Without some sort of token to appease the rest of the group, the Master was going
  to end up strung up by his thumbs.
- Too many of the Mashas were bitter, angry, and longed for revenge against the man
  they saw as the author of their suffering.
- That's the price of making sure the Mashas don't so much as harm a hair on your
  head.
- We need their cooperation to fire the Lens!
- You're the one who said she could be reasoned with.
- I felt it was nearly certain that the Master would attempt to capture us physically.
- Realistically, we had absolutely no way to stop him.
- the Master interrupted.
- He was worried about her.
- She was frowning in concentration.
- These are all recursive fractals… there's a point of… what… this doesn't make any…
  what was she doing?
- He looked up at her with a sweet, somewhat shy smile and then ducked back down.
- Koschei stared at him in shock.
- Are you really that naive?
- Rassilon, do anything for just one reason?
- He waved a hand.
- The Lens is a mathematical construct, and I think that the number one and two slots
  are parallel or related concepts somehow.
- Are they going to help?
- the Master asked finally.
- Koschei chuckled mirthlessly.
- Koschei raised his head to look at the Master and wondered if his conflicted emotions
  were as easy to read on his face as the Master's own.
- I can't do that.
- I have caused her enough pain already.
- he laughed.
- With sharing her.
- Because if we get upset, angry, resentful, or jealous, she'll feel it, and it'll
  hurt her.
- I've hurt her enough.
- He looked at the Master.
- the Master stared at his other self and then a wry smile twisted his lips.
- He knew the other him, had been him, at one point and felt a surge of sympathy for
  the other version of himself.
- He'd seen the pathetic little box, with the carefully preserved remnants of a Susan
  who had died.
- he whispered and Koschei looked at him and understood.
- He understood all of it.
- Father always finding us wanting, and then Mother, suicide is the ultimate abandonment,
  after all.
- Even the Doctor and the Lady Professor turned their backs on us.
- Not once.
- Susan stood up to Rassilon for me, withstood pressure and torture to protect me,
  was willing to die for me.
- She suffered and now I cannot make her suffer anymore.
- I can't be selfish, I can't hurt her anymore.
- So, can you help me keep her from any more pain?
- You up to that?
- He said with a frown.
- We'll just have to work to make this go smoothly.
- I never want her to feel like she has to choose, or that she's being pulled in two
  directions.
- He paused.
- In fact, I'd say she's far too content with far too little.
- She needs a certain amount of reassurance.
- Being raised by the Doctor has left her thinking that she's not all that special.
- So, tell her you adore her as often as you can.
- She loves to cook and she's really good at it, it's one of the few areas she's actually
  secure, so eat what she cooks for you, without complaining that you have work to
  do.
- Koschei paused again, trying to find the right words.
- The woman who loped over to her looked visibly older than the rest of them.
- Moira-3's Loop had had one of the fastest Loops they'd been in so far.
- Even though it had a reset of only six days of time, a week had passed in her Loop,
  while only three days had passed in the Dust Loop.
- she asked, her eyes as fathomless and ancient as the Doctor's.
- She'd grown her hair out long, until it was a thick braided rope behind her, her
  clothes were scavenged from whatever she could find in the mountainous region where
  her Loop's war had taken place.
- she asked and passed the binoculars to her.
- He was easy-going, but he'd earned the respect of most of the others.
- he cried.
- she asked and smiled somewhat blearily at him.
- He pulled her down and kissed her softly.
- He glanced at her, where she was sitting, entwined in Koschei's arms and then looked
  away quickly.
- Susan asked and reached out to take his hand in hers, while her other arm remained
  around Koschei.
- He stood up and put a hand on her cheek.
- Her eyes were wide and her face was very pale.
- Susan protested.
- Hello!
- You look nothing alike physically, I mean you look a little like that fellow who
  plays Sherlock, but not at all like Koschei.
- That's probably good, because I think it would get really confusing if you both
  looked exactly alike.
- she told the Master with a broad grin and he blinked at her feeling like someone
  had turned a spotlight on him.
- he stammered.
- the Master pointed out.
- He and Koschei looked at each other and he could tell his other self understood.
- Susan suggested hesitantly.
- She looked rather unhappy and it made his hearts twinge to see it.
- After everything he'd done, it seemed like a lie to take the name of his mother's
  kindly father, with his infinite patience and sweet kindness.
- She smiled up at him and he sighed.
- He stood there feeling confused and uncertain.
- The Locus...
- He stood there, staring at her, trying to find something to say.
- She was so little, was the odd thought that wandered through his head.
- She was terribly young and horribly vulnerable.
- he asked, the words coming out slowly, as he tried to figure out how people talked
  to each other again.
- he asked and she nodded.
- Now, let's see if we can make it so that none of you have to worry about being used
  like that again, though, eh?
- The machinery that channels the energy is here, on this TARDIS.
- If we dump that lot in the nearest black hole, no one can run Artron energy through
  you without your permission.
- He leaned down and tapped her nose with a finger.
- At that point the Lens becomes our responsibility.
- We can gather Artron energy locally.
- I can already run the test pattern.
- She frowned, her brows furrowing.
- People are going to want to get their hands on it for various reasons.
- I don't know… what to do about that.
- If we're going to go after the Manifold, we need to be in top form.
- Wait!
- Oh!
- the Doctor chuckled.
- I was very impressed!
- Hacking your own QTE!
- I am so curious!
- I reset first, then uploaded custom software I had written for the purpose, then
  hacked the executable files, and added filtering.
- he cried and suddenly hugged her.
- She was utterly genius in maths and computers!
- Hard.
- As if she had needed a hug for a very, very long time.
- I am so glad that we were able to rescue you lot!
- Tomoko-6 winced at that and the Time Lords both nodded.
- We got scattered all over, but we made it back here with Adie.
- We were nearly overwhelmed by the Manifold, which are really unpleasant.
- He was bouncing in excitement and Tomoko just blinked at him in bafflement.
- It was you.
- I liked it when you called me Master.
- She could feel the sorrow and grief behind Koschei's refusal, the guilt and the
  feeling that he had failed to resist Rassilon sufficiently, regardless of how impossible
  that had been.
- he insisted and she laughed.
- She pulled out her notepad and frowned at it.
- He was enjoying distracting her.
- Her aura, already painfully bright, seemed to flare a bit.
- I don't want to, it's far too ...
- dangerous.
- She took a breath.
- and Koschei wandered over, his sonic in his hand and grabbed a sandwich.
- Koschei asked her suddenly.
- She paused for a moment.
- Really?
- the Doctor broke in with a huge smile.
- Diana-37 told me about you, told me you would want to help but… I have just been
  in despair about trying to reach you.
- This was clearly the image from a small camera, and Diana-37's face appeared in
  it.
- Everyone repeated this enthusiastically.
- How are things?
- I knew you'd find a way!
- Jake-77!
- he crowed.
- the Doctor protested, but the girls all laughed.
- The conference call is only working because this TARDIS was involved in the creation
  of both of these loops and can act as a hub.
- They worked in silence for a while and the Master was surprised by how natural and
  right it felt.
- There was no telling how long it would last, this time with her, and he tried to
  savour every moment.
- He frowned thoughtfully.
- she asked with a sudden frown.
- I never liked it, but I couldn't find out.
- It was like he was saving it for something special.
- I never figured out what it was.
- She assured him and then pulled away and scrambled to her feet.
- she asked in confusion.
- Doubts nibbled at his mind, making him wonder what good he was, when she already
  had so much.
- He wasn't above staying because she pitied him, though he knew that he probably
  ought to be.
- He crawled out from under the control panel and looked at her.
- She was sitting in the parlour, or whatever the room was, mentally ticking over
  all the problems with the décor .
- She wasn't quite sure what the obsession with black was, but Guinn seemed to have
  had the Goth Bug rather badly.
- The furniture was black, plastic, uncomfortable, minimalist, and ugly.
- The circumstances of its creation demand it.
- Rose scolded.
- Evie-44 was staring at Tomoko-6, hands clenched at her side and face set.
- They all five had the same hair and eyes, the same face and body, but other than
  that, they were each completely different.
- Neveah-72 spat at her, moving to stand beside Evie, her expression one of absolute
  fury.
- Neveah had short cropped hair, combat fatigues and boots, and knives strapped everywhere.
- Honestly, Tomoko could hardly believe it either.
- Sara was wearing a simple jumpsuit, boots and a wool coat, she looked like a college
  student, except for the eyes and skin tone.
- Tyler was dressed in red trousers tucked into black knee-high boots, and a furry
  coat that hung to mid-thigh and looked like it had been taken off of a Yeti.
- The wind had died down.
- It was now just an icy caress on their cheeks.
- Thirty yards away, a large group of the manifold was piled together, wings fluttering
  softly, light reflecting on their iridescent eyes.
- Demanded Tyler-18.
- She gestured at the Manifold bugs sunning themselves, one of them idly chewing on
  a rock.
- We cannot get out of the Loops without their assistance.
- Our day will come.
- The Time Lords cannot defeat the Manifold without our assistance.
- But if we want to live to see that day, we'd better bloody well hold up our end.
- For all of what the Time Lords had done to them, she couldn't help but trust the
  Doctor.
- Her expression was stony, but resolute.
- He felt strongly that he had no right to pry into these girls' lives.
- Koschei had completed some of his repairs, which was no good to anyone if the new
  circuits couldn't be properly calibrated, but it was tricky to do, as the actual
  wiring involved was far under the panel, so she found herself entering and exiting
  the crawlspace every minute or two, trying to check her work.
- Are you injured?
- he answered.
- I mean...
- Just in case, she tucked in her feet.
- She knew it was ridiculous, but she felt better with her feet tucked in.
- His foot was visible and she could see him tapping his toe as he waited.
- A pause as she continued.
- 20.6.
- She was almost afraid to speak to him, but then again the collar was gone forever,
  he was unlikely to lunge at her suddenly, and even if he did, she was in the vent…
  she shook her head.
- He frowned.
- He shook his head.
- he asked softly.
- She was going to be seeing a lot of him, and was making a conscious effort to accept
  matters as they were and try to move forwards; but most conversations about tolerances
  had been very unpleasant ones.
- The old, reflex phrases really weren't useful any more.
- She was scrambling for something useful or positive to say, and failing.
- well, some things really were just me, I guess.
- I used to talk to you all the time while you were in stasis.
- I have absolutely no idea.
- less...
- cruel, more actually funny.
- You have another version of yourself married to the woman you love and now you are
  a threesome.
- Even if the methods varied, the entire point was for him to make himself over into
  the most powerful person in the universe.
- He wanted worship, control, to be the one in ultimate charge of everything.
- hardly gone.
- Susan pointed out to me that I made rather rebellious children, which she attributes
  to my unconscious effort to resist Rassilon.
- he asked in surprise.
- she said curiously.
- Differentiation has nothing to do with caution, or at least not in the way you are
  thinking.
- You sound different.
- You see the world in different ways.
- You don't use the same vocabulary.
- You have different gestures and vocal inflections.
- She smiled at him again, her face feeling odd as the unaccustomed expression returned
  again so quickly.
- They were back in the console room again.
- No.
- It was Omega's engineering that created the Eye, Rose, but it was Rassilon's equations
  that framed it.
- I had to kill him.
- he insisted.
- the Doctor announced and grinned broadly at them all.
- Repairs had progressed to the point where her current job was to pull on a particular
  lever when Koschei gave her the word, but he wasn't ready yet.
- But no matter how much she paged back and forth, or studied diagrams or notes she
  didn't seem to be able to find what she was looking for.
- Stop!
- Koschei shouted.
- Evie!
- The I'll being at the beginning, as it were.
- He stood up and began pacing the room, gesturing as he talked.
- The things we do know for sure is that there were...
- powers.
- He stared off into space, thinking hard.
- the Other based the Time Lords.
- Yes, Stellar Manipulator, Eye of Harmony, time travel, right, yes, we got all that,
  but it wasn't the point!
- We were stupid, young, arrogant, foolish!
- But!
- he spun and pinned her with a fierce gaze, a look of intense focus that was almost
  uncomfortable.
- The things we can see!
- Her name is lost to history, sadly, but she burned even brighter than you do right
  now.
- She was a focus for one of those powers I mentioned earlier.
- Given the exact right configuration of energies, the women of our line can have
  that activate in them.
- They become something else, you understand?
- A terrible force that burns out any but the strongest of will, the most fit of mind.
- Something that should not be here, in this universe, can enter through that focus
  and ...
- Tomoko cried, her mind working as she sorted through the data in her head.
- She could feel herself heating up, but ignored it.
- However, that is neither here nor there.
- What happens when we do fire the Lens?
- don't think so.
- She realized that there needed to be some way to regulate the energy that her focus
  was channelling, so she creates an 'Anchor'.
- Tomoko thinned her lips, and then shook her head.
- Koschei asked, shaking his head.
- the Doctor snapped out and crossed his arms with a frown.
- Rose giggled, but Tomoko noticed that neither Susan nor Koschei did.
- You're the best!
- he told her.
- Ask the butterflies?
- The space was vast and a heavy cloud of mist covered the ground to her knees, it
  was damp and a bit prickly feeling.
- A small surge of electricity shot through the mist and she realized that the prickly
  feeling was an ion charge.
- High above, vines and creepers grew, a second layer of filtering after the trees,
  she deduced.
- Flitting around a forest somewhere, doing butterfly things?
- She could find out from Koschei later if it was a manufactured thing, or if it had
  once been real, and simply filled with electronics.
- If it had once been real, she could come back later and put it out of its suffering.
- At first glance it appeared random, but Tomoko quickly picked out the Fibonacci
  sequence in the block's arrangement.
- One tube was congested with something and the butterfly fluttered at it.
- The tubes were sectional, with brass connectors between each part.
- She asked the butterfly and it displayed the image of a plunger.
- She reattached the tube and checked the water, taking the paperish note in her other
  hand.
- She headed back to the Fibonacci blocks and climbed up them to get her out of the
  worst of the static charge, then pulled out her own tablet.
- All external transmissions blocked.
- However, the Lord President himself requested me to put in further work on the project.
- It's not as though I could refuse.
- It's horrible.
- These girls, they look like they're our daughter's age.
- I can't believe how horribly the Sistron Articles are being violated by this project.
- I asked Marainithren if we could lodge a protest, but she said that the last three
  engineers to do so disappeared.
- It's terrible here; we're all scared all the time.
- It's like he doesn't even care if he's killed.
- He argues with Rassilon all the time, like he's daring him to execute him.
- He's entirely focused on the project, talks to us all like we're computers.
- It's weird; he used to at least be charmingly insane, now he's just dead.
- They insist that her TNA must be used, no other.
- I say 'they', but of course I mean Rassilon.
- He's obsessed with the girl, always stroking her head, like she was a pet or something.
- No clone was allowed to be created solely for medical experimentation, no clone
  was allowed to be speed-grown to adulthood, except under specific conditions, all
  clones were the legal child of their creator, unless adopted by another adult, and
  the clones were subject to the same legal rights and inheritance of a child.
- ! 'Amended text: Massively egotistical arse-wipe, better off dead and forgotten.'
- Text amended by the Doctor.
- Further information available, but not recommended, because he was a total wanker.
- Tomoko packed up and headed out the door.
- Once the door had been closed to the chamber, and she could use her communicator
  again, she swapped channels.
- Hello dear, you got the environmental systems back up to full?
- he chirped back at her.
- She was surprised, then scowled, shaking her head.
- He was not going to distract her.
- The Pillar was one the computer systems for the TARDIS' navigational controls and
  it buzzed and hummed in the icy air, like a giant hulking beast, grumbling in it's
  sleep.
- It was necessary, because if she had let her intellect roam as it would, she'd have
  quickly over-heated and died.
- Everyone needed to be pulled from their respective loops, organized and outfitted,
  the Manifold would have to be dealt with, the aftermath would have to be worked
  through.
- And then what?
- She was wearing a heavy green coat, with fur around the collar and thick gloves,
  insulated pants and snow boots.
- My fears are not your responsibility.
- I didn't set up this meeting to have Guinn strung up by his thumbs.
- I set it because I need something, I need a… a token.
- She paced around.
- For everybody to cool off.
- She sighed.
- I am too angry right now.
- was never going to see it.
- She ran her fingers through her hair, making it stick up in every direction.
- I knew that he would.
- I knew it before he pulled us all into stasis.
- She took a breath and closed her eyes.
- Her aura was still pulsing furiously.
- She took deep breaths, trying to will herself to be calm.
- For now, though, setting a meeting date and putting it off to some unspecified time
  in the future seemed like the best option.
- We'll all have time to cool off.
- Everyone can familiarize themselves with Koschei, and see for themselves what the
  Master could be like in the future.
- Susan asked.
- she trailed off.
- I wish you didn't have to juggle flaming chainsaws, but you do and I understand.
- That's potentially a very bad combination.
- I'm terrified that one of the Mashas will try to kill him and She will destroy them,
  before I can get control again.
- I almost killed Adie when she tried to kill him.
- If Koschei hadn't stepped between us and talked me back, I'm not sure what would
  have happened.
- You say that you're all well-armed, well, you're not.
- She looked at Tomoko and her eyes were anguished.
- I am hoping to be able to put the meeting off long enough for it to basically boil
  down to an explanation and maybe an apology, if I can work it right.
- For the moment, though, I have the interface more or less stabilized.
- No, this doesn't count… I am deliberately running hot, because I wanted to think
  clearly for a few minutes.
- No, not now.
- Not yet.
- Susan asked with a laugh.
- I think of what the world must look like if you exist in five dimensions; the Doctor
  described it to me.
- It sounds amazing.
- I was put through the Chameleon Arch when I was sent to safety, I was perfectly
  human for about a year or so, one heart, three dimensions, ask Donna when we get
  back, she can tell you.
- Who I am as a person didn't really change at all when I regained my lost memories
  and abilities, when I re-expanded back to a Time Lord.
- All that changed was my ability to understand things that I didn't as a human.
- This torture resulted in women that hobbled about, their feet forever cramped and
  painful.
- She shook her head.
- It's just… it's such a big change, and there is so much going on right now and I…
  I can't do it and do everything else.
- It's one too many flaming chainsaws.
- We're so close, we're starting to win our freedom, it's all I've dreamed about…
  we're just… we're too close now.
- Susan grinned at her.
- I mean, people tend to like me, it's just part of being of the Line, we're charming,
  nice, and friendly...
- except for Great Uncle Brax, he was just a jerk.
- But, it's still been a challenge to find people who don't think I'm...
- Neither fish nor fowl, that's me.
- Not human enough for humans and not Time Lord enough for Time Lords, raised everywhere
  and nowhere, with no fixed point of abode for most of my life.
- I have never had the chance to get along with anyone before.
- You know, Grandfather thinks you would do well working with Dar and the more I see
  of you, the more I think he's right.
- When she blinked, her eyes were back into their proper alignment, but very definitely
  dilated.
- Susan took off her coat and gave Tomoko a wry smile.
- Grandfather thought it was...
- Rose was still curled up in her chair and Koschei was feeling a bit worried about
  her.
- She might have been mostly healed, but her injury had been damn near permanently
  fatal.
- Susan had gone back to work and he could feel the gentle hum of her mind in his,
  though, he realized, he could also hear the echo of Guinn working as well.
- If not, we could use the time it will take to repair Susan's TARDIS to bust into
  the other loops, and pick up the other Mashas, if you wanted.
- the Doctor grumbled.
- He stared at the screen.
- The girls all stopped and looked around.
- They could see her.
- We don't have a lot of time and there's a lot of information we need to get to.
- Most of it he already knew, but the Lens stuff was interesting.
- A sort of frisson went around them.
- We're not killing him.
- We're not even hurting him.
- We are keeping our hands off.
- There was a lot of shouting.
- Faces turned to look at him and he looked back at them.
- he asked, looking around at them all and they gazed back, many of them looking bitter
  and angry, others just looking like they wanted to cry.
- You want justice?
- You want to punish him?
- I understand that.
- I've been here for only two years and I want to kick someone hard!
- The thing is, I want you all to get out of here a lot more than I want revenge.
- You want freedom, right?
- You want out of these hell holes and to live somewhere where you aren't fighting
  to survive every moment?
- Well, here it is.
- You've all spent centuries trapped in here, not able to stop the horrors around
  you, not able to change anything.
- Now's your chance.
- You want to save lives?
- You want to help people?
- You've all told me how hard it was to watch people dying, over and over, with no
  way to prevent it, or change it.
- Now you can change it.
- So, do you want that more than you want to kill one man?
- Who are you going to choose to be?
- Are you going to be the people who sacrificed all life everywhere for your vengeance,
  or the people who chose life over death, helping over harming?
- He can never touch us again.
- He can never hurt us again.
- Now it is time to let go of him and move on with claiming our lives and dealing
  with the Manifold.
- Finally she pulled off her glove to show her number, and held up her hand, the first
  of all of them to do so.
- A few more followed, until the vast majority of them were holding up their hands,
  displaying their numbers.
- There were a few uncomfortable minutes where a couple of the holdouts grumbled rather
  tearfully, but at last everyone was holding their hands up.
- he cried.
- It was pretty rough at first, but then it seemed to catch on.
- It was silly, he knew, but the Doctor hated waiting, he would get manic and nervous
  and pace.
- Rose was sitting nearby, her back to the wall, working on the equations for the
  Lens.
- Rose grinned at him from over her notepad and he snorted.
- For all that Theta was his oldest and dearest friend, he was deeply grateful for
  Rose Tyler.
- She was his friend as well and she had a deep appreciation for the problems of 'managing'
  the Doctor, so he felt as though he had an ally when dealing with him.
- The Doctor grinned at him.
- Look at you al!
- You're all so very different!
- The Doctor said, grinning and the girls and then hugging Jake and Diana hard.
- She asked him.
- It was hard, because he could see suspicion and wariness in some of them, but he
  tried anyway.
- a Masha asked him.
- he replied, a bit taken aback.
- She nodded, still teary-eyed.
- He had had no idea that his other self had made something of this sort.
- It was white and the fabric was marked in hexagons.
- It had a helmet and gloves.
- It could render the wearer all but invisible and was rated for deep space work.
- They would be perfect for the Mashas to wear, as they would have to be outside the
  TARDIS when the lens was fired and the likelihood was that they would be fighting
  the bug outside of atmosphere.
- The pattern was stored exactly where he would have put it and he added some base
  stock and set it to replicate, while he ransacked Guinn's computers for the original
  design.
- The vast wasteland around her was empty of everything, but the glinting silver insects.
- Moira, Devorah, and Madison flanked it moving together weapons at the ready and
  faces tense.
- She took them on because they were both, in their own ways, utterly mad.
- She pulled out her sandgun and put it in the creature's face.
- She turned and there was a wasp, about the size of the beetles, tilting its head
  back and forth in a rhythm.
- She pointed her blaster at its head, but then her eyes glazed over.
- Tomoko's voice broke in on the radio, knowing that they were listening in on the
  console.
- Zoi's voice crackled from the radio.
- From her belt pouch she pulled an odd looking grenade.
- There was a flash when it burst, and then everything was in motion.
- There were holes in hands and missing fingers.
- Four of the girls were so covered in silver goop they were all but suffocating in
  it, unable to get it off of themselves.
- Two of them had had such serious holes put in them that they were unconscious.
- Zoi had been blinded and Evie's arm had broken at a bad angle, then healed.
- She triaged the worst injuries first and forced herself not to think about the War.
- Highly toxic and almost virulent in nature, it was all but impossible to get off.
- It refused to scrape, resisted solvents, wanted very much to soak into tender tissue
  to work its mischief.
- She had been hanging out in the medi-bay for hours, alternating between staying
  out of the way and helping where she could.
- Tomoko turned and put her hand on Jake's shoulder.
- I need bug bait.
- She jerked her head towards medi-bay.
- he suggested.
- He closed his eyes, thinking hard.
- She gave him a piercing look.
- towing the float cart behind them.
- Tomoko looked around until she found it again, all alone, happily munching on a
  pebble.
- Then all at once they go mad, and fly at anything that moves.
- I know that's not random behaviour.
- Energy sources?
- Active sensors?
- Telepathy?
- Or several of those things in conjunction?
- She threw an old rusted nut on the ground, and put her hand next to it.
- Let's put out our bug chow and keep watching them.
- Tomoko said, playing with the data on her tablet.
- Even close up, individually, they really are lovely.
- Looking right past it.
- But it's there, I know it, like catching a glimpse of something out of the corner
  of your eye.
- We voted and everyone promised.
- she asked Koschei and he nodded and left the room.
- He was utterly terrified, but he had been growing lonely and rather maudlin, all
  alone in Susan's TARDIS.
- Susan ran to him and wrapped her arms around him, holding him and his tense fearful
  body started to relax a bit.
- Looking at them, he was struck again by how tiny they were, all about five foot
  four or thereabouts and so very young looking.
- All of the faces looked angry.
- Several of the Mashas were blocking the hallway, because that was where they had
  been standing when Guinn had come in.
- If I could go back and fix everything that went wrong, I would, but time travel
  doesn't work like that.
- It was you, Amy, and me, from summers in the tree house on through the parties in
  college.
- We were an inseparable trio, weren't we?
- Those were good times.
- There are going to be times when I don't know you and I won't be sure that I can
  trust you.
- The doctors said I will be free to leave in a few days.
- I'm not sure where I will go, but apparently an account with a very generous balance
  has been set up in my name.
- That was the Doctor's doing, right?
- Thank him for me.
- I'm a sociopath, Rory.
- I used you and Amy to get to the Doctor so I could kill him.
- Of course, I had fun with you both when we were children, but I always had the plan
  in mind.
- The problem is, I can't remember where I got that plan or how I knew you were my
  parents.
- I thought they dumped me in an orphanage when they discovered I was a regenerative
  freak with two hearts.
- But you lost me?
- And I certainly don't deserve the Doctor's love or forgiveness.
- But apparently you all love me anyway.
- That's amazing.
- I don't even know what name to sign at the bottom!
- Melody?
- Mels?
- an energy couplet?
- A battery?
- A paperweight?'
- He turned it over in his hand.
- ! '''A bomb?'
- It clicked and he frowned, not understanding.
- It was called a Pizza, actually, making the translation a little awry when it came
  to attempting to order an actual pizza in an Ylurtian food market.
- It was the first time in a while he'd had some time to himself, trying to keep up
  with everything that was happening.
- Clara was all through time, saving his back at every turn.
- It has some sort of hypnotic property, he had told him.
- The sides could slide, but only in certain directions, and those directions seemed
  to be changed at random.
- ! 'It had Gallifreyan symbols on some of the sides, but seeing as they overlapped
  it was difficult to try and read, but he did manage to catch two words: home and
  contain.'
- It was mainly a tourist attraction, though the outlawing of anyone actually going
  within seeing distance of any cave meant that interest had slowly died down over
  the years.
- The one thing he had always been, but always in a superior kind of way.
- V.I.P.
- But now, now he was just on holiday.
- He was one of them.
- A tourist.
- Or universe...
- After all, he did get to see things no one else in history would experience.
- He had been to so many places, so many times.
- All through history, his face is stamped.
- It showed the rusted mound of earth that shaped the cave, which, according to the
  leaflet, was about eight feet tall.
- He knew that it was a property of the cave, somehow.
- It was a mysterious piece of TimeLord tech that seemed to be an explosive, planted
  in his TARDIS.
- On Gug?
- The Doctor sprinted after it, focusing on the sound of the voice, even if it didn't
  sound particularly scared.
- In fact, it sounded only a little worried.
- It was like there was a person round the next corner, but the corner never came.
- for all he knew, there could be Angels surrounding him, waiting for him, watching
  and enjoying his obliviousness to them.
- It had moved away from cries of words now, he noticed.
- No more 'help me', just moans of, it seemed, loneliness.
- There's only so much time a person can last without food or water before they die,
  and there didn't seem to be any sustenance of any kind down here.
- That meant whoever was down here had been here a while, but not too long.
- With supplies, they maybe last a few weeks down here.
- Without, a few days.
- the Doctor asked the air.
- For all he knew, he was at a dead-end, and he wouldn't know it.
- It could close of behind him, shutting him inside a rocky tomb.
- It hadn't.
- No one had ever got out of here, why did he think he was any different?
- He could hear those sounds, too, as well as some odd throbbing-type noise.
- He knew it wasn't a mistake - something was interfereing with his screwdriver.
- And, at that, how likely it was that the trap had something to do with the interference.
- High, he found.
- Great.
- Cryptic calls in the dark.
- he responded, smiling a little.
- Best to be optimistic.
- Ever the optimist.
- And it had a stupid, immature sense of humour that lead to him receiving the most
  convoluted, backwards plotlines he could think up.
- Doom and riches.
- Darkness and light.
- It was as though the column was a huge crystal, bursting from the earth and leading
  out through the ceiling.
- An actual TARDIS.
- he breathed, walking towards the crystal pillar of light.
- He didn't care.
- Nothing mattered.
- This was a TARDIS.
- That meant TimeLords...
- maybe someone crashed.
- This place, it was a tomb.
- Nothing can escape.
- They never came to find him because they couldn't.
- He snapped himself out of it, shaking his head and looking away.
- It was hypnotising.
- What the hell did this mean?
- Another TARDIS, just out here.
- Waiting.
- ! '''But-'' he suddenly started to look incredibly scared.'
- What does it mean?'
- He trusted the Doctor instantly, as though he had never seen another person.
- ! '''This,'' he thrust a small box with a green sigil the Doctor didn''t recognise
  into the Doctor''s waist.'
- the boy asked.
- the Doctor genuinely didn't know.
- He had no idea if he could get out.
- Although, now he knew this was a TARDIS, albeit a faulty one, he knew he could navigate
  it a little better.
- This wasn't his TARDIS, so it wasn't broadcasting information into him, but it was
  this person's...
- was this boy like him?
- he said, shaking his head.
- ! '''I don''t know what I am or who I am or who you are but you are important.'
- You and that box are connected, I know it.
- Apparently he's connected to a box.
- ! '''So...'
- he asked, still looking.
- ! '''Looks Time Lord-y.'
- yes...'
- the boy shook his head, angry at himself.
- ow, I don't know...
- ! '''It''s okay.'
- Dangerous box, things coming for us and a possible TimeLord in a faulty TARDIS...
- He circled the crystal pillar, bathing in the blue light and inspecting the console,
  making some sense of the controls.
- It didn't help that every time the TARDIS regenerated, it's control panel swapped
  around, almost seeming to avoid being understood for too long.
- the boy asked, suddenly challenging him.
- ! '''Why is it your place to say so?'
- What's your authority?!'
- he screamed, the sound echoing around the huge room, surrounding them.
- PTSD, probably from the Time War.
- Which means, well a lot of things.
- A Way out.
- A leak.
- Or a different war...
- this could have been here for hundreds of years, the TARDIS keeping him alive.
- The Doctor really didn't like that thought, but he couldn't be sure of anything.
- It was impossible, anyway.
- The Time War was Timelocked - the operative bit being 'locked'.
- No way in or out.
- ! '''One of the greatest ships ever.'
- planets and stars.
- He helped the boy to his feet, holding the box and his screwdriver in his other
  hand.
- ! '''Endless, wonderful life.'
- ! '''Here...'''
- he said, quivering.
- ! '''It wasn''t too long ago I had a look down into my own TARDIS''s matrix.'
- Yes!'
- the Doctor pointed his screwdriver upwards, and the whole cave burst into bright,
  blue light.
- the boy smiled.
- ! '''I can see it...'
- yes.
- I don't want anything.
- I need out.
- Out of here.
- Get me out.
- no you don't.
- On-going memory loss.'
- The Doctor took the box from him and held it up.
- ! '''Very.'
- Don't open it.
- Them.
- My head is hurting, is that right?'
- he said, shaking his head.
- He hit his own temple, dazing himself slightly.
- Did he have memory-loss?
- He couldn't remember telling this boy his name, but this teenager couldn't remember
  him arriving at all.
- The TARDIS was slightly psychic, after all.
- Now, in the light, the area seemed fairly safe, if indeed the things in the dark
  stuck to the shadows.
- The boy noticed instantly, his paranoia of the dark kicking in.
- The Doctor, however, was too busy building a mental map - storing every turn, the
  distances, the doorways they passed but never entered.
- He was working out the layout.
- He wanted to get to somewhere there was a fault, so he scanned every inch of the
  walls as they passed them, zeroing in on the problem.
- The entire corridor behind them had shut down, dipped in black paint.
- ! '''It can play with your head.'
- the boy said.
- ! '''That''s your name...'
- isn't it?
- said the shadow, mocking him.
- he asked, looking directly into the shadow.
- He could almost see a face, hidden behind the cloak of darkness.
- The voice wasn't male or female, threatening or kind.
- It was just there.
- Everywhere.
- If he could get it to talk, he might learn something about these shadows.
- Talking shadows.
- Deja Vu.
- ! '''Only, she said it was sad.'
- ! '''You''re alive.'
- You're the fault.
- A cancer, maybe?
- ! '''You just wanted me to believe anything I said.'
- Make up my own lie.
- Truth is, you don't know what you are, because it hasn't told you.
- You are the TARDIS.
- This cave-like, living TARDIS created you.
- I don't know why it did.
- I don't know if there is a reason.
- But I do know one thing, and that's that there is something down here.
- In this ship.
- Eating away.
- And I'm going to fix it, because that's who I am.
- I'm the Doctor.
- Every motion, every twitch at the corner of his mouth was a new, exciting thought.
- A new connection.
- ! '''To shut us out.'
- the boy whimpered, taking that box from the Doctor.
- The TARDIS, it exists in two separate dimensions.
- The door is the bridge between them.
- That's where the fault is.
- A cave that let you in, but not out.
- That was the doorway.
- It's cracked, broken.
- He felt it.
- ! '''Now the lights are out.'
- You would have to pass through me, and while you might, Doctor, your young friend
  would never.
- ! '''I am scared.'''
- He swallowed.
- ! '''But I''m brave.'
- I think.
- I don't know.
- You stole my memories from my head.
- he exploded, arms thrown out, lashing through the shadows, scratching at them.
- It did something the boy couldn't do.
- Something this cave seemed to have swallowed along with all those poor souls.
- Simuss.
- He knew that name.
- It was his.
- The Doctor looked back and saw him, static in his spot, staring at his own hands.
- He had no idea.
- Blank face, expectant eyes and quivering mouth.
- He needed to know.
- You're a...'
- That's why he had never been felt, no other Time Lord had ever been found.
- Locked away.
- Simuss asked.
- ! '''That sounds important...'''
- he didn't sound happy, nor was he upset.
- The Doctor.
- Handyman of the universe.
- It was nothing.
- He came here on a whim.
- A tourist trip.
- This shouldn't have happened, yet it had.
- This TARDIS, it would have been on Gallifrey at some point.
- That boy would have touched the Citadel, walked its halls, obeyed its rules.
- He was in control.
- ! '''I wish I could ask you how you got here, if this is your TARDIS or someone
  elses.'
- If there were others.
- TARDIS ships were meant for several pilots, after all.
- I want to ask you everything you know, but I can't.
- We fix this TARDIS.
- A little do-er-up-er and she'll be good as new.
- The shadows are threats, nothing more.
- I've stopped caring.
- I just want to get out.
- Chances are we'll find out at some point what the reason is that this TARDIS wants
  us to stay.
- Something else plaguing him.
- Hell, he'd only met him ten minutes ago, but he was already helping in ways he could
  have never have hoped for alone.
- He was alone, truly alone.
- Something he wasn't being told.
- This mad, sprinting man didn't seem the type to just leave.
- To figure out something halfway, then find a present and just run off with it.
- From what he'd seen, Simuss knew this much - the Doctor wanted to help.
- But to what extent?
- Would he just be happy with getting him out and leaving, or would he come back to
  sort out this ship?
- Perhaps the Doctor was slightly lost in the happy fuzz of finding kin.
- It was ridiculous, he thought, that he hadn't thought of it.
- He'd been distracted, of course, but still.
- No change.
- No lights going out.
- Maybe the Doctor was better at thinking when he was silent.
- Either that or he was trying not to think at all, trying not to over-complicate
  it.
- If he really was as lonely as Simuss thought, then maybe he just wanted to revel
  in this moment.
- To feel brotherhood and only brotherhood.
- ! '''You don''t think it''s any good, do you.'
- Simuss' voice was high, on the edge of panicking.
- He was doing a rather incredible job of keeping it together, the Doctor realised.
- Arms swinging, he couldn't find anything in the dark.
- the shadows asked, their voices dark and full of knowledge, despite asking questions.
- ! '''He''s a genocidal, lonely God who picks up poor humans and drops them when
  he''s sucked them dry.'
- The shadows were real, living creatures.
- Physical, not spectral.
- Really, nothing.
- I said 'maybe' hoping an idea would come to me, Doctor, because I'm really scared
  and probably mentally compromised.
- I have memories loss and I'm not human even though I feel like I should be.
- Would he have to tell Simuss about the War?
- Was that something he could do.
- Simuss, being here, must have been from before the Time War began, meaning he has
  no idea what happened.
- Was it smart to do that to another person?
- ! '''In a war.'
- Maybe he would be able to cope.
- They sat together, in the new light.
- ! '''Burning, stinking hell.'''
- He took a deep breath, his brow low over his eyes and his hair hanging, devoid of
  it's usual bounce from sweat.
- ! '''I ended it,'' he said.'
- Every Time lord.
- Me and you, we're the last.
- No one else.
- Professor River song.
- Archeologist.
- She died.
- I watched.
- Everyone seems to do that, but hey, everything ends.
- That's how the universe works, isn't it.
- Everything dies.
- The Doctor took a heavy breath and stood up, helping simuss to his own feet.
- ! '''Try to make a difference.'
- Do good.
- Yesterday I was just in a cave, lost next to a glowing pillar.
- Without a name or a friend or a species.
- Now, however, they saw the shadows in the corner - one of the the corridors heading
  away from the console was drenched in darkness.
- the Doctor asked the shadows.
- He didn't look at them, however.
- ! '''I have been here for a long while.'
- the Doctor asked.
- ! '''A minute ago you were calling me genocidal.'
- I take offence to that, plus it kind of implies you don't like me.
- Rude, by the way.
- The only fault is life, but it is not my place to determine how people live.
- Life is so easily misspent, especially down here.
- Watch the universe in all it's perfections.
- Simuss asked.
- it said, actually sounding offended.
- What happened to them?!'
- ! '''It tells us everything.'
- What happened to them.
- What happened to me.
- Simuss screamed, demanding an answer.
- the shadows asked, turning the tide.
- It's ambiguous, androgynous voice had an authority that made it difficult for Simuss
  to hold his own, but he tried.
- ! '''First, you tell us where they went.'
- What happened to them.
- it roared.
- ! '''We did nothing to them.'
- We watched you become more...
- this place, the Doctor calls it a TARDIS, it is what attacked them.
- Simuss was quiet now, no longer in a yelling match.
- He was thinking.
- He wanted all the answers.
- For so long, he was in the dark, hopeless.
- Now the Doctor had shown him light, he was greedy for it and he didn't care.
- He wanted to know.
- ! '''The first was to find the Doctor.'
- His name rang in our ears before we had opened our eyes.
- Doctor.
- It should not be opened, not until the right time.
- It is not ready yet.
- ! '''We are, in some way linked to that box.'
- Whatever is inside, it cannot act on it's own.
- ! '''Only ever humans.'
- ! '''Subtly, but there was always something.'
- Pulling me into the dark.
- Simuss asked, softer now.
- The TARDIS, it would attack them, and they would emerge.
- New.
- oh,' the Doctor nodded, hand closing over his mouth.
- ! '''Oh...'''
- he looked at Simuss, a quizzical look.
- Simuss asked.
- ! '''That I''m a Time Lord?'
- Why am I a Time Lord if they were all human.
- ! '''I''ve used one before.'
- Once.
- To become human.
- ! '''I''m human?'''
- ! '''For some reason, whatever is in this box was luring in humans and changing
  them into Time Lords and then...'
- ! '''Someone created Time Lords, that''s impossible.'
- It is completely not possible.
- Simuss asked.
- Humans and Time Lords share lineage, were' like cousin species.
- We're the older cousin, we came first, so becoming human is like winding forward
  the clock, pushing evolution in a specific direction within parameters that are
  set by biology.
- But going backwards in evolution only ever results in -' He stopped dead.
- ! '''Wait...'
- wait, while I was human my consciousness was locked inside a watch.
- A little fob watch.'
- The Doctor span to the shadows, accusingly.
- This needs locked up.
- There would be somewhere else- but no.
- I could save them, turn them back into humans, turn on the light and fix this door
  and we'd all be okay.
- Give them back their memories, their lives.
- Whatever it is, it locked them in with it.
- That's why you knew my name, shadows.
- Whatever is in here, it knows me.
- It knows I could figure it out.
- All of this.
- Figure out that the only way to save them is to let it out.
- What's the point in trapping yourself in a box.
- It found some leakage, a way to control the TARDIS, psychically.
- It's strong enough mentally to literally create creatures of shadow to do it's bidding.
- ! '''It''s the only way to save all those people, somewhere down in the caves.'
- Simuss asked, his brow furrowed and his arms crossed.
- the Doctor asked.
- ! '''All those human little experiences.'
- First kiss, first dance, going to school, getting bullied, falling in love.
- Is it worth it?
- Letting out whatever's in there, it could be disastrous.
- It knows you, Doctor.
- You and your ship and your life, it knows.
- That means you've seen it before, but you didn't kill it or stop it.
- You don't know how it got in there - someone else trapped it.
- Doesn't mean I do.
- There are no inscriptions on this thing.
- If it's Time Lord, that would explain the TARDIS, but it might not be.
- This TARDIS might have been used to ship this thing, nothing more.
- It's an old model, it was probably stolen.
- Transport, nothing more.
- Whoever built this didn't want us knowing.
- The Doctor lowered the box from his gaze.
- you know.
- Big threat, you're part of the monster.
- For the shadows.
- For you, Simuss.
- ! '''They could have survived without food if they were Time Lord.'
- Bigger reserves.
- It was only discovered a few years ago.
- the Doctor asked, pointing directly at Simuss's forehead.
- ! '''Your memory.'
- You didn't remember your own first name half an hour ago, but now it's all 'a few
  years ago' and 'people'.
- You're getting them back.
- ! '''It''s the box.'
- It's showing that it has the power to give back the memories, giving you snippets
  of your own life.
- It was tough, wood-like to look at, but it felt almost like leather.
- There must have been at least thirty time-faces, all embedded in the odd wood-leather,
  pouring out this stained light.
- It disappeared down the caverns, different streams taking different routes, each
  searching for it's own host.
- He collapsed to the floor, hitting his head and falling asleep, and yet the light
  still poured into him.
- A darker, emerald shade of light that echoed the lime green clasp on the box, but
  it was tainted with black and grey, making it seem dirty.
- It dominated the space around it, eating it and consuming it.
- They arose together, seeing the plain of bodies, shifting as their brains attempted
  to figure out the memories, as their bodies shape back into their original species.
- The Doctor did the same for an old man to his left, then a young man a little further
  out.
- Soon enough they were helping each other up, and the Doctor quickly realised that
  they were looking to him for information.
- He didn't know why, and he presumed that they didn't either.
- People, in times of trouble, just seem to look to the person they think might know
  something - out of trust or suspicion.
- More than he had expected, and after a while they were all staring at him.
- The funny man in the bow tie with floppy hair.
- he said, slapping a smile upon his own face.
- The Doctor pointed and smiled.
- ! '''I''m guessing we''re all explorers.'
- ! '''But you''ll have to bear with me.'
- ! '''Which is odd.'
- I'm a traveller.
- I've seen a lot of boxes, but this one was different.
- the Doctor muttered.
- He quickly shook his head, snapping out of it.
- ! '''Look, you were changed, your memories were wiped and then I fixed it, but to
  fix it and save you and your memories, I had to open the box.'
- asked a woman.
- She looked outwards, into the desert - it was almost flat.
- ! '''It wasn''t really a cave, it was a ship.'
- He smiled.
- you let it out?'
- Don't get me started, I know, it's all 'was that the right choice' or 'pros versus
  cons'.
- ! '''Then me and Simuss, if he''s willing, will travel to the 21st century to pick
  up a friend of mine, Clara.'
- ! '''We''re tracking the TARDIS.'''
- He straightened up and addressed the group of Humans.
- ! '''My ship, my own TARDIS is back in the town, over there,'' he said, pointing
  to a barely visible group of buildings off in the distance.'
- ! '''It can go anywhere, anywhen.'
- I'll take you all home.
- a man asked.
- ! '''I''ve been in that cave for weeks.'
- What do I say to my family?
- ! '''I guess we''ll find out.'
- Gus, the sun, hung high in the sky - it was nowhere hear morning nor night.
- The town's shadow was short and sharp, and as the group of fifty stepped into the
  shade they felt the temperature drop.
- It didn't feel completely natural, that kind of drop in temperature.
- The Doctor had experienced it before, many times; when a planet or moon is exposed
  on one side to the sun more than the other, it starts to scorch the surface.
- Now the dirt of Gug was starting to burn.
- Harper yelled as he disappeared into a building.
- FIghting and rowing, all vocal.
- Then there was a fist.
- ! '''Everyone, please.'
- Now.
- One hundred watchful, impatient eyes.
- Don't function well on my own.
- I tend to get...
- asked Harper.
- Moving on.
- ! '''Now, once we''re back, you''re going to take me, my friend Clara and Simuss
  around this town and show us the last place you saw your families, friends, anyone
  you came with.'
- People are disappearing.
- Harper yelled, getting aggressive.
- Humans.
- So sentimental.
- someone yelled.
- It was a woman, in her thirties, with a thin face and intrusive eyes.
- ! '''We don''t know if you''re coming back.'
- the Doctor said.
- Harper scowled.
- ! '''Simuss, you stay here and keep everyone comfortable.'
- They watched him with eagle eyes that made the Doctor feel almost sorry for leaving
  him.
- This is what I do.
- Lately, I'll be honest, it's been a lot of people going missing.
- I figured that they were all in the caves, but it seems there's a new dimension
  to this mystery.
- Heh.'
- He laughed at his little 'dimension' joke, fully knowing that no-one would either
  get it nor care.
- Harper asked as he and the Doctor moved through the town towards his own, lovely
  TARDIS.
- Or they were told to...'
- he started to think.
- he asked.
- ! '''Although it doesn''t make that much sense.'
- New things reveal themselves around every corner.
- Every turn is a new clue.
- ! '''Anyway, have a look inside.'
- ! '''It says pull to open,'' he said.'
- said Harper, thinking.
- He was pulling it apart, in his head, breaking it down.
- ! '''New dimension.'
- ! '''Right then.'
- Harper asked, looking confused.
- ! '''What are you talking about?'
- ! '''Handy as hell.'
- I'll go and pick up Clara, we'll only be gone a few seconds to Gug, but for us it
  could be minutes.'
- He started dancing around the console, flicking switches and hitting buttons.
- ! '''To sum it up, yeah.'
- Harper cut out the middleman and lay back down, closing his eyes.
- He hated flying anyway.
- She'd missed this.
- She knew it was needed, her break from it all.
- one of the crowd yelled.
- ! '''We bloody well have!'
- ! '''I did take Harper.'
- He watched.
- ! '''That''s the angry mob, Harper''s behind you and everyone else is missing.'
- Fifty of them, falling silent in front of them.
- They're right, I know things they don't, but I've told them everything about this
  that I do.
- They know what I know.
- So.
- Any ideas?
- Tell me.
- ! '''You said that the green...'
- thing.
- In the cave.
- It changed us to a different species.
- Harper asked.
- ! '''Would it take my family?'
- Is there any other reason someone would want...
- ! '''And that''s what I was thinking.'
- Very good Harper.
- Like I said.
- Just saying.
- Clara.
- It was a fun look, with a hint of frustration.
- ! '''I''m going to leave now.'
- I'm not your boss, you can do whatever you want, but if you go home your families
  will turn up there.
- I guess you'll just have to stay then,' the Doctor said.
- ! '''Harper, look.'
- I have been doing this just about all of my adult life.
- I'm over a thousand years old.
- I have a few centuries of experience behind me.
- I'm clever and good and reliable and I would never let a creature like this take
  people.
- Simple take them.
- It's madness!
- and you don't trust me because you're scared and human and that's fine, it really
  is.
- And I'll be back,' he said as he and Clara stepped away, back towards the TARDIS.
- ! '''Best thing we can do is try and chase down that TARDIS.'
- Clara asked.
- He stopped.
- Easy to find.
- One long, streak of old Artron energy from the TARDIS that doesn't match this one.
- I'll start scanning now,' he smiled as he bounced a button.
- Clara asked.
- Don't you see?!'
- The Doctor looked at them, expecting a response.
- When they didn't give any, he didn't sag, as Clara had been expecting.
- Instead, his face lit up and he brightened, relishing the chance to explain himself.
- ! '''We''re inside a TARDIS!'''
- ! '''Not this one.'
- A big one.
- where's home?'
- It did it again...
- inside a TARDIS, the person at the console has a lot of control over what goes on
  inside.
- Whatever it was inside that box, it used the TARDIS to swallow this moon.
- We can get out.
- We'll have a little trouble, but I have a lever I installed incase of this.
- Of course, last time it was my own TARDIS getting trapped inside itself, but that
  doesn't matter.
- We can get out, in this.
- ! '''They''re telling me the TARDIS that green thing stole is all around us.'
- Everywhere.
- More of a big box, really.
- Now, onto saving those lost tourists of Gug.'
- The Doctor hit a few buttons and pressed a few buttons, grinning.
- room?
- What?
- I'm lost.
- Sorry.'
- It's a simulation, the space around it, keeping it suspended.
- Tricky thing with TARDIS technology - they get pretty big pretty fast.
- If you leave a TARDIS in the same place, once it gets damaged, it'll start to leak.
- It'll grow.
- he demonstrated with his hands, trying to make a box and then blow it up, until
  it encase him.
- Let out Gug.
- And what does that imply?
- The Doctor beamed at them.
- ! '''They change!'
- We have to change the green figure, make it less...
- Talking to it?
- I don't know.
- ! '''We''re in a still room.'
- nothing to do with this.
- Clara asked.
- I just feel like we need,' he smashed the console, smiling, 'a little perspective
  on things.
- Console room of a mini-galaxy-sized TARDIS.
- The curves and angles of the central console slid into the floor, forming a sphere
  of glass in the centre that stretched up to a high ceiling that curved in such a
  way that it was difficult to tell how high it was exactly.
- As his hand traced across the shining material, lights of a soft, light blue started
  to appear under his fingers, squares and circles glowing, fading slowly as he moved.
- The blue lights echoed his hands, following his movements.
- ! '''This is fascinating.'
- The creature, the thing in green, it's not physical so it doesn't need physical
  controls.
- It revamped its entire operating system for us.
- Wonder how that happened...'
- he looked at his own TARDIS, blue and beautiful, and it clicked suddenly.
- Her!'
- Clara asked, walking towards the blue box.
- ! '''Eh?'
- Well, apparently.
- I mean, she hasn't met another TARDIS in a while, must be nice to meet your kin
  after hundreds of years.
- But flirting?!'
- He looked to Clara, standing by her.
- ! '''Girl''s gotta flirt.'
- He thought.
- ! '''I suppose I am, actually.'
- Nice one, girl.
- Clara laughed.
- he looked himself up and down.
- the green figure watched him.
- it said, also sounding offended.
- ! '''So, then, who are you.'
- And please don't say we're going to do the guessing game.
- I've done that far too much.
- I know exactly how old you are.
- Who are you.
- Great.
- A 'master-plan' guy.
- You're all so full of yourselves.
- Well, not yet.
- The Master tried it, kind of.
- This one's taking a different route.
- Her eyes faltered, and she looked to Simuss.
- She thought he might feel the same.
- Simuss asked under his breath.
- ! '''I''ve seen your life.'
- In spectral form, yes, but true Time Lord.
- Not half-human, not a metacrisis.
- Just Time Lord.
- Look what happened to them.
- They're always murderers, killers, wanting to be supreme.
- That was the Master's problem, Rassilon's problem.
- To the species.
- To be all 'high and mighty', to feel like we can just observe all of that pain and
  feel nothing.
- Well, I started feeling the pain, so I joined in.
- Fought in wars, killed people, watched them kill themselves.
- For me.
- I wanted power.
- I wanted to be powerful.
- You're not.
- We've been through this.
- Doctor.
- And plus, beyond that.
- ! '''They were all killers.'
- In the end.
- They murdered and slaughtered and I was the last one standing.
- It's coming back, all of it.
- I don't block it out, but some days I manage to tell myself 'it was for the best'.
- Everything that has happened, it's all okay because I'm still fighting.
- But that's just it.
- I'm still a warrior.
- How often do you meet people who are someone else's worst nightmare?
- ! '''I''ve just met you, and I can say now, you aren''t like that one.'
- Time Lords, humans, it's all the same.
- Some are good.
- Eh?
- Is a murderer good?
- We're arguing over my ego when there's a Time Lord out there experimenting on innocent
  Humans, trying to make them into Time Lords.
- The Chameleon Arch isn't exactly a forgiving piece of kit.
- It almost resembles a...
- Two of them...
- There isn't a way out, so the radiation shouldn't have made it out.
- He paused, thinking.
- Clara and Simuss didn't want to interrupt him.
- ! '''Pure energy.'
- A human isn't supposed to become Time Lord, it doesn't work that way.
- If the figure tries it on all of those people, I don't want to think about what
  might happen to them.
- The Doctor turned and bolted into his own TARDIS, stroking the wood as he passed.
- He liked being back where he knew how everything worked.
- This had upset the Doctor, made him angry and sad and motivated.
- All because of a little rock somewhere in the cosmos.
- What's more, she wondered how all of this had gone on under his nose, for so long
  until he'd come along, saved everyone he could, and unleashed this new threat upon
  everyone.
- If that made sense.
- He did that, missed the obvious because he was so lost in the fascinating complexity
  of it all.
- He was uneasy, now.
- His hands were tense and his brow had a sheen of sweat, glimmering slightly as he
  waited for the TARDIS to land.
- He had no idea what was outside of that door.
- The Doctor, Simuss and Clara all looked at each other, waiting to see if they were
  all ready.
- They all moved at once.
- Not like this.
- This wasn't right.
- And by huge, it wasn't, like, concert-hall huge.
- ! '''It had the small cave one attached to it, but Gug is just one huge TARDIS.'
- ! '''Does that mean that the green figure has been in there all this time?'
- The room was the size of a small planet - the false gravity resulting in them being
  at what was the bottom of a huge ball, on the inside.
- From the Doctor's lack of a response, she summised it was probably important.
- This place had actually rendered him to not wanting to think about it.
- It couldn't be.
- Back before the war, when they were just setting off.
- She was the reason she started, really.
- Got him off the planet.
- He took her to learn, to experience new worlds.
- She looked like a picture.
- A memory.
- ! '''Just a memory, I mean.'
- I'm not- well, I'm dead.
- I'm sorry, Grandfather.
- He just looked at her.
- They stood, silent for a moment in the hollow moon.
- ! '''It''s mine,'' she said eventually.'
- ! '''The TARDIS.'
- Took a leaf out of your book when the war started.
- I tried to run.
- He coughed.
- Her image flickered and it struck the Doctor like a slap to the face.
- What about you?'
- He looked up to her.
- ! '''You''re a projection.'
- I didn't look like this when I died, but it's the best way to talk to you.
- When Rassilon tried to bring Gallifrey to the Earth, I was there.
- I warned Wilfred Mott, with a few others.
- We revolted against Rassilon in the final days.
- The Master assisted us in creating a machine capable of holding it open long enough
  to catapult a TARDIS through.
- This was the first one we sent.
- We sent through mine, but there was something that went wrong...
- My TARDIS wasn't protected like the others.
- It was older...
- I didn't...
- ! '''You did what you should have.'
- It was brave of you to leave a fight like that one.
- I can't believe I'm saying your name.
- You stopped Rassilon, took on the Master as a friend, fought to get out and sacrificed
  your safety to make sure everyone else got out before you did.
- I'm proud.
- This TARDIS, it's sitting on top of the hole in the Time Lock.
- You have to protect it.
- I know nothing other than this place needs to be kept safe and that I love you.
- ! '''It''s you.'
- ! '''I thought you would know me best.'
- Simuss screamed, demanding an answer.
- the shadows asked, turning the tide.
- It's ambiguous, androgynous voice had an authority that made it difficult for Simuss
  to hold his own, but he tried.
- ! '''First, you tell us where they went.'
- What happened to them.
- it roared.
- ! '''We did nothing to them.'
- We watched you become more...
- this place, the Doctor calls it a TARDIS, it is what attacked them.
- Simuss was quiet now, no longer in a yelling match.
- He was thinking.
- He wanted all the answers.
- For so long, he was in the dark, hopeless.
- Now the Doctor had shown him light, he was greedy for it and he didn't care.
- He wanted to know.
- ! '''The first was to find the Doctor.'
- His name rang in our ears before we had opened our eyes.
- Doctor.
- It should not be opened, not until the right time.
- It is not ready yet.
- ! '''We are, in some way linked to that box.'
- Whatever is inside, it cannot act on it's own.
- ! '''Only ever humans.'
- ! '''Subtly, but there was always something.'
- Pulling me into the dark.
- Simuss asked, softer now.
- The TARDIS, it would attack them, and they would emerge.
- New.
- oh,' the Doctor nodded, hand closing over his mouth.
- ! '''Oh...'''
- he looked at Simuss, a quizzical look.
- Simuss asked.
- ! '''That I''m a Time Lord?'
- Why am I a Time Lord if they were all human.
- ! '''I''ve used one before.'
- Once.
- To become human.
- ! '''I''m human?'''
- ! '''For some reason, whatever is in this box was luring in humans and changing
  them into Time Lords and then...'
- ! '''Someone created Time Lords, that''s impossible.'
- It is completely not possible.
- Simuss asked.
- Humans and Time Lords share lineage, were' like cousin species.
- We're the older cousin, we came first, so becoming human is like winding forward
  the clock, pushing evolution in a specific direction within parameters that are
  set by biology.
- But going backwards in evolution only ever results in -' He stopped dead.
- ! '''Wait...'
- wait, while I was human my consciousness was locked inside a watch.
- A little fob watch.'
- The Doctor span to the shadows, accusingly.
- This needs locked up.
- There would be somewhere else- but no.
- I could save them, turn them back into humans, turn on the light and fix this door
  and we'd all be okay.
- Give them back their memories, their lives.
- Whatever it is, it locked them in with it.
- That's why you knew my name, shadows.
- Whatever is in here, it knows me.
- It knows I could figure it out.
- All of this.
- Figure out that the only way to save them is to let it out.
- What's the point in trapping yourself in a box.
- It found some leakage, a way to control the TARDIS, psychically.
- It's strong enough mentally to literally create creatures of shadow to do it's bidding.
- ! '''It''s the only way to save all those people, somewhere down in the caves.'
- Simuss asked.
- Clara asked.
- ! '''We don''t even know- oh.'
- ! '''First, we need to get everyone out.'
- The war must have got to him, plus being stuck here for so long.
- That type of violence, and then all of that time to dwell in it.
- Rotted a little inside that box.
- It's an echo of what a Time-Lord was.
- You hear that, Carl?
- Nothing more than an echo.
- ! '''Mixed with the real Susan''s last thoughts and the TARDIS database...'
- What happened.
- He smiled and pushed a button.
- ! '''Act human.'''
- The blue box encase him, and he quickly stepped back out the front door, smiling
  to them.
- Clara grinned.
- Now, get to it, we need to pull those beams out slowly,' he moved towards the closest
  person, the same woman as last time.
- He was a tall man, with thin legs but strong arms.
- Leaning against the console, head resting against the huge central crystal, he let
  out a breath.
- ! '''I think this is it,'' he said, breathing more heavily now.'
- Carl yelled, astonished.
- ! '''But this is it, brother!'
- Trapped in a bubble.
- Break the bubble, I reckon the War stops.
- ! '''Okay.'
- The Master saved the day.
- But this gives us a clue - if the Master was here all that time ago, then he must
  still be somewhere.
- He can give us a hand seeing as he seems to be all do-gooding now.
- However, before that, back to all of this.
- He told them all about what had happened, that they would have to stay for a little
  while so he could scan them.
- Take people hostage, use the Doctor's compassion against him, all of that.
- It worked.
- ! '''Grandfather.'
- I know what I am.
- Excellent.
- Don't let him back in.
- Set up the security.
- I can do that.
- He swiped his screwdriver across her and smiled.
- Try this,' he said, stepping forward and stroking her arm.
- He could touch her.
- She grinned and wrapped her arms around him, squeezing tight.
- I just pushed it.
- You've done it a thousand times.
- I hate having to reload you.
- I think I've got it.
- A blue line sprouted from the red base, blinking at her.
- ! '''Sycorax,'' she said as clearly as she could.'
- She couldn't feel it at all.
- It was a Sycorax, bone-face and all.
- she squealed.
- ! '''No more memory loss!'
- No pain!
- You want any species in particular?
- I know we lost out TARDIS, but we can still get around.
- I've managed to salvage a few things from our hunts in the past.
- Especially now!
- Look at me, all Sycorax-y, no sides effects.
- It's not like you'd just have to brush past one.
- ! '''What happened to all of our team missions?'
- We had a good thing going.
- We left it behind, Lussi.
- Jaymse thought that maybe something had happened to her, something that made her
  the way she was.
- It wasn't that she was stupid or anything, he just felt that, more often than not,
  she would...
- switch off.
- Stop listening.
- Stop caring.
- Stop understanding.
- She darted off, her small frame disappearing behind a curtain.
- Jaymse sat down into a soft chair that moulded to his shape perfectly.
- Looking up, he saw the curtain between this central room and his bedroom, perfectly
  still, on the right.
- In the centre was the one to Lussi's room, moving slightly after her quick passage
  through.
- morally questionable way of getting their stock once a month - stealing.
- She was a genius, even before everything that happened.
- And Jaymse had always been able to get what he wanted.
- He had a special skill of his own that he wasn't sure Lussi was even aware of.
- If she was, she never mentioned it.
- And if she could get into places, she could take things from them.
- Perhaps she misses it.
- I've finished my list.'
- Explore a world!
- Don't you remember?
- He saved us, and he helped us and we helped him.
- They'd taken some of their TARDIS technology while they could, so they had a doorway
  that seemed to turn black, and then they were opening a door.
- Rain pelted the stalls.
- Creatures of all shapes and sized rushed past without giving a single item a second
  thought.
- It was still a few weeks until Market week.
- she chimed, happily holding her face up to the hard rain.
- ! '''I love it on Roxmanop, plus there''s always something new there.'
- I'm everywhere, anyone.
- Remember?
- Now,' he said as they moved out of the large Market and into the smaller streets
  of this large planet.
- They were in a particularly thick segment of city, where the brown buildings stretched
  up to the sky, but there was always a place for the market.
- Always.
- ! '''Roxmanop.'
- What do you want to do there?
- I hear they're quite spectacular.
- He thought about the beaches of Roxmanop - he'd been there once before, a while
  ago.
- With Lussi.
- She'd loved it, but it was during the phase of her life when her psychological fallout
  was starting to show.
- The creatures there were often too relaxed to be fast-acting, and too happy to be
  suspicious.
- People didn't tend to take their closest and most prized possessions to the beach
  but, hey, it was Lussi's turn to choose, after all.
- She started with her current favourite, the Sycorax, then a Judoon, then a Vespiform
  and a few other less-distinguishable insectoid species.
- Eventually she found herself facing her newest addition to the collection - a Zygon.
- Dangerous things, Zygons.
- In fact, it was the part that made her want to keep on going.
- Not only would it affect her whilst in that form, but it quite often had a over-lap
  effect afterwards, too.
- And, on top of that, the experience of what might happen to her whilst in these
  mindsets could easily shift how she saw the world in her original form.
- All around was the burnt brown sand being dragged by the red seas and creatures
  of all sizes and complexions bathing in the sunlight.
- he looked to where she was pointing, and saw what appeared to be a sentient lump
  of greasy slowly seeping into the sand.
- They had conventions in place, he believed.
- Jaymse grimaced as he approached the Ylgrit'pl.
- It turned to him and, he assumed, smiled.
- the thing rang.
- It's voice was odd, even through the translator Jaymse had installed into his ear.
- ! '''Hawll, Ylgrit''pl.'
- Jaymse asked, hoping it would be that easy.
- He was having trouble keeping his breakfast in his stomach, he didn't want to be
  here long.
- One handshake and a sample would be acquired.
- Hawll asked, looking Jaymse up and down.
- He sniffed.
- ! '''There you go.'
- He only now noticed that she was, indeed, sat on the gem-like pedestal.
- He gave me an address, said to bring the chair.
- It was a 'goodwill gesture' or something.
- Let's just go before that lump of...
- ugh...
- gets up and follows.
- They started walking back towards The Horseman, and Lussi started laughing.
- ! '''I got a chair from a Plothrite.'''
- She laughed again.
- He attempted to ignore the sudden, piercing stench of Lussi's new option, but it
  was all too much.
- That face.
- Lussi, naive as ever, bounced out and into her room to tinker and edit.
- Jaymse, feeling altogether less bouncy, sat and looked over some numbers for the
  stall.
- They had plenty of income, but he was bothered.
- He should have used his gift, but it's not usually so public as it was.
- He doesn't often spend money on food, not for him anyway.
- It wasn't the kind of situation you get out of.
- They'd been silent for so long, keeping their head's down, staying to themselves.
- They'd even managed to stop anyone from finding out about their technology - well,
  there was a slip-up, but it was kept quiet.
- He lazed with his feet up on his new jewel stool, ready to be sold, and read through
  the numbers.
- They had enough money now, he thought.
- They could move on to the next planet with a market, or a city planet.
- Lussi would like the people, he guessed.
- Or maybe she'd enjoy a bit of peace, a little countryside.
- Some trees and fields.
- He couldn't deal with him.
- Not with that part of his past.
- They'd gotten away, they didn't need it coming back.
- He could smell it.
- You know, the way night smells.
- Cold, sharp, but homely.
- His alarm pulsed in his ear, only audible to him.
- Lussi didn't need to know anything.
- He doesn't sleep often anymore - most nights start like this, and end with too much
  of a buzz for him to get any real slumber.
- He couldn't miss an opurtunity like that.
- It was so easy, and fast.
- Modern enough.
- The lights were white, the floor black, silver sweeping structures enveloping the
  walls into a fireplace, a chair, a sofa.
- He sold electronics.
- Very prestigous stuff, too.
- Made him a lot of money.
- A lot more than gemmed trinkets like him and Lussi.
- He was called something stupid.
- It made sense.
- Maybe this was a really bad idea.
- It was.
- The man's daughter.
- She looked six, maybe seven.
- Both of them human.
- It wasn't hard if they were bad people, or even good people with good families.
- But with a daughter like that...
- It reminded him of Lussi.
- Bless her, she wasn't the kind of person who could take care of herself.
- Although he was completely upright, outside and in the dark, he could feel eyes
  on him.
- the cold didn't feel welcoming anymore.
- he whispered.
- ! '''I need to...'''
- He couldn't get it out.
- She was gone.
- The light was off.
- He screamed at himself for getting into this position, where it was one person a
  night.
- A place like this, people go missing all the time, but it would always get out.
- They'd always push it, and have to move.
- It was cold.
- So cold, Jaymse hesitated for a second, considering allowing himself to die.
- What if it all just ended.
- After everything, the wars and the fighting and the escape plans and the pain, it
  could end here.
- It wasn't killing persay, but it was enough to get him and Lussi removed if he was
  caught.
- If he was found here, they'd put the peices together.
- all the mysterious deaths in the area, they'd know it was him.
- Fight the addiction, or give in to it.
- Give in to the power.
- He could never tell her.
- She would hate him so much.
- She would hate everything about him.
- She was so innocent, so full of life - her only wish being to experience life from
  all perspectives, as all life forms.
- He'd blacked out.
- It was day time.
- The Sun.
- Light.
- The Daughter.
- Explain.
- He watched, silent.
- Why was he uncoscious like that?
- Moving was so easy, he was made to move, he had to run, had to think - what had
  happened?
- It was the same night.
- He'd dreamt it.
- He knew he'd killed the man, but he didn't want to drain him dry.
- The man had tried to kill himself, and then he'd taken that in.
- He needed her to be there.
- She had to be there.
- If she wasn't, he had no idea what he'd do - he'd disappointed her.
- She was the last thing he had going for him.
- she cried out, throwing the device aside.
- we were hot, hurt.
- I wasn't.
- You were.
- He was helping us but...
- I'm confused, why are you asking me all of this?'
- Her eyes widened.
- ! '''I feel something.'
- In my head...
- Lussi looked at him, her eyes shining in the light from the main section of the
  tent - she was lost, it seemed.
- Lost inside some memory she wasn't sure she even had.
- Home.
- That's where we come from, the Doctor, me, you, all of us.
- ! '''Horse-people it should be.'
- But that sounds like we look like Horses.
- We Time Lords, Lussi, we have a Hive mind.
- Had.
- It died, along with our world.
- We were supposed to die too, but we got out, remember?
- We cut ourselves off.
- The Doctor went off to fight his fights, and we never saw him again.
- Maybe not.
- Based on some old legend, all across the Universe.
- There are always four, always representing four different aspects of the end of
  times.
- A year or so in one place, then I'd move on to the next.
- Laura White, Lauren White, Laura Waters, Laura Smith...
- I'd been them all.
- It had to be this way...
- Or people would question it.
- Question my age, question my looks.
- I was scared when they did this...
- because I didn't know why.
- I was petrified of what I am, what I could be, because I didn't have a clue.
- No one knew why...
- Even my parents couldn't explain it, because they didn't have a chance.
- My Mother died when I was twenty-three, my father just two years later.
- and there was times when I wanted to die, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
- I'd just move to another place.
- A fresh start each time, new friends, new identity, new house.
- There was no way around it.
- Why I am this?
- for my new readers, if you haven't read Highwayman and Gravity I suggest you go
  read those first before you read this one...cause you'll be lost.
- for my returning readers, welcome back!
- and thank you for keeping up with me!
- Look, I know you're worried about me and him, but two months is nothing, compared
  to the four years I waited for him the first time.
- It was card sized with several stamps, telling her it had been around.
- Tall, dark, handsome, pretty brilliant.
- She couldn't help but frown in wonder at the feeling of the kiss as it continued.
- Desperation, sorrow and regret.
- Much older.
- Amy grinned.
- she wondered.
- the Doctor called, but he sulked over his hat.
- River asked the Doctor as the two of them and Olivia sat in a booth at an old time
  diner, both holding books.
- Jim the Fish!
- Olivia questioned him, impatiently.
- Now it's time for me to stop.
- It's horrid!
- he grinned, pointing to the moon showing itself early in the daylight sky over the
  lake.
- Of course, you lot did a lot more than look, didn't you?
- Big, silvery thing in the sky, you couldn't resist it.
- Clear?
- He looked to Olivia as she frowned in wide-eyed question and terror as the astronaut
  trudged out of the water.
- All she got was a flatline, making her look up at Olivia as tears welled in her
  eyes before she looked back at the Doctor in disbelief and despair.
- Olivia breathed, making River look to her as she lifted her head, glaring at the
  blonde through her tears.
- she ground out, shoving River's shoulder and making her stumble.
- River shot back.
- Amy shouted, and Olivia finally shoved Rory away but didn't charge at River as she
  wanted, choosing to glare at the other woman instead.
- She felt as helpless as she had when he'd been locked up in the Pandorica, but the
  difference now was there was no way he was coming back.
- There was no box to unlock.
- No way to get him back.
- River asked him.
- I'm Canton Everett Delaware III.
- I'm the King of Ok.
- Oh, that's a rubbish title.
- That's a good title!
- Oh, you bad, bad girl.
- he hoped.
- River questioned him, interrupting Amy.
- he asked her and she met his gaze, making him frown at the look in her eyes.
- There was apprehension, a conflict within her as she looked about ready to reply
  but remained silent.
- the Doctor grinned, running around the TARDIS console as Amy leaned on the railing
  facing away from it, River on another side watching the Doctor, Rory on another
  side and Olivia keeping her focus on operating the TARDIS.
- Now, 1482…full of glitches.
- Now then, Canton Everett Delaware III.
- She was in deep thought, wondering why the Doctor had interacted with his past and
  why he'd brought them all here in the first place.
- Why would he put them all through that?
- Watching him die.
- the Doctor whispered, making her jump and whirl around to look at him with wide
  eyes.
- I'm sorry.
- Olivia chirped as he stood and he looked to her in wonder as he went back to operating
  the TARDIS.
- The Doctor ran around the console as River came up next to Olivia to lean back on
  it next to her.
- the Doctor replied, sauntering around the console as he spoke.
- Off you pop, and make babies.
- And you, Doctor Song, back to prison.
- And me and Liv?
- We're late for a biplane lesson in 1911.
- Or it could be knitting.
- he questioned, irritably.
- He looked around at each of them, Amy, Rory and Olivia to his left, River to his
  right.
- I can see it in your faces.
- Don't play games with me.
- Who did you kill?
- Now, I love a bad girl, me, but trust you?
- he questioned.
- the Doctor called as he ran around the console.
- You lot, wait a moment.
- We're in the middle of the most powerful city in the most powerful country on Earth.
- they heard the Doctor from outside.
- the Doctor shouted.
- Olivia!
- Somebody!
- Never mind, though, because the answer is 'yes.'
- I'll take the case.
- Fellas, the guns, really?
- I just walked into the highest security office in the United States, parked a big,
  blue box on the rug.
- Rory called.
- ! 'Codename: The Doctor.'
- ! 'These are my top operatives: The Legs, The Nose and Mrs.'
- That's interesting.
- Give me five minutes.
- Canton asked of the TARDIS.
- And that's the man he walked past.
- One of them is worth listening to.
- NASA's where the spacemen live.
- he questioned, moving out of the way.
- And here.
- But then I forgot.
- Amy warned her.
- she laughed, making Olivia and Amy glance at each other in disbelief at her before
  looking back at them.
- Is that a mask?
- Is that a Star Trek thing?
- Look at that.
- Is that a Star Trek mask?
- Ben, that's gotta be you.
- Hang on.
- she wondered.
- Olivia pulled her Sonic from her front pants pocket as the thing in front of them
  made a terrifying, inhaling sound, a hole of a mouth appearing.
- Amy wondered, pulling out her phone and aiming it at the alien.
- Something in the back of her mind was yelling at her that there was something important
  she had to tell the Doctor, and she wondered if that's what Amy had meant when she
  said she 'had to tell the Doctor.'
- the Doctor cut in, placing his finger on a spot in the map as Olivia rushed up next
  to him to look at it.
- See?
- he answered.
- the little girl on the phone panicked.
- It's gonna get me!
- Mr.
- President, tell her help is on the way.
- and 'Who are you?'
- She was answering 'where.'
- Olivia questioned.
- Olivia wondered at the thing under a shaft of light.
- It was a slanted slab with wires hanging all around it.
- Amy asked.
- the Doctor grinned from under the gold screen before shoving it up to grin at the
  three girls.
- River questioned, following a network of thick cords toward a manhole with her flashlight.
- she smiled, knowingly at him and Olivia.
- Olivia sighed, looking to Amy who frowned back at her.
- he echoed, wondering if he'd heard right.
- But there's something…nagging at the back of my mind.
- Nothing down there I can see.
- Give me five minutes.
- I haven't seen him in a while.
- she called.
- the Doctor called, rushing toward him as the agent lay on the ground.
- the little girl called, but they couldn't see her as they looked around and Amy
  knelt down in front of the Doctor.
- She knew it better than Canton and his agents.
- The pen on the cord around her neck bounced off her stomach as she ran until she
  reached the end of the alley and glanced around the moonlit streets.
- A hooker strolled by, giving her a look before passing her completely and she glanced
  up and down the street to be sure it was clear of everyone else.
- Canton called from down the alley, making her gasp and turn to him, instantly forgetting
  the alien she'd just seen, before she turned to launch down the street.
- She came to a dead stop when she saw more agents marching toward her down the street
  and turned to head the other way…only to be stopped when she spotted more agents
  coming toward her.
- she snapped, raising a brow at him.
- she hissed.
- Olivia choked, as Canton unhooked her cuffs and the body bags were set down on either
  side of them.
- In the perfect cell.
- Nothing can penetrate these walls…no sound, not a radio wave.
- Not the tiniest particle of anything.
- In here, you're literally cut off from the rest of the universe.
- Canton wondered, hurrying after them and the Doctor ran in last.
- he called.
- Olivia grinned, leaning over to press a kiss to the console as the Doctor sailed
  up next to her and she turned to grab him by the face.
- Olivia shouted when the Doctor injected her hand and she pulled it back from his
  grip, successfully diffusing the situation.
- We're leading a revolution.
- It'll pick up your voice no matter what…telepathic connection.
- He pressed the button again, and everyone heard his voice repeat what he'd just
  said.
- The light will flash if you've left yourself a message.
- You keep checking your hand.
- Canton questioned, lowering his hand.
- the Doctor reminded him.
- Canton asked.
- the Doctor argued.
- That's helping.
- He lifted a wire in his hand, making Olivia roll her eyes and slap a hand to her
  face in exasperation.
- Gardner.
- Is that correct?
- Nixon wondered.
- Nixon laughed, lightly punching Grant's shoulder.
- Sigma, are doing some work for me personally.
- But I need you to release them now so they can get on with some very important work
  for the American people.
- Seeing that made his hearts clench so tight he could hardly breathe.
- I want to…you have no idea.
- she nearly screamed, shoving him away as he stared at her in disbelief, noticing
  River and Rory look down through the glass at them.
- Now, no more questions.
- Gun down!
- the Doctor called, running toward Canton as he stood in front of a door at the end
  of the hallway.
- they heard Amy call through the door, followed by her sobs as they all ran into
  the room.
- I don't know where I am.
- Rory spoke to the tiny thing in his hand.
- Wherever she is.
- And she always knows that I am coming for her.
- Do you understand me?
- Can you hear me?
- Doctor?
- Oh, God.
- a man called, making everyone look to the doorway as Rory kissed the recorder.
- I think someone has been shot.
- I think we should help.
- the Doctor wondered.
- Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face.
- That's a first for me.
- Olivia shot back.
- They don't have to.
- We know they influence human behavior any way they want.
- How's it doing that?
- the Doctor called, heading toward them again with a grin.
- she questioned.
- I've seen one of these before.
- Abandoned.
- I wonder how that happened.
- the Doctor grinned at the Silence.
- Were you in the middle of something?
- Wanna watch some television?
- Ah!
- Now stay where you are.
- ! '''Cause look at me, I''m confident.'
- Nice hair, clever, has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting
  people.
- I shouldn't like that.
- the Doctor replied as Rory ran to Amy to start unstrapping her.
- Or maybe you can just listen a minute.
- Because all I really want to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let
  you go in peace, yes.
- he admitted, turning the TV on then stepping back toward the Silent.
- I'm not really gonna let you go that easily.
- Nice thought, but it's not Christmas.
- First, you tell me about the girl.
- Who is she?
- Why is she important?
- the Doctor smiled to the Silent.
- You'll be so proud!
- ! '''Cause you helped!'
- Do you know how many people are watching this live on TV?
- Olivia continued.
- Olivia cheered.
- the Doctor wondered, facing off with the lead Silent.
- They won't even know they're doing it.
- he laughed, stopping them outside the TARDIS door.
- River called to Rory just as he got Amy out of the chair.
- she ordered as she leaned out the door, but ducked just as something hit the frame
  of the TARDIS door.
- River!
- You've got a screwdriver!
- she smirked, sensing Olivia watching her.
- Olivia lifted a brow at her with a smirk as River strolled through the door.
- the Doctor called as she shut the door behind her, she and River running toward
  the console to fly.
- the Doctor echoed with a frown.
- There's about a billion other things out there, just waiting to burn your whole
  world.
- But if you want to pretend you're safe just so you can sleep at night…ok, you're
  safe.
- the Doctor smiled, turning to Olivia and holding his hand out to her.
- She winked and turned to head into the TARDIS, Rory, River and Amy heading in ahead
  of her as she threw one last thing over her shoulder at him.
- You've never done that before.
- That was way too generous of you.
- He met her gaze as she stepped toward him, stopping an inch away from him.
- Olivia watched him follow her out, leaving the door ajar and she was tempted to
  follow them, but she knew had it been her, she would've wanted a private goodbye
  with him.
- She headed toward the console and leaned in front of the computer hanging over it,
  frowning in wonder when it turned itself on.
- she asked the TARDIS.
- River smirked, making the Doctor turn back and step toward her again.
- River asked of the Doctor's wide-eyed stare at her.
- It was…It was good.
- I mean…I thought I was.
- All that time…If I was pregnant for some of it, wouldn't it have had an effect?
- Rory called, stepping out of his hiding spot, holding her nanorecorder as the three
  looked to him.
- I'm a nurse.
- Anyone in the mood for adventures?
- Because I am.
- Olivia grinned, shooting her hand into the air as the Doctor worked on the console
  to operate the scanner.
- Olivia whispered so low that Amy and Rory couldn't hear and the Doctor only nodded
  to the screen.
- That's how she's stronger.
- She can do it, even though it hurts her every time.
- I know it does.
- You just handle it differently, that's all.
- I love you just the way you are.
- I wouldn't have you stronger, weaker, or cleverer or less.
- Who's that little girl?
- Who are the Silence?
- Why does the Silence need that little girl?
- Why is River serving time in a Storm Cage?
- Who did she kill?
- he squeaked, nearly dropping his Sonic Screwdriver, but he successfully caught it
  before it fell to the floor below.
- His green eyes shot wide at her as she stared wide eyes at him for his reaction.
- I just know…I'd be thrilled, Liv.
- If we were having a baby, I'd be so happy.
- I'd love it to death.
- We can talk about it later, Liv.
- Yes!
- Olivia asked the Doctor as they ran around the console, Amy and Rory watching them.
- the Doctor wondered, as they sailed past each other, completely in sync with each
  other as they flew the TARDIS.
- Joyce greeted from her phone.
- Can't wait to see you!
- Tomorrow, Earth time.
- Just don't tell her anything about the lakeside, ok?
- You guys visit.
- Aaron grinned, his green eyes alight under fiery red hair as he held his arms out
  to present himself.
- she called.
- Aaron grinned, hurrying after her as she headed for her room and he caught up with
  her as they reached her door.
- he called as she began gathering a few clothes from her closet and dresser.
- I saw him die…and I can't tell him.
- And where was I while he was being killed?
- Why wasn't the future me there?
- River said I had a future with him.
- Aaron placed his hands on her shoulders to turn her to face him, meeting her teary
  gaze.
- You need to stop thinking.
- Whatever happens, happens, and you'll find out where you were that day.
- You keep thinking you're gonna drive yourself crazy like you did while you were
  working at Torchwood, wondering where he was.
- Now come on.
- Coming!
- he grinned, moving aside to let her step inside and shutting the door behind her.
- Time is nothing to you!
- Out the door!
- the Doctor explained.
- he grinned, making Olivia slap a hand to her face in exasperation.
- Same as you!
- Avery snapped.
- Eight days, we've been stranded here, becalmed.
- Check.
- Grab yourself a parrot.
- We don't need four more empty bellies to fill.
- Take the doxies below to the galley.
- Set them to work.
- Listen, right?
- Olivia wondered, pulling one out as well.
- he asked.
- Big for five of you.
- The Doctor climbed down from the plank to help them, but Avery shoved him against
  the rigging as his men fought the girls, one man holding onto Rory so he wouldn't
  help them either.
- Amy shot back.
- Olivia shouted as one of the men marched toward her and Amy attempted to swing back
  toward Olivia but the sailor caught her legs and she lost her sword.
- the Doctor grinned, making everyone frown at him as he stepped toward Rory to examine
  his hand.
- We've managed to bagsy a ship where there's a demon popping in.
- Very efficient.
- Olivia growled at the pirate holding her but when he released her she stumbled at
  the sudden slack and into the mast nearby, a prick on her hand startling her.
- Rory told Amy, making her frown at him in confusion as he stumbled toward her.
- It's great.
- You should dress like a pirate more often.
- Look!
- Brilliant pirates, brilliant beards and you are brilliant!
- I should've let you keep your beard.
- A moment later they watched a woman in a flowing dress rise up from the light, glowing
  mystically as she floated onto the deck and glided toward the group.
- Amy grabbed onto Rory as he stared in awe at her and the Doctor held onto Olivia
  as she tried to step toward her but the pirate Amy had cut stepped passed all of
  them.
- the Doctor called, holding onto Olivia who struggled to pull herself from his grasp
  to touch the Siren, but he dragged her with him to check on Amy.
- Many a merchant ship laden with treasure has fallen prey to her.
- Olivia whined.
- Avery demanded, holding his gun toward the Doctor.
- Freud would say you're compensating.
- Ever met Freud?
- She can materialize through a single drop.
- Rory breathed.
- You fool, boy!
- Avery questioned Toby.
- Toby looked away in sorrow and Avery read the look in his eyes, realizing what had
  happened.
- She told me all about you.
- How you were a captain in the Navy.
- He paused to cough again as Avery looked ashamed.
- It's too late.
- There's a monster aboard.
- Toby asked before revealing the spot on his hand and the Doctor stepped toward him
  as he coughed again.
- Damaged too easily.
- It's only a matter of time before everyone gets…bruised.
- My ship, it can sail us all away from here.
- Avery, you and me, we fetch it.
- Avery snapped at Toby.
- Olivia snapped, marching past him as he stared at her in surprise and she placed
  her hands on Toby's shoulders.
- Curse means we're helpless.
- We are not helpless!
- A Naval Officer.
- the first mate echoed, mockingly as Olivia pulled Toby back to wrap an arm around
  his shoulders.
- Toby snarled, trying to advance on him, but the three held him back.
- the first mate mocked.
- Rory snapped, irritably.
- Toby led the three to a nook in the barrels where he sat himself in the corner as
  the adults sat around him.
- Olivia noticed the image on it was a mermaid and found it ironic that Avery would
  be using it as a good luck charm when that's what was hunting them.
- He grabbed the medallion from him and breathed on it, making the couple frown at
  each other as Olivia stared at him in wonder.
- she questioned.
- She got sulky then had a tantrum!
- he grinned as Olivia tried to stand but stumbled into the barrel again when the
  boat rocked again.
- Avery shouted from the rigging, making her look to him with wide eyes.
- Avery called over the rain.
- Avery shouted at him.
- Everyone stopped when they heard it and stared at the crown rolling across the deck…a
  reflective surface everyone thought was gone.
- Avery shouted at Toby as Olivia and Rory tried to reach for her, Toby reaching for
  her as well.
- the Doctor shouted, clambering toward Olivia as she reached for the Siren.
- he shouted, trying to get to the crown, but when he grabbed it to toss it overboard,
  he heard her scream and looked up to see she'd gone in a cloud of smoke.
- she wondered, seeing the Doctor grabbing Amy by the arms, speaking to her, though
  she couldn't hear what he was saying or the rain pouring outside.
- Doctor!
- I'm alright!
- I'm in here!
- She could see him talking to the others before it looked like they all pricked their
  hands, and the Siren returned, singing her song and making them all reach out to
  her.
- she grinned, rushing toward him and kneeling next to him as he awoke.
- It went straight through the glass as if it were a bubble and they saw the piece
  of metal bounce off the deck.
- he replied.
- Avery reported as he stopped next to one of the tables.
- the Doctor called, grabbing Olivia's hand and dragging her toward the blue box.
- Olivia called, pulling out her Sonic and aiming it at Toby to scan him then looked
  to the results.
- the Doctor realized when the Siren was nearly upon them, pulling out a handkerchief
  and smothering Olivia's nose with it.
- he explained, making Amy freeze and step back from Rory to look to them with wide
  eyes, and the Siren fazed back to green.
- It's teleporting everyone onboard.
- The crew are dead, and so the sick bay has nothing to do.
- It's been looking after humanity whilst it's been idle.
- Look at her.
- Ooh!
- Amy told the Siren, choking up.
- Put your hand in the light.
- Rory's sick.
- Amy asked.
- Amy asked Rory, nodding at the Doctor who started backing away slowly, taking Olivia's
  hand to pull her with him.
- Avery asked.
- Amy and the Doctor lifted him from the table as Olivia ran to the TARDIS and opened
  the door, letting the three pass and Amy laid Rory down on the floor near the door
  as Olivia shut it behind them.
- He believes in you!
- my fave episode!
- yay!
- It's the warning lights!
- I'm getting rid of those!
- In an emergency we wrap up our thoughts in Psychic containers and send them through
  time and space.
- He tossed the box up and Amy quickly caught it to stare at the image on one side.
- The mark of the Corsair.
- Fantastic bloke!
- He had that snake as a tattoo in every regeneration.
- He didn't feel like himself unless he had the tattoo.
- Or herself a couple of times.
- Ooh!
- Olivia shot back as he ran around the console.
- the Doctor replied, flying the ship.
- Goodbye, swimming pool!
- Goodbye, scullery!
- Rory frowned.
- He tossed the rock up and watched it fall.
- Air's breathable.
- Rory wondered, examining a light.
- the Doctor explained, climbing out of the tub.
- Thief!
- Goodbye!
- No, not goodbye.
- Olivia snapped, trying to wedge her arms between them, the Doctor trying to push
  the strange woman away as the man that had come after her tried to pull her away
  as well.
- the Doctor questioned the woman.
- You have stolen me.
- You are stealing me.
- Just keep back from this one.
- You will be angry.
- the Doctor asked, stepping out from behind Amy and Rory but remaining behind Olivia
  to stare at Idris over her shoulder.
- Uncle wondered.
- Oods are good.
- Love an Ood.
- Hello, Ood!
- Can't you talk?
- Oh, I see, it's damaged.
- House repaired him.
- Olivia shouted in pain, placing a hand on her head as it instantly began to throb
  as the Doctor only listened to the voices, one calling for the High Council of Time
  Lords.
- Rory asked the Doctor as Amy held Olivia's shoulders, Olivia panting in pain as
  she recovered.
- But that's…it's not possible.
- Liv!
- he questioned them.
- And the House.
- Nephew!
- This is the House.
- This world.
- Amy asked them.
- Hard outer surface…that's the planet we're walking on.
- Like Auntie and Uncle and Nephew.
- Last Time Lord.
- Your people were so kind.
- Be here in safety, Doctor.
- Go!
- Auntie grinned, stepping toward Amy and reaching for her face.
- I heard them.
- We heard them.
- Me and Liv.
- He pressed the button to hang up the phone before hitting the button on the Sonic,
  making Olivia frown at him.
- The Doctor placed his hand on them before opening the doors to reveal shelves full
  of boxes like the one they'd found.
- I really thought I had some friends here.
- He turned away from the boxes to glare at the couple as Olivia only remained by
  his side.
- Yes, I know!
- the Doctor snapped, marching toward them as he pulled the Sonic from his jacket
  and scanned Uncle.
- The Doctor pulled Uncle's hat off which had covered his right, alien ear.
- And how's your dancing?!
- Yeah.
- Also, the doors seem to have locked behind us.
- she may surprise everyone with the way she handles the rest of this.
- the Doctor demanded, marching into the room where Idris was being held in a cage,
  dragging Olivia behind him.
- They put me in here.
- What do you call me?
- We travel.
- Yes, that's it.
- Names are funny.
- the Doctor argued.
- I was already a museum piece when you were young.
- Oh!
- It's so big!
- So complicated.
- Olivia wondered, looking to Idris.
- he chirped with a frown, watching them.
- House feeds on rift energy and TARDISes are bursting with it.
- And not raw, lovely and cooked.
- Processed food.
- That would blow a hole in the universe.
- Rory!
- Amy shot back.
- he shouted.
- she called but the line was dead and when she looked to the Doctor, she shook her
  head as tears welled in her eyes.
- Hijacked.
- Go?
- What do you mean, go?!
- Auntie said.
- Look at her!
- she wondered as the Doctor scanned her with the Sonic then looked to the results.
- I could blow the casing in no time.
- No.
- Stop it.
- Don't get emotional.
- Hmm, that's what the orangey girl says.
- You're the Doctor.
- he shouted back, snatching his Sonic from her when she presented it to him.
- I've got Liv dying over there, you dying over here, two dead already, and I'm a
  madman with a box, without a box!
- I'm stuck down the plughole at the end of the universe in a stupid, old junkyard!
- Don't you see?
- she asked, meeting Idris' gaze and she only offered a smile.
- the Doctor called, drawing her attention to him.
- he shot back as Olivia stepped next to him to help him.
- You've been walking past it for seven hundred years.
- Even Olivia saw it.
- Seven hundred years.
- Olivia grinned to the Doctor.
- he ordered her, tossing the ropes he was using to drag the panel with aside to march
  toward Idris.
- Olivia called in offense, before gasping and hurrying toward Idris when she collapsed
  against the Doctor as he steadied her.
- Time to do a quick check!
- the Doctor chirped as Idris stepped toward the console and he grabbed thick, long
  red cords from the pile nearby before running back toward it, handing one to Olivia.
- Olivia looked to Idris as she looked at herself in the mirror set up on the console.
- Ok.
- Diverting all power to thrust.
- It can't even start.
- There's no…power!
- it's not the secret you're probably thinking it is.
- the Doctor asked her.
- Idris asked.
- the Doctor warned.
- Olivia called back.
- Olivia explained.
- I'll send you the passkey when you get there.
- Olivia wondered.
- the Doctor argued.
- the Doctor called to Idris as they all worked.
- Idris observed as he helped her on a panel.
- he shouted, rushing toward the edge and gripping a nook in the wall to steady himself
  when he saw her hands gripping the edge of the floor.
- He reached out and gripped one of her hands as her feet kicked just above the barrier
  of energy.
- Hold my hand!
- Pull yourself up!
- Idris reported.
- A control room she knew well.
- Except she's a woman.
- the Doctor retorted as Idris stood.
- Liv!
- the Doctor replied, pacing around the console.
- Just listen to them.
- You don't have the thrust, and you know it.
- Right now I'm your only hope for getting out of your little bubble through the rift
  and into my universe.
- And mine's the one with the food in it!
- You just have to promise not to kill us.
- That's all.
- Easy.
- You'll free up thrust, enough to make it through.
- I can delete rooms.
- And I can also rid myself of vermin if I delete this room first.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye, little humans.
- Why should it matter to me in which room you die?
- I can kill you just as easily here as anywhere.
- Fear me.
- Oh, can kill us in oodles of really inventive ways.
- the Doctor snapped.
- You forced the TARDIS into a body so she'd burn out safely a very long way away
  from this control room.
- A flesh body can't hold the TARDIS matrix and live!
- Bigger on the inside!
- See, House, that's your problem.
- The size of a planet, but inside you are just…so…small!
- A big, complicated word, but so sad.
- I'll always be here, but this is when we talked, and now, even that has come to
  an end.
- I just wanted to say…Hello.
- Hello, Doctor.
- he called back.
- She kept repeating something.
- I shouldn't let it get to me, but it still does.
- Being alive.
- Best thing there is.
- Being alive, right now.
- That's all that counts.
- Nearly finished.
- Two more minutes, then we're off.
- Long after the rest of us have gone.
- The House deleted all the bedrooms.
- I should probably make you two a new bedroom.
- Bunk beds are cool!
- A bed…with a ladder.
- Up those stairs.
- Keep walking till you find it.
- he grinned at her as she watched him.
- Can you hear me?
- he grinned, taking a turn around the console.
- Olivia giggled, as she made her way to the bathroom while he adjusted in the bed.
- That junkyard was almost as bad as being in that Star Whale then being puked up.
- Wait!
- he called, hurrying off the bed to climb back down and hurry toward her as she turned
  to lean on the frame of the bathroom door.
- he asked, knowing she would understand his meaning.
- Her hands froze in her hair, making the Doctor sit up as they kept each other's
  gazes.
- She went to hang her fluffy robe in her closet as he stood and stepped toward her,
  making her freeze when she heard his footsteps.
- he asked, making Rory turn and raise his hand as Olivia's hand shot in the air as
  well with a grin.
- Take your time, don't rush.
- she announced.
- the Doctor called back as they thrashed around.
- A Cockerel.
- Love a Cockerel.
- Amy shot back.
- the Doctor wondered before grabbing Olivia's hand and pulling her toward the stairs
  leading into the monastery.
- Rory wondered as they continued.
- the Doctor asked as they stepped up another small set of stairs.
- That's old stuff.
- he told her but she only dragged him after the Doctor and Olivia.
- she, Cleaves, sneered, taking the paper from him to read it.
- They stopped to let Cleaves and Dicken change out of their Acid Suits and lead them
  the rest of the way and into a room with a huge metal vat of white liquid.
- It's fully programmable matter.
- Down to the hairs on its chinny chin chin.
- Even clothes.
- And everything's identical.
- Don't be scared.
- This thing?
- So now we mine the acid using these doppelgangers, or Gangers.
- Olivia frowned, seeing him struggle as he still scanned the Flesh with his Sonic.
- No idea.
- I mean, I felt it in my mind.
- the Doctor demanded.
- So alive.
- She swallowed and sneered in disgust as it filled with Flesh and the Doctor leaned
  next to her to watch as Jennifer was slowly formed, clothes and all.
- Olivia snapped, glancing between them all.
- Jimmy wondered.
- The factory's seen better days.
- You are making a massive mistake here.
- You're right at the crossroads of it.
- Don't turn the wrong way.
- he ground out, softly so that only Olivia could hear him.
- Olivia called as they ran toward the computers.
- the Doctor began, still working.
- When that wave hits…kaboom.
- Olivia grabbed the lapel of his jacket and planted her lips to his before quickly
  pulling away with a smack.
- Olivia swallowed, twirling her Psychic Wedding Band around her finger nervously
  as she watched him climb the ladder toward the box that read 'High Voltage.'
- He opened it and she winced when he grabbed onto something and pulled it away, making
  the box spark as the weather vane still twirled like mad on its stand.
- she screamed, kneeling next to him and trying to wake him.
- Wake up!
- Did you do it?!
- i felt like she was kind fading into the background of the Doctor's cleverness.
- Good.
- he called when he spotted her at the bottom of the stairs.
- Ganger got an electric shock, toddled off, killed his operator right there in his
  harness.
- I've seen the photos.
- he asked her.
- I've got your back.
- Rory called, turning to see what was going on.
- Rory shouted, pulling at the arm holding Olivia against the wall as she kicked to
  be free, still struggling for air as she felt her lungs burning for oxygen.
- she coughed as she glared at Jennifer's face slithering back into the stall.
- Olivia opened her eyes just enough to see Jennifer look around before she stepped
  closer to Olivia, leaning forward to stare at her but she remained still, keeping
  her breathing even, though her heart was racing a mile a minute.
- Jennifer finally moved away and headed out the door, making Olivia sigh in relief
  and lift her head to lean in back on the mirror.
- She groaned as she pushed herself off sink then felt at her head to make sure it
  wasn't bleeding.
- the Doctor called, rushing toward her to look her over, noticing her hand on her
  head.
- Amy wondered.
- Jimmy called, as they still ran.
- she questioned.
- I want us to keep together, ok?
- Olivia asked him as he dragged her along.
- she demanded.
- This is where we coming after we dropped off Amy and Rory, so what is this?
- We have to find Rory and Jennifer and once this is all sorted, you'll understand.
- He led them back to the Flesh room, making her give a frown when he stepped up to
  the vat to examine it again, using his Sonic on it.
- she called, looking down at his shoes and he yelped before leaning down to unlace
  them as the acid from the ground started eating away at them.
- Acid everywhere and you just walk around like nothing can touch you.
- she squeaked as he pulled her along and she kept up next to him.
- She's just scared.
- The second is to knuckle down and work together, try to work out how best we can
  help you.
- he cheered.
- But do try.
- he finished for her, stepping through the plastic draped over the doorway, the Gangers
  following behind him.
- Size ten.
- He looked to her with a sneer of displeasure, making her glare back at him.
- The storm has hardwired them.
- the Doctor went on as Olivia stood next to him.
- Once I can reach her, I can get you all off this island, humans and Gangers.
- Ganger Jimmy asked.
- I drank about eight pints of tea, and they told me I had a wee boy, and I just burst
  out laughing.
- No idea why.
- Good.
- Right.
- Ganger Cleaves asked.
- the Doctor shouted, he and Amy running toward Buzzer as Olivia moved to take the
  thing from Cleaves, but she aimed it at her.
- Cleaves growled as Olivia shoved away, holding the circuit probe as she stood.
- How can you?
- It's us and them now.
- the Doctor chirped defensively.
- No, never mind.
- Olivia snapped.
- Olivia breathed before gasping and jumping back when Ganger Doctor screamed in agony
  and clamped his hands over his face.
- he asked in a different voice, making Olivia hurry toward the Doctor to stand next
  to him, gripping his arm.
- Why?
- No!
- Let it go!
- the Doctor called, grabbing onto his Ganger's lapels to keep him still.
- Hold on!
- Ganger Doctor growled, his hands over his face again.
- Olivia called, cautiously as she slowly approached him.
- The Gangers on the other side of the door started banging on it, making everyone
  else place more barricades in front of it as the Doctor and Amy only watched Olivia
  and Ganger Doctor.
- Olivia Lydia Felton.
- My girl.
- The girl who never let me go.
- Jimmy wondered.
- See?
- Olivia squeaked, looking to the one that held her hand.
- Cleaves snapped.
- Olivia snapped back, looking at the Doctors' shoes again.
- the Doctor guessed, heading toward the wall to move a covering from the vent he
  found there.
- An escape route!
- We're under stress.
- she smirked.
- Both Doctors turned to her with a frown each.
- Amy wondered.
- the Doctor objected as they stopped.
- Takes a long time to find someone in a maze.
- Ganger Doctor replied.
- It's good.
- My son's five.
- Amy retorted at Olivia who only nodded with a huge grin.
- Amy called.
- the Doctor added, raising his hand as he stood tall.
- Amy wondered.
- he groaned.
- the Doctor cheered.
- Amy told Cleaves as she ran up to the panel, Ganger Doctor right behind her as Olivia
  remained behind the panel with the Doctor, watching them.
- They stared at the screen as Cleaves worked on it.
- John's calling emergency Alpha.
- St.
- John's calling the mainland.
- Are you receiving me, Captain?
- John's calling the mainland.
- Come in.
- The storm's affected our Gangers.
- John's.
- Shuttles dispatched.
- And, Captain, any further transmission sent by me must come with the following codeword.
- Buzzer replied.
- He grabbed Amy's chair and spun her around in it before turning back to the panel.
- the Doctor called with a frown.
- she smiled, making him nod and she held up her left hand to show off her Psychic
  Wedding Band.
- One of you has one, the other doesn't.
- You keep away.
- It wants revenge.
- It's in pain, angry.
- You can't ever be.
- I thought I'd explained this.
- Why not?
- She stepped around the panel to be there when Olivia turned to head the other way.
- Gamma static could fry out NAV controls.
- Sit tight.
- We'll get to you.
- Jimmy called when he was cut off by feedback.
- We've been through too much.
- Amy frowned.
- Olivia caught the Sonic, giving him a wink before handing it to Ganger Doctor.
- It's fine.
- It'll be alright.
- the Doctor replied before they stopped and he scanned the Sonic around.
- Olivia called, pulling him to his left toward a body and she knelt in front of her.
- She's been out here for hours.
- she ground out defiantly.
- She felt at his head to make sure he wasn't bleeding then leaned her ear next to
  his mouth to make sure he was breathing.
- She looked up with wide eyes to see the Gangers of Cleaves, Jimmy and Dicken in
  acid suits, making her swallow nervously.
- she snarled, charging at him and she was about to pound on his chest but he grabbed
  her wrists and shoved her down so that her back hit the table they stood next to,
  allowing him to loom over her as she met his gaze with her wide-eyed stare.
- Rory shouted, making her look to the doorway to see Jennifer shoving Rory into the
  room with Ganger Cleaves following right behind them and he frowned up at Olivia.
- Olivia questioned, turning to face him as he shuddered.
- I'm sorry, Olivia.
- Ganger Doctor shot back.
- The humans won't stand a chance.
- Jimmy!
- Get the phone.
- No.
- Fine.
- I'll get the phone.
- Ganger Doctor called.
- Adam!
- I'm the Doctor.
- Well, other Doctor.
- Or Smith.
- It's complicated and boring.
- Anyway, who cares?
- Ganger Doctor cheered back, and Olivia couldn't help but give a small giggle.
- Adam replied, excitedly as Ganger Doctor turned to Ganger Jimmy, who stared back
  in terror.
- Ganger Cleaves snapped.
- Look at you, Jen.
- You were a sweet kid.
- Look at you now…the stuff of nightmares.
- Olivia questioned her.
- the Doctor called from the door with Ganger Cleaves and Dicken before Jennifer slammed
  against the door, trying to get in.
- Amy ground out.
- Amy insisted as the Doctor, Rory and Olivia hurried toward the door to see what
  the hold-up was.
- And you are amazing, and yeah, I misjudged you.
- But you're not…him.
- The Flesh took his off, the Doctor didn't.
- That's the only detail I would've spotted, but no one else.
- This is my factory.
- Ganger Doctor retorted before pressing a kiss to her head.
- Cleaves wondered, then pointed to her head.
- the Doctor replied, leaning down under his console to search for something.
- He stood when he found a vile of red liquid and tossed it to Cleaves.
- Dicken wondered.
- Cleaves asked Dicken as they stepped toward the door.
- the Doctor replied, making them both frown at him.
- he called when they stepped inside, Olivia shutting the door behind them as the
  Doctor stopped at the console.
- Amy breathed as Rory held her waist, trying to comfort her.
- Rory…I don't like this.
- he retorted as Olivia ran up the stairs toward him.
- I needed to see the Flesh in its early days.
- That's why I scanned it.
- That's why we were there in the first place.
- I was gonna drop you off for fish and chips, first, but things happened and there
  was stuff and shenanigans.
- Amy asked her with a frown before looking to the Doctor.
- Rory demanded as Olivia stepped around Amy to take Rory's arm.
- He yanked his arm from her to wrap both of them around Amy.
- We're coming for you, I swear.
- Rory shouted, running from Olivia's grasp to kneel beside the pile, shuddering with
  sobs.
- Seal Levels Twelve, Thirteen and Fourteen.
- You hear everything.
- So you tell me what I need to know.
- he replied, hitting a lever.
- the Doctor cheered, operating the console with Olivia.
- he wondered, glancing to Vastra and Jenny.
- Rory wondered.
- The Doctor took me ice skating on the River Thames in 1814, the last of the great
  Frost Fairs.
- I always know.
- I need to know what to expect.
- She reached through the bars and Olivia took her hand, both holding on tightly.
- he instantly questioned as she passed him and headed for the console and he shut
  the door, following her.
- She turned back to the console and slammed a lever down.
- He is not a goblin or a phantom or a trickster.
- Perhaps you should've wondered why we call them Headless.
- Guess who!
- one of the Clerics shouted below pointing his gun at a monk.
- Manton shouted.
- One of the monks shot a burst of energy at one of the men, sending him to the ground.
- Nobody discharge their weapon in this room.
- Nobody!
- Do not fire.
- Stop…wait.
- Listen to me.
- Manton pulled the pack from his weapon and raised them both separately in the air.
- He set his pack down at his feet.
- The Doctor is trying to make fools of us.
- We are soldiers of God.
- I want you to be famous for those exact words.
- I want people to call you Colonel Run Away.
- He stood from his chair to step within an inch of Manton.
- She smiled and stepped closer to place a hand over his cheek, stroking it with her
  thumb.
- Olivia smiled, fondly.
- Maybe I should give it a go.
- He hugged her as she laughed.
- Both of you.
- Vastra called, coming into the room and gripping the railing at the top of the stairs
  as she stared at the window overlooking the base.
- They're leaving.
- Demons Run is ours, without a drop of blood spilled.
- she teased, giving him a playful nudge, but even Amy and Rory could feel the weight
  of her words as they glanced between them, but Olivia diverted them.
- He glanced at her every now and then as she clutched his arm tighter and tighter
  with each step they took.
- Strax snapped.
- I've still gotta work out what this base is for.
- Amy called, making them turn back to her.
- Rory guessed as they crowded around Melody again.
- Rory asked him, making the Doctor smile at him.
- Doctor, it's our baby.
- Tell us something.
- the Doctor shot back then chuckled.
- Completely human.
- he insisted, glancing between them.
- Olivia questioned.
- That's all humany, private stuff, it just sort of goes on.
- No!
- Impossible!
- It's all running about, sexy fish vampires, and blowing up stuff.
- And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning.
- Then he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic, then I had to reboot
  the whole universe.
- Long story.
- the Doctor continued, ignoring all of them.
- the Doctor whispered again, making Olivia hug him tighter as the other two headed
  out of the room before he tried to look down at her and she looked up at him with
  her wide, jade gaze.
- Oh, don't worry.
- I'm a long way away, but I like to keep tabs on you.
- The child, then.
- She can be.
- the Doctor shouted as he came to a door at the end of the hall leading into the
  cargo bay where everyone was, using his Sonic to open the door.
- I've had a good life.
- You'll be back on your feet in no time.
- Olivia said nothing and only hugged her, knowing nothing she might say could make
  her feel any better.
- Her name is Lorna.
- He used his Sonic scan her vital signs, kneeling next to her and looking to the
  results before rubbing his eyes.
- Hey, we ran, you and me.
- Vastra asked him.
- she demanded, making him stop and turn to her.
- he demanded, marching toward River as Olivia remained where she was, watching.
- the Doctor demanded of her, bringing her attention back to him.
- You make them so afraid.
- When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the universe, did you ever
  think you'd become this?
- The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name.
- ! '''Doctor.'''
- The word for 'healer' and 'wise man' throughout the universe.
- We get that word from you, you know.
- The symbols on it took some time to rearrange themselves in her mind before her
  eyes widened when she read a very familiar name on it.
- She looked to the Doctor just as he looked to River in wide-eyed disbelief, and
  River only smiled at him as he straightened.
- River, get them all home.
- She turned in his arms and wrapped hers around his neck to bury her face in his
  chest.
- All the time in the world, actually.
- Just us.
- she laughed, lightly hitting his arm before trying, half-heartedly to push away
  from him.
- he insisted before stepping toward the console to flip a switch and the room was
  filled with a familiar tune.
- It was two humans having a child that…began in flight in the Time Vortex.
- This would be a Time Lord and a human making a child.
- It has to be human in order for both of you to survive.
- We're too different.
- Your body would be in overdrive to help it grow, and if your body fails, we could
  lose it or there could be complications with the birth and you could be lost, or
  neither one of you would make it.
- In the meantime, we'll find Melody, sort her out, and have a few more adventures
  before then.
- she smirked, stopping their dance and throwing her arms around him to hug him close.
- Olivia, Amy and Rory crowded behind him, staring at the paper before hearing the
  loud rumble of an engine, and as the Doctor lowered the paper they stared at the
  red sports car barreling through the field toward them.
- Doctor very lost.
- Olivia snapped, shooting everyone's gazes to her.
- Mels asked, heading toward the TARDIS.
- That's just brilliant.
- Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
- What the hell?
- Olivia blurted.
- Olivia frowned up at him.
- the Doctor shouted, running toward the hole in the cylinder in the center of the
  console as Olivia pulled herself up to the console, trying to stabilize the ship.
- Mels shot back, Amy hanging onto the scanner, Rory hanging onto the railing around
  the console.
- the Doctor shot back, pumping a lever on the console.
- Olivia shot back as they all thrashed around the control room, the smoke filling
  it starting to choke them.
- the Doctor ordered as they stumbled out of the TARDIS.
- Don't breathe the smoke.
- the Doctor demanded, grabbing it from her and sneering at it before stepping toward
  the desk to the left of his TARDIS.
- the Doctor told the man whose face he'd yet to see.
- Amy questioned as they all stared at him.
- Amy asked the Doctor as she and Rory stepped in front of him and Olivia.
- You see?
- Time travel.
- Olivia shouted before she was shoved to the ground when Hitler shot at the man several
  times.
- Amy questioned him as he worked.
- the Doctor asked her, trying to keep her awake.
- Let's get married.
- You stay alive and I'll marry you, deal?
- Olivia called as they pulled them toward the desk and Mels stood, staring at her
  hands in awe.
- You see?
- It all worked out in the end, didn't it?
- she grinned, running to the mirror on her left to look at herself.
- It just doesn't stop, does it?
- Look at that!
- Everything changes!
- Oh, but I love it!
- Olivia questioned as Amy and Rory stared at her in shock and the Doctor covered
  his eyes before looking back at her.
- River questioned.
- Rory wondered after River hurried out of the room again and Olivia raised her hand
  in agreement.
- Amy argued then asked the Doctor.
- River smirked to Olivia who stared at her in wide eyed confusion.
- Olivia called, trying to rush toward him but River kept a grip on her arm.
- the Doctor questioned, gripping at his chest.
- knew that was gonna happen sooner or later!
- new chappie!
- She quickly got to her feet and tried to run back into the building to help the
  Doctor, but River grabbed her arm before she could pass her.
- Olivia instantly began struggling, but she was only dragged her toward the group
  of soldiers at the entrance.
- Thanks, boys!
- River replied.
- River climbed off and grabbed Olivia's arm to drag her off as well, pulling her
  toward the door and Olivia stared huge eyes at all the officers and their wives
  having a formal meal in a huge room.
- River suggested.
- Olivia questioned, stepping toward the mirror to stand next to it.
- Almost like…we were meant to be good friends, if not best mates.
- So, bare with me, alright?
- Where's Rory?
- Olivia frowned when Amy only stepped closer to River.
- That was not Amy.
- Olivia grinned, tears welling in her eyes.
- He gave a grunt and a soft groan of pain, making her frown and back away enough
  to look into his eyes, realizing he wasn't as well as he made out he was.
- Rule twenty-seven.
- With four hundred twenty-three life signs inside.
- A robot worked by tiny people.
- he asked, stepping right up to it and looking into the eyes, then looked to his
  cane again.
- Ooh!
- Watch what you eat.
- he shouted, moving himself toward the stairs to sit on the lowest one.
- Just had a quick left leg power nap.
- I forgot I had one scheduled.
- Actually, I'd better sit down.
- Robot Amy turned to River, opened her mouth wide again and the light from it attacked
  her.
- it asked.
- ! '''The Woman Who Killed the Doctor.'''
- It sounds like you've got my biography in there.
- Why's it called that?
- It is a religious order or movement.
- Call yourselves a records—?
- Olivia sobbed, trying to sit him up then looked up at River when the light around
  her turned fiery red and she cried out in pain.
- Amy asked.
- This is me actually talking.
- Olivia cried.
- Amy called as Olivia tried to help him to his feet.
- Doctor, help us!
- River exasperated as she stood.
- She's gotta be a woman.
- Am I right?
- the Doctor ordered, making her nod, but she looked to River as she watched them.
- River was confused, and Olivia could tell she was insistent on finding out what
  she wanted to know.
- She turned and dragged her toward the TARDIS, unlocked the door and let her in before
  hurrying back to the Doctor as he rolled onto his back, painfully.
- She knelt next to him, looking over him as she placed a hand over his cheek.
- I'll be back.
- River asked her as they both worked on the console, and the engines made their telltale
  sound.
- Amy called as she and Rory appeared near the door and looked around the control
  room.
- She taught me.
- She looked to Olivia still standing at the console.
- Ponds, listen to me.
- River asked before leaning closer to him so he could whisper in her ear.
- Olivia whispered as River turned to the Doctor.
- Amy asked her and Olivia only shook her head, watching River slowly approach the
  Doctor.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy wondered, but instead of answering her question the Doctor only grinned and
  hurried around the console.
- Amy wondered, making him stop at the top of the stairs to turn to her.
- he murmured and she nodded with a grin.
- he cried, lifting a hand to the spot she'd smacked.
- she snapped before punching his arm, making him wince.
- She stepped toward the console, frowning when she saw the Doctor staring at her
  but said nothing as she looked back to what she was doing.
- Why?
- She frowned as she looked to the Doctor, still holding a hand to her head.
- He kissed her forehead before hurrying around the console.
- Amy wondered as he worked on the console and Rory looked over Olivia.
- he asked, making her frown at him in wonder.
- Planets and history and stuff, that's what we do.
- But not today, no.
- she retorted, making him frown at her as they stopped at a door and she glanced
  at him as she knocked.
- I can't be expected to get down all them stairs!
- I'll be able to manage when I get the knees.
- Mrs.
- Rossiter objected, grabbing her door and getting ready to close it if she had to.
- Amy smiled.
- Call me 'Doctor' and call her 'Olivia.'
- He started getting these nervous ticks.
- You know, funny, little cough, blinking all the time.
- And now it's got completely out of hand.
- Not a fear of pants, though, if that's what you're thinking.
- It's a fear of everything.
- He thinks the old lady across the way is a witch.
- He hates having a bath in case there's something under the water.
- I'm not an expert.
- he called, opening the door and hurrying in and Olivia was about to run in after
  him, but the Doctor stopped her.
- He nodded and took her hand to step into the doorway.
- George gasped.
- Yeah?
- Me too.
- When I was your age – about, ooh, a thousand years ago – I loved a good bedtime
  story.
- The Three Little Sontarans, The Emperor Dalek's New Clothes, Snow White and the
  Seven Keys to Doomsday.
- He tossed the cube across the room.
- It must be broken.
- Olivia fake smiled and gave the Doctor a scolding look before standing and hurrying
  to Alex as he picked it up, and she took it then looked for a place to put it.
- Anything that frightens him, we put it in the cupboard.
- the Doctor asked George, but he only blinked in response, making the Doctor turned
  toward the cupboard to approach it.
- He touched the door, slowly lifting a hand toward the key, making Olivia swallow.
- She smiled at him and lifted a hand to run it over his head as the Doctor watched
  them then pulled out his Sonic Screwdriver.
- Olivia smiled as she looked to George who only stared at his toys coming to life
  and she handed her Sonic to him.
- That's what I've heard.
- Go on, give us a smile.
- the Doctor shouted, standing and approaching Alex, making him stop and turn to him
  with wide eyes.
- Cupboard not bare.
- Stay away from cupboard.
- And there's something else.
- Something I've missed, something staring me in the face.
- He stared at the Doctor as he only continued making tea before looking to Olivia
  who only shrugged before he marched toward the Doctor.
- Alex snapped as the Doctor went to the fridge to open it, but Alex marched toward
  him to shut the door, looking at the Doctor.
- Alex snapped again and the Doctor only stared at him before he sighed.
- I don't care who you are or what wheels have been set in motion.
- George sent a message, a distress call, if you like.
- You see these eyes?
- They're old eyes.
- the Doctor wondered, his cup of tea in one hand, the photo album in the other as
  Olivia and Alex sat on the sofa with their own cups of tea, Olivia nibbling on a
  Jammie Dodger.
- Good, nice tea.
- Nothing like a cuppa.
- the Doctor went on.
- Come on, Alex!
- Alex, come on!
- How powerful, how evil that thing might be.
- Come on, Alex!
- Alex, come on!
- Are you crazy?!
- The Doctor cracked his knuckles, then his neck before slowly stepping to the cupboard
  as George breathed heavily in panic.
- The Doctor pressed his ear to the door before reaching for the key, unlocking the
  door then quickly pulling it open and stepping back, making all of them gasp…but
  nothing happened.
- Look I don't like this.
- he cut himself off before glancing between them.
- As much IVF as we could afford, but…Claire can't have kids.
- Olivia murmured, but froze and looked to his bedside table when it began rattling,
  the noise from the lift sounding.
- the Doctor shouted, all three struggling to stay out of the light of the cupboard.
- the Doctor called, running around the room and pounding on doors.
- Don't do this!
- We wanna help you!
- We went into the cupboard!
- Cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, fruits, chickens.
- Wood.
- That's possible.
- Alex snapped before grabbing the Doctor's arm and turning him to face him.
- What is George?
- And how could I forget that Claire can't have kids.
- the Doctor retorted.
- More than a few.
- They've knocked down the blocks I've been 'round and rebuilt them with bigger blocks,
  superblocks!
- And I've been 'round them as well.
- Use your telepathy to speak to him.
- It's like one of George's habits.
- And George isn't just an ordinary little boy.
- We know that now.
- So anything scary, he puts in here.
- Scary toys, like the doll's house.
- Scary noises, like the lift.
- Even his little rituals have become part of it.
- the Doctor replied, tucking the Sonic away and grabbing Olivia's hand to drag her
  toward a door that they opened to reveal a huge pair of patterned, safety scissors.
- the childish voice of the doll called as the Doctor handed the scissors to Alex
  when he followed.
- the Doctor hit his forehead hard as they stopped in and open room with a staircase.
- George is a Tenza!
- A Tenza.
- He opened the door he found only to find more dolls and shut it again as the three
  went up the staircase.
- He sensed that instinctively and sought you out, but something scared him, started
  this cycle of fear.
- Olivia wondered then grabbed the Doctor's arm and turned him to face her.
- Stall these things.
- Know you're safe, sweetie.
- the Doctor asked and Rory pointed to one of the dolls.
- And you have to do it now!
- You have to open the cupboard, sweetie.
- We'll all be trapped here forever, if you don't!
- George please!
- I know you're scared but you can do it!
- You have to end this!
- Olivia grinned.
- It's ok, now.
- That's what the trigger was.
- He thought you were rejecting him.
- He thought you were rejecting him!
- How can we?
- She watched the way he was with George, remembering the way he'd treated another
  frightened young one in Cardiff the same way.
- She wanted so much to have a little one running around that TARDIS in a room made
  just for him or her, filled from top to bottom with toys and candy and anything
  else they wanted.
- Olivia grinned, shaking her hand.
- the Doctor greeted, stepping toward her and placing air kisses on each cheek of
  her cheeks.
- You sorted it.
- Good man, Alex.
- the Doctor reminded him.
- she smiled, handing him her Sonic Screwdriver.
- Just point and think.
- the Doctor called as they approached.
- Ali Baba.
- Come on, Rory.
- She lifted herself up on her tiptoes to press a kiss to his cheek.
- Something's scaring you.
- I haven't had those since I left.
- Theta, I know you're worried about me, believe me, I do.
- But I can't explain this to you right now.
- It's too much for me.
- She pointed to the first name at the top of the screen.
- Realistic.
- I ought to wash your mouth out with soap, using language like that.
- Olivia laughed.
- he murmured.
- the Doctor shot back, grabbing Olivia's hand to pull her toward the door.
- Planet of the coffee shops.
- Apalapucia!
- I give you sunsets, spires, soaring, silver colonnades.
- the Doctor frowned, approaching her.
- Olivia called, rushing toward the door as Amy thanked the Doctor and stepped back
  in as well.
- Rory asked as Olivia leaned next to Amy just as Rory came into the image in the
  glass.
- Amy asked.
- the Doctor blurted.
- the Doctor called, starting to work on the flickering image.
- The image remained bare.
- It was almost like their bond had never existed.
- There was nothing for her mind to grasp and hold on to.
- The bond's not there.
- Stabilized.
- Settled.
- Grown and grafted.
- Not born.
- I mean it's actually seeing with its fingers.
- Scanning the room.
- They saw Rory head for the door as Amy sat back in her chair and Olivia leaned forward
  on the table.
- Did you hear that, Handbot?
- She pressed the wrong button, that's all.
- We're aliens!
- Apalapucia is under planetwide quarantine.
- Walk into that facility, I'm dead in a day.
- Liv, time is faster on your side of the glass.
- Amy, you said you'd been here a week.
- It syncs up the two timestreams for visits.
- ! 'You''ve got a choice: Sit by their bedside for twenty-four hours and watch them
  die, or sit in here for twenty-four hours and watch them live.'
- Amy called, feeling at the stand before leaning forward to hold her head in her
  hands.
- They obeyed.
- Girls, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the TARDIS, like a satnav.
- I can use it to get a lock on you, then smash through using the TARDIS, to get you
  out.
- Small act of vandalism.
- That would be the small-act-of-vandalism alarm.
- Girls, I need you to go into the facility, just for a bit.
- Find somewhere safe and leave me a sign.
- Remember, you're immune to Chen 7, but don't let them give you anything.
- They don't know you're alien.
- Their kindness will kill you.
- the Doctor grinned, taking them off to put them on Rory.
- The Chen 7 will kill me.
- No regeneration.
- Never tried.
- Welcome Olivia Felton.
- For a taste of adventure, why not try the mountain zone and explore Apalapucia's
  famous glass-mirror mountains.
- Or try our rollercoaster zone, authentically modeled on the famous Warp-Speed Death
  ride at Disneyland, Klom.
- They soon spotted a Handbot on one of the floors and Amy hurried after it.
- Hey!
- Oi!
- Do not be alarmed.
- Olivia shouted as she pulled her back, two needles shooting at them and sticking
  into the corner of the bin.
- They hurried down the stairs into the underbelly of the facility and the Handbots
  followed as Olivia reached into her jacket pocket for her Sonic Screwdriver.
- Amy called as Olivia used her Sonic on another one and Amy grabbed her arm to pull
  her behind some cover.
- They ducked behind it and waited for a moment before peeking around it only to find
  a hand aimed at them.
- Amy shouted, dragging Olivia toward the vent and they both pulled off one of the
  screens to get in.
- Amy ordered, and the light disappeared as Olivia went to the console, using her
  Sonic on it.
- Amy echoed and Olivia looked to her in question.
- Olivia asked, listening to the high pitched whine that faded away after a moment.
- Messes them up.
- I'm sending a command signal to the screwdriver.
- Amy and Olivia are here, somewhere, if I can just get a lock on them.
- Red Waterfall isn't one timestream.
- I think they're happy to be alive.
- Rory shouted, backing up and crying out in surprise when he backed into someone
  else that pulled a huge stick up across his chest to hold him still.
- Peace!
- Olivia shouted, grabbing his arm and pulling him to one side as Amy thrust her sword
  into the head of the Handbot behind him.
- Rory explained, hurrying after her as Olivia trailed behind.
- Rory realized.
- I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone in my life.
- Rory asked the Doctor.
- Amy, come on.
- Do you have anything to say?
- she called back and sighed.
- I've never stopped loving you.
- I never gave up hope that you'd come for us.
- Number one lesson.
- So, no, I don't have a Sonic Screwdriver, because I'm not off on a romp.
- Rory wondered then replied.
- Or do.
- Rory asked Olivia.
- Rory wondered.
- But I soon realized that he didn't forget about me.
- Time is different for him.
- Thirty-six years for me is the blink of an eye to him.
- Take it from me, she'd never give up on the man she loves.
- Her pride is getting the better of her.
- she called before using her huge stick to hit the head off of the Handbot approaching
  her, but one got past her and touched Rory on the neck, knocking him out.
- I've worked out a way to hijack the temporal engines and use them to hold two points
  of the girls' timelines together.
- We're bringing them out of the then and into the now!
- Girls, I just need to borrow your brains for a minute.
- Amy snapped, making Rory and Olivia frown at her in disbelief as her Sonic Probe
  beeped.
- Rory snapped.
- I swore to protect you, Amy.
- Olivia ground out at Amy as she stood near her cot and Olivia marched toward her.
- At least then I'd be happy, and none of this will have happened.
- That's what you're refusing to see, Amy.
- And I swear, if you screw this up, if you do this and make me miss out on those
  thirty-six years I could've had with him, then you've declared war, and this facility
  will be our battleground.
- I want you to have the past me, Theta.
- We are now officially changing our own futures.
- Hold on to your spectacles.
- In my past I saw my future self refuse to help you.
- I am now changing that future and agreeing.
- Maybe if I shunted the reality compensators on the TARDIS, recalibrated the doomsday
  bumpers, and jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes…maybe, yes.
- It could do it.
- Future girls, you too.
- We need to get a signal through, and that signal will be a thought.
- Girls-now and girls-then, share a thought each, something so powerful that it can
  rip through time.
- Rory, Sonic the vent front.
- Inside you'll find three levers and a jumble of wire.
- That's the regulator valve.
- After we reroute it, you'll have ten minutes to get back to the TARDIS.
- Pull out the red and the green receptors.
- Reroute the blue into the red and the green into the blue.
- It's hardly rocket science.
- And girls, start thinking the most important thought you have ever had.
- No, I am.
- Rory!
- Olivia Two ordered, hurrying toward him to snatch them off his face and toss them
  away.
- the Doctor added.
- Rory, you've got eight minutes left.
- I'm sorry.
- Amy One handed Amy Two another stick strapped to her back.
- Rory called.
- Olivia One grinned as they ran for the side door.
- Rory pleaded with Amy One.
- How many games of doctors and nurses?
- Olivia Two called as all the doors suddenly opened and Handbots hobbled in through
  each one of them.
- Rory used the Sonic on the button leading to the gallery and the door opened, letting
  them all run through.
- Amy One shouted.
- she told Rory.
- My Highwayman.
- He took Rory's hand and placed it on the lock of the door.
- he ground out.
- But neither of you would listen.
- Olivia stumbled back, staring at the Doctor as he flew the TARDIS.
- Rory hoped and Amy nodded.
- I didn't die.
- I'm right here.
- I never want to see you die and be powerless to stop it.
- She could feel everything he was feeling in that kiss, and she felt the tears he'd
  shed against his cheeks and lips as she kissed him back, trying to comfort him.
- he grinned, making her frown at him as he stared at the screen, still grinning.
- She's adorable, really.
- And that smile is so sweet!
- the Doctor grinned.
- The craftsmanship involved.
- Rory asked, drawing Amy's and the Doctor's attentions to them.
- Walls that look like doors.
- ! '''Doorwalls,'' if you like, of ''Dwalls''…''Woors'' even, though you probably
  got it when you said they''re not doors.'
- the Doctor echoed with a grin.
- What kind of things?
- Interesting things?
- I love things ask Olivia over there.
- the Doctor began, pacing between them.
- Olivia asked as the Doctor walked around the spot where it had been parked.
- Olivia's secret revealed...coming soon!
- They were all laughing and having conversations, and the sheer creepiness of it
  all made her clutch the Doctor's arm as he stepped deeper amongst the tables in
  the dining hall.
- The dummies stopped laughing and talking to look at them as they stepped through
  the room, the rest of the group staying at the door.
- Be patient.
- I used to hate them.
- He laughed heartily.
- the Doctor wondered once they were back in the lobby.
- Gibbis wondered.
- Here comes a chopper to chop off your head.
- he called, making her turn wide eyes at him.
- I mean, sort of.
- she shouted, seeing him move to open the door of a room.
- Howie had been right, the place was huge.
- Olivia felt like they'd been going around and around in circles, and they probably
  had been.
- She watched the Doctor stroke the wallpaper, flick at the hallway lights, then look
  up at the ceiling to see marks on one the arches that the Doctor ran a finger over,
  making bits of plaster fall to the floor.
- He stopped there and examined the markings as Amy knelt down next to him to pick
  something up off the floor.
- she called, running into the nearest room as Rita wheeling Joe into another, the
  Doctor, Amy, Rory, Gibbis and Howie all piling into one.
- This was how he would find out her secret, and though she was sure he wouldn't leave
  her, there was a part of her that thought he might.
- the Dalek shouted at her, making her shove herself back against the door as it rolled
  toward her.
- Exterminate!
- It's alright.
- He came back.
- He saved me.
- And now, he's going to save you.
- As soon as we saw the planets in the sky, mom and I went down to the basement, Aaron
  was at home, and I prayed he was alright.
- We must have been down there for hours before we heard the Daleks outside the basement
  door.
- It was the scariest thing I'd ever seen, and that included the Cybermen that were
  running around everywhere a year or so before that.
- It shouted at us, and we thought we were gonna die, but then…it just floated away.
- It didn't do anything it just turned and floated back up the stairs.
- The shouting was what got me.
- she hoped.
- I mean, there is no cause.
- It's how we cope with trauma.
- He glanced to Amy then looked to Olivia who deflated and shrugged before he turned
  to Amy as everyone gathered around him.
- It took Luke first.
- It got him on his first day, almost as soon as we arrived.
- It's funny, you don't know what's going to be in your room until you see it, then
  you realize it could never have been anything else.
- I just saw mine.
- It was the gorilla from a book I'd read as a kid.
- My God, that thing used to terrify me.
- The gaps between my worships are getting shorter, like contractions.
- This is what happened to the others.
- And how lucky they were.
- It's all so clear now.
- I'm so happy.
- Gibbis snapped.
- The Doctor beckoned Olivia to follow him and she obeyed, coming up behind Gibbis
  to slap her hands onto his shoulders, making him jump with a start as the Doctor
  leaned closer to him.
- Now I see why.
- Your cowardice isn't quaint, it's sly, aggressive.
- That's how that gene of gutlessness has survived while so many others have perished.
- But not today.
- No one else dies today.
- We're all dead jealous so tell us, how do we get a piece of the action?
- It'd be so much easier if you just let it go, you know?
- Howie retorted.
- Everything…the rooms, Lucy's note, I mean, even the pictures in reception has been
  put here to frighten us, so we have to resist it.
- Do whatever you have to.
- Cross your fingers, say a prayer, think of a basket of kittens.
- Howie's voice echoed through the hotel.
- My master, my lord, I'm here!
- Come to me.
- I'm waiting, here, for you.
- He has promised me a glorious death.
- Rory asked Olivia, armed with a mop as they stepped toward the door of the spa where
  they were going to trap the Minotaur.
- His love was a beacon that led me from darkness to light, and now I am blinded by
  his majesty…humbled by his glory!
- I just think we should take things slowly.
- Get to know each other.
- You take people's most primal fears and pop it in a room…tailor made hell just for
  them.
- he asked it.
- So what are we?
- Cellmates?
- the Doctor questioned as the Minotaur growled.
- Replace what?
- Then tell me.
- he ordered.
- They rushed toward him and the Doctor knelt next to him to look him over, but it
  was too late.
- Olivia swallowed as she knelt down next to the Doctor before looking to one end
  of the hall, seeing Amy, Rory and Rita coming around the corner and the Doctor shook
  his head.
- Olivia screamed in rage, charging toward him but the Doctor gripped her arm to keep
  her at bay.
- Gibbis continued, cautiously following them.
- We've been in tougher scrapes than this, haven't we?
- Just got over this massive stammer.
- What an achievement.
- I mean, can you imagine?
- I know this probably isn't the best time for something like this, but I'm losing
  it.
- I just need you to hold me and tell me everything is gonna be ok, because I don't
  feel like everything is gonna be ok.
- Comfort, love, passion, reassurance.
- Olivia melted, wanting to stay in that moment forever but it was short-lived.
- he greeted.
- he hoped, ignoring her smirk and trying to hide his blush but it did no good as
  Rita shook her head in answer to his question.
- she elaborated.
- she asked when he stopped and looked around the hall.
- he asked when she answered the phone as Olivia still watching the screens.
- the Doctor guessed and Rita nodded into the camera.
- I can feel the rapture approaching like a wave.
- I don't want you to witness this.
- Rita, please.
- I'm blessed, Doctor.
- I'm at peace.
- I'm going to hang up.
- The Doctor slammed the phone back on the hook before slumping into the chair behind
  him.
- Olivia turned from the screens as the other three watched the Minotaur catch up
  with Rita, but the Doctor used his Sonic to turn the image to snow.
- After his destructive rampage he slumped into the seat against the wall at the table
  on the other side of Gibbis, Olivia standing to cautiously head toward him and sit
  in front of him.
- She reached across the table and took his hand, making him look up at her and she
  could see it in his eyes.
- Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with a horseshoe.
- He was a gambler.
- Gamblers believe in luck, an intangible force that helps them win or lose.
- Gibbis has rejected any personal autonomy and is waiting for the next batch of invaders
  to oppress him and tell him what to do.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy scoffed in wonder as Olivia turned to sit at the bar again, her back to them.
- Olivia screamed, tears instantly rolling down her cheeks as she backed away from
  the image.
- she confessed through her sobs, still trying to back out of the room.
- I can't do it again!
- she cried.
- He knew there was no other way, but he couldn't do it.
- It would tear her apart, but for the greater good, to save them all, he had to do
  it.
- When I brought you with me…you were never meant to fall in love with me.
- She let out a short sob before falling to her knees again, her heart breaking into
  a million pieces as she covered her face with her hands and sobbed.
- She knew this would happen.
- Olivia sobbed.
- It had changed to a grid, dark with blue lines to illuminate the dark room and when
  she looked up she saw the Doctor standing a few feet away from her.
- I hate you!
- she shouted, shoving away from him, lifting her left hand and pulling her ring off
  to throw it into his face.
- Or an alien Minotaur.
- he asked.
- Gibbis said, pointing through the glass he, Rory and Olivia were looking through.
- Gibbis asked as the Doctor stopped in front of the door.
- He stepped in front of Olivia as she still sat in front of the other door, her knees
  pulled up to her chest, her head bowed against them.
- He followed her in and stepped after her up the stairs, but when he headed toward
  the console, she turned to head up the stairs and deeper into the TARDIS.
- Rory had checked on her, and so had Amy, trying to assure her that the Doctor didn't
  mean what he'd said, but she knew better.
- Even if he had lied, even if he'd done to save their lives, she knew a part of him
  meant it.
- How could he not.
- Hating it when he regenerated was terrible.
- She tensed when she saw the Doctor standing in the doorway before turning to face
  her back to him, not wanting to deal with his rejection any longer.
- You don't want to miss their reaction, do you?
- He sighed and stood from the bed to follow her out, meeting Amy and Rory in the
  control room with Olivia.
- Real house.
- Rory wondered.
- Me standing over your grave?
- The Doctor hugged her in return, burying his face into her shoulder, trying to keep
  the emotions at bay, but he was ready to break after everything that had happened.
- He looked to the console to see Olivia at the scanner, making his hearts skip with
  hope but he remained calm as he made his way up the stairs, quietly.
- He was all the way around the console and stepping up next to her before she finally
  noticed he was there.
- She looked to him with those wide jade eyes and his hearts sank again when he saw
  fresh tears on her face.
- She looked away from him, but he lifted a hand and gently took her chin into his
  grip to pull her gaze to his.
- Her eyes slowly met his and her heart fluttered when he gave a small smile.
- Now, these questions are simple.
- I swear, Liv, it'll never happen again.
- She lowered her head into her hands, sobbing and he wrapped his arms around her.
- I shouldn't have said I hate you.
- she grinned in realization, throwing her arms around his neck to hug him.
- The Doctor remained where he was, admiring the sight of her rear before she stood
  and placed the fish fingers on the trivets she'd set up to let them cool.
- he laughed.
- he noticed.
- Olivia said nothing as she took a pancake and wrapped it around one of the fish
  fingers then held it up for him to see.
- Olivia called, reaching for a green sundress at one of the vendors, holding the
  Doctor's hand as they strolled the streets of planet Barcelona.
- She released his hand and turned to hold the dress against her, twirling around
  as she smiled cutely.
- Bowties!
- he grinned, turning to where he thought she'd been standing then frowned when he
  didn't find her.
- he grinned, planting a quick kiss to her lips before putting the fez on his head
  and taking a step back from her, straightening out his jacket then presenting himself.
- But before he could deepen the kiss, she pulled away with a smile and lifted a hand
  to stroke his cheek.
- He stared down at her in awe at how happy she looked, her smile bright, her eyes
  even brighter.
- It still amazed her that she had such an effect on him.
- Olivia called from the stairs, making him flip the screen off and look to the stairs
  with a smile, taking in her appearance as she leaned back on the railing halfway
  down the stairs.
- She frowned when he realized how tightly he was holding her, as if he didn't want
  to let her go.
- She'd felt that kind of hug from him before.
- she murmured, lifting her hands to cup his face.
- She hated the look she saw in his eyes.
- It was the same look he'd had when she'd met his future in Utah.
- I fell in love with an impossible man and got to travel with him in his blue box.
- Not many people can say that.
- Only River can say that.
- Now don't spoil this for us.
- He leaned in, deepening the kiss and this time she didn't pull away before he could.
- His tongue slid past her lips, and he smiled when he caught a taste of strawberry
  before their lips parted.
- I am not making Jack the rebound guy, and don't you even think of saying, 'He can
  give you the child I couldn't' because I'll slap you again, and then I'll drag you
  out that door and punish you some more, somehow, while we're at the Festival.
- Thank goodness!
- Joyce chirped.
- Joyce snapped, looking around at each of them as they all stared at her.
- Joyce called, and Aaron followed Olivia and the Doctor into the kitchen where Joyce
  sat Jack and Olivia sat the Doctor across from him at the table.
- Aaron did as he was told, trying to avoid eye contact with Jack, but he found it
  impossible.
- He watched Olivia go to the freezer, fussing over the Doctor before finally looking
  to Jack's clear blue eyes that glittered with the smile he gave under the towel,
  one eye winking at him.
- Aaron tried to fight the smile that threatened to spread over his lips, but that,
  too, became impossible and he let it show.
- Joyce snapped, cleaning up.
- Jack asked, and Olivia nodded again.
- Jack echoed, shifting to frown at her as she approached the table again and perched
  herself on the Doctor's knee.
- Aaron questioned, worry reflected in all their faces.
- I don't mean to do this to you but I wanted to let you know I'll be out of contact
  for a while.
- It's the least I can do for my family.
- he grinned, running around the console.
- The Doctor wrapped his arm around her shoulders to lead her down the dark street.
- I didn't see anything.
- I'm not noticing.
- the Doctor wondered as Olivia frowned at him.
- We're just here.
- the Doctor guessed.
- Good.
- Love to Sophie.
- Olivia called as he turned and pulled her back away from the door, but when they
  were a few paces away the porch light blinked, catching his attention and making
  him stop.
- Olivia snapped in a hushed tone as well before the Doctor stepped toward the door
  at the top of the stairs.
- Craig complained before sighing in frustration and stepping toward the crib, Olivia
  right next to him as the Doctor only stared at the crib.
- Craig grinned, heading toward Olivia to hug her, along with his baby then looked
  to the Doctor as he stepped toward the door.
- she frowned, adjusting the baby in her arms as he squirmed, excitedly.
- the Doctor wondered, sitting at the table as the baby started crying again, Olivia
  grabbing the milk carton he set on the table to put it back in the fridge.
- I need something.
- Craig replied, pacing around the table.
- I have no instinct!
- No, Stormy!
- He's your dad.
- Craig wondered.
- It's real.
- And next door, both sides.
- They're humans.
- Is it the fridge?
- We just came from her twenty-fourth birthday visit to her mum's.
- A bit of a farewell tour for me.
- We can't miss it.
- Literally can't.
- It's locked in a time-stasis field.
- the Doctor chirped.
- Good seeing you, Craig.
- Well, mostly because I doubt you would actually shush if I did it.
- He marched her out into the street, making her stumble behind him at his pace.
- What are you doing?!
- Something's happened, hasn't it?
- Stop noticing.
- Just go.
- Stop noticing.
- Am I noticing?
- Olivia called, and he turned to grab her arm, pulling her closer and making her
  gasp as he shoved her into the door of the TARDIS, pinning her there with his body
  and his burning gaze.
- Her breathing quickened as she met his stare, licking her lips.
- Going.
- Not staying, going.
- I am through saving them.
- the Doctor cheered, using the controller in his hands to control the helicopter
  in the toy store, a group of children around him, watching him as Olivia stocked
  shelves of toys nearby, smiling.
- Which I, personally, think is a bit steep.
- Ladies and gentlemen, while I deal with this awkward moment, you go and find your
  parents/guardians.
- So does Liv.
- Here to help.
- Look, they gave us badges with our names on them, in case we forget who we are.
- What about that?
- Craig complained, rubbing his eyes.
- He didn't get a wink.
- Craig demanded as the Doctor lay on his stomach, looking under something before
  standing again.
- Mystery solved.
- Goodbye.
- the Doctor retorted.
- Don't want to frighten the punters.
- Someone's been using a teleport relay right here in this shop.
- Craig questioned in disbelief.
- Craig frowned.
- Craig wondered.
- It's always been you.
- I was the one that told the Doctor we should come here.
- Would you like that?
- I know I would.
- he laughed and looked behind him as he was trying to escape her.
- Olivia replied as they caught the sound of marching and she shot her gaze up behind
  Craig.
- I remember from last time.
- People got killed.
- People that didn't know you.
- You always survive.
- Look at Olivia.
- Alright, maybe those days aren't quite over yet.
- Let's go investigate.
- People like it when you're with a baby.
- Babies are sweet.
- People talk to you.
- Val echoed as Olivia still tried to speak.
- Val questioned.
- the blonde girl, Kelly, snapped.
- Craig went on.
- Sorry, madam!
- Of course he does.
- Of course you do, Craig.
- Craig echoed.
- Cybermats are infiltrators.
- Very small, very deadly.
- They collect power like bees collect pollen.
- Olivia wondered.
- It's a coincidence!
- It happens.
- Olivia stepped forward to greet them, but the Doctor gripped her arm, making her
  turn a frown to him but he only shook his head.
- She nodded in understanding, stepping next to him and letting him wrap an arm around
  her shoulders to pull her close.
- Amy and Rory walked away as the little girl looked to her mother excitedly then
  pointed toward the Doctor and Olivia.
- he sighed.
- But I can't risk it.
- They're safe.
- the Doctor retorted in a hushed tone.
- Ten percent off.
- the Doctor shot back.
- I didn't know there was gonna be an invasion of Cybermen.
- Craig realized.
- The Doctor used his Sonic as a torch, leading them through the darkness.
- she called, shaking him.
- Craig called, hurrying toward them before kneeling next to the Doctor with Alfie
  as she looked up at him.
- Craig asked as Olivia let the Doctor lean on her to lead him to the exit.
- I say a lot of things.
- But I fused the teleport.
- Craig asked.
- the Doctor wondered.
- We've gotta go.
- the Doctor wondered, making Olivia shake her head and lower it into her hand.
- Craig replied before the door shut and Olivia couldn't help but snicker, shaking
  her head at the two of them.
- Go to sleep.
- Really, stop crying.
- You've got a lot to look forward to, you know.
- ! 'A normal, human life on Earth: Mortgage repayments, a 9-to-5, a persistent, nagging
  sense of spiritual emptiness.'
- No, that was old.
- But I am old, Stormy.
- the Doctor continued, lifting Alfie from the crib, sitting him on his arm to hold
  him to his chest as he squirmed.
- She had wanted that.
- To stand in a doorway unnoticed while the man she loved played with or rocked their
  own child.
- He looked up at the lights Alfie's lamp cast on the ceiling in the shape of stars.
- I think it's fair to say, in the language of your age, that I lived my dream, I
  owned the stage, gave it one hundred and ten percent.
- I hope you have as much fun as I did, Alfie.
- And I hope you meet someone as wonderful as Liv to help you live your dream.
- She's meant a lot to me since we met.
- Still does.
- he hoped as Alfie made a little noise.
- He'd wanted this.
- But he had always hoped it would be their baby, not someone else's.
- The Doctor would make quite an impressive dad, too, wouldn't he?
- the Doctor answered Alfie.
- It sparked again on the floor as the Doctor grabbed Olivia by the hand.
- Call Craig!
- the Doctor chanted before handing Alfie over to Olivia.
- she snapped, watching him blow into his hands and rub them together as she held
  onto Alfie.
- She glanced at the glass door, realizing what he was going.
- the Doctor replied, finding his Sonic on the floor and grabbing it.
- Olivia screamed as he caught it in his hands before it got to his face and Craig
  grabbed a metal tray from the stove.
- The Doctor aimed his Sonic at the Cybermat.
- You must be really, really strong!
- It was 'Playing Opossum' before, to take us by surprise.
- Ow!
- Liv!
- Smashing through glass like that!
- You could've used it on the door instead of smashing through glass!
- You're so reckless!
- the Doctor snapped, grabbing her wrists and looking into her seething expression.
- What's gotten into you?
- She didn't turn to watch his approach.
- But I didn't come here for an apology.
- I want an explanation.
- You're acting strange again, and you know how it worries me to no end when you act
  strangely.
- I know it has to happen, and I meant what I said yesterday—I don't regret anything
  but…I can't help but think about the things we won't have.
- I'm so afraid…of losing you.
- What will I do with myself after you're gone?
- I'll be inconsolable.
- I'll end up with my mom, and I'll never leave the house.
- Jack will try to set my up with people to cheer me up and I won't have it.
- A cat lady!
- I'll be one of those crazy old ladies that has a house full of cats and calls them
  her babies!
- Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing.
- You will not be a mad lady with a house full of cats.
- I know Jack and Aaron will be there to help.
- You have no idea how frightened I am.
- If I could, I would avoid this for…well the rest of my life, but I can't.
- The future me, I mean.
- he hoped.
- Just give us a mo.
- the Doctor shot back as Craig shifted Alfie in his arms.
- I'm a stupid, selfish man, always have been.
- I should've made you go.
- Craig laughed again.
- Craig urged.
- My time is running out.
- I don't mean Exodor.
- Silence will fall when the question is asked.
- Don't even know what the question is.
- I always knew I'd die still asking.
- The thing is, Craig, i-it's tomorrow.
- I can't put it off anymore.
- He sighed and smiled at the sight before carefully standing and placing a throw
  blanket over the two of them.
- I had to make sure…I wasn't dreaming.
- Back to the TARDIS.
- I'm almost done with this and then I'll join you in bed.
- We can snuggle up on the top bunk and she'll run a hologram of the stars we can
  stare at till we fall asleep.
- he wondered.
- They must've had a backup system.
- You're intelligent enough that they'll try to make you their Cyberleader if they
  haven't found one already.
- I'm protecting you.
- Craig called, making Olivia jump and look to the hall.
- Olivia!
- Where is he?
- Craig insisted, a scanner gun in his hand.
- They will be discarded.
- Olivia shouted as she and Craig rounded the corner.
- Craig shouted.
- the Doctor shouted.
- Craig shouted as they pulled him toward a machine.
- You will be like us.
- You will be more than us.
- Your designation is Cybercontroller.
- You will lead us.
- Take me!
- Olivia shouted, struggling to be free.
- Craig shouted in panic.
- I've reprogrammed their Cybermat.
- the Doctor shouted, struggling to be free of the Cyberman holding him back, but
  it was no use.
- the Doctor shouted to them, still fighting to be free.
- You're both strong enough.
- the Doctor ordered.
- Liv, think of your mum, and Aaron, and Jack.
- Craig pleaded.
- I've always believed, in all of you, all my life!
- I'm going to die, Craig!
- the Doctor called, sorrow thick in his voice.
- the Cyberman called.
- Oh, please, just give me this.
- Craig!
- You wanted your chance to prove you're a dad.
- He shoved the Cybermen away when they tried to take him as machines sparked around
  them and the Doctor pulled free of the metal man holding him.
- the Cybermen shouted.
- the Doctor reported, leaning down to lift Olivia in his arms and run toward the
  exit.
- the Cybermen shouted as they ran toward the shaft, but it was sealed.
- he shouted, running into it and he lowered Olivia's knees long enough to use the
  Sonic on the panel, making it spark before he and Craig wrapped their arms around
  each other and Olivia.
- You'll have a fit if I do.
- Craig hoped and she nodded, leaning her head on the Doctor's arm as she felt a headache
  coming on.
- You destroyed them because of the deeply ingrained, hereditary human trait to protect
  one's own genes, which in turn, triggered—Ow!
- Liv!
- Not to mention she's my wife.
- I know how soft they are.
- It all seemed surreal, but now…now it was more than real.
- It was too real.
- You've been quiet ever since we came back to tidy up at Craig's.
- But I won't pressure you.
- he smiled and she nodded again, letting him pull away to take her hand and pull
  her toward the TARDIS door.
- the Doctor grinned, shutting the door behind him.
- Craig asked.
- You're our mate.
- I notice Stormageddon's very quite and happy.
- Oh, he prefers the name Alfie now.
- she hoped, taking only what she needed and looking at him.
- I'll see you Craig.
- he called after her, making her stop and he stepped in front of her when he caught
  up.
- He lifted a hand and placed it under her chin to pull her gaze to his.
- I can't bear it when you're like this over me.
- I was here to help.
- she called in wonder as she stepped toward him.
- I want to know why.
- It doesn't matter if I know why.
- Losing you will break me no matter what I know or don't know.
- It won't make it easier to cope, and it won't make sense to me, because the universe
  needs you.
- I need you.
- and the scene from the lake is at the end again, from the Doctor's POV instead of
  Olivia's, so no skipping!
- you have to read it all!
- She didn't know where they were, or what led them there, but all he had to say was
  'Dalek' and she said she'd stay.
- He said he wouldn't be long.
- That was an hour ago, and she was starting to wonder if she should've just gone
  with him.
- The Doctor slammed a lever into place and the TARDIS shuddered to a halt before
  he grabbed Olivia's hand, the eyestalk in the other, and ran toward the door.
- She held tightly to his hand as he peeked around a corner at the cloaked figure
  that had passed them then followed it at a safe distance.
- They entered what Olivia guessed was some kind of tavern and inched closer to the
  Doctor, also guessing that the same sort of unsavory people hung around a place
  like this as they did on Earth.
- The man looked at the stalk before turning to a phone, lifting the receiver to speak
  into it.
- Olivia eyed the Doctor sideways, biting her lip as she did.
- Gideon froze, as if paralyzed as the Doctor lifted the Sonic toward his eye.
- So if you're posing as Vandaleur, you're investigating the Silence.
- The envoy's queen was alight with electricity, and if she remembered the rules right,
  it meant he'd moved it far too many times and he couldn't move it again without
  being electrocuted to death.
- The gauntlet on his hand would be no protection.
- the stranger snapped.
- Olivia sighed, stepping over something she thought might be a trap.
- She shouted in pained shock as Gantok lifted a gun toward the Doctor who whirled
  around at the sound of Olivia's cry.
- Gantok stepped forward, Olivia with him, and a door gave way beneath them, making
  them both scream as they fell through the trap door.
- The Doctor instantly knelt down and grabbed onto her hands, both ignoring Gantok's
  screams as he was buried in the pit of skulls below.
- That's it!
- Use your feet!
- Dorium suddenly called from his box, having been awakened by the commotion.
- Miss Felton!
- Thank God it's you.
- She swallowed once she was inside and went to the console to turn on the scanner,
  watching for the Doctor.
- Not a few moments later she saw him hurrying back with one of the boxes from the
  room and she could guess whose it was.
- Dorium shouted inside as the Doctor ran around the console to operate it.
- Olivia tried again, heading toward him as he stopped at the scanner and spotted
  his image on it, his name, death date, time and location next to it.
- Dorium asked from his closed box.
- We all have to die, Doctor.
- But you, more than most, you do see that, don't you?
- You know what the question is now.
- Olivia whispered, looking up at him and he met her gaze.
- the Doctor questioned him, stepping next to Olivia.
- Bit of a farewell tour.
- Things to do, people to see.
- There's always more.
- It's me.
- Get him.
- It's all still going on.
- For me, it never stops.
- Liz I is still waiting in a glade to elope with me.
- I could help Rose Tyler with her homework.
- I could go on all Jack's stag parties in one night!
- He'd written out the cards, and they were ready to be sent.
- She stood alone, having assured the Doctor she could do it herself without too many
  tears.
- You care for him very much, I can tell.
- Something stopped her.
- She wasn't sure what but she stood in her spot for a moment or so before something
  clicked in her mind.
- Belated, really.
- She scolded herself for not thinking of it sooner.
- She thought perhaps the Doctor might have even thought of it, but he hadn't said
  a word about it.
- they all cheered, clinking their glasses of wine, the Doctor holding the bottle.
- He couldn't help but stare at Olivia as she sipped her wine.
- This was the younger version.
- Bright-eyed and fresh from their honeymoon, still thinking she was keeping that
  one secret from him, and still unaware of what was to come.
- It made him wish he hadn't invited her.
- It's horrid!
- Olivia prompted, the Doctor realizing she'd seen one of the Silence, but he still
  remained quiet.
- It wasn't time yet.
- He reveled in the sound.
- he grinned, pointing to the moon showing itself early in the daylight sky over the
  lake.
- Of course, you lot did a lot more than look, didn't you?
- Big, silvery thing in the sky, you couldn't resist it.
- The Doctor gently nudged Olivia to stand, which she did, along with everyone else,
  and he waved to an old man that now stood outside the van and waved back.
- Clear?
- He looked to Olivia as she frowned in wide-eyed question and terror as the astronaut
  trudged out of the water.
- It's ok.
- This is where I die.
- This is a fixed point.
- This must happen.
- This always happens.
- Don't worry.
- You won't even remember this.
- Of course they can't!
- Dreadful woman.
- It's always the twenty-second of April.
- Her heart ached for him, and she had to resist the mysterious urge to hurry toward
  him…to be near him.
- The clocks never tick.
- ! '''Something has happened to time.'''
- That's what you say, what you never stop saying.
- ! '''All of history is happening at once.'''
- But what does that mean?
- What happened?
- Churchill asked.
- Churchill asked.
- Olivia asked, drawing his attention.
- she scoffed, and the Doctor only stared at her, willing her to do something, but
  she didn't know what…until she suddenly did.
- he asked the Doctor.
- ! 'Amy and Rory: The Last Centurion and the Girl Who Waited.'
- ! 'Olivia Felton: The Girl Who Never Let Me Go.'
- However dark it got, I'd turn around, and there they'd be.
- If it's time to go, remember what you're leaving.
- Remember the best.
- My friends have always been the best of me.
- Time is dying.
- It's going to be 5:02 in the afternoon for all eternity.
- Churchill echoed with a frown.
- Churchill demanded, lying next to the couple as well as a suited figure stepped
  between the men.
- She's on our side.
- It turned to anger as she turned a glare at Amy who lifted her free hand to wave
  two fingers toward Olivia over her shoulder.
- Amy complained, making Olivia cease struggling against her captors to stare at her
  with wide eyes.
- He heard a train whistle as the cloth was pulled away to be replaced with a cool
  hand, his fuzzy gaze focused on the ceiling fan above him for a moment before looking
  down, sensing someone staring at him.
- I wanted to avoid a long conversation.
- You need to get up, though.
- Amelia Pond from Leadworth.
- You were best friends with Olivia, too.
- You can see what others can't.
- He stumbled into the table next to the couch, grabbing hold of something square
  and blue, using it to emphasize his point as Olivia shook her head with a knowing
  smile.
- He frowned at Olivia when he noticed she was wearing the toga she'd been wearing
  earlier.
- she smirked with a wink, making Amy chuckle as the Doctor visibly blushed before
  grabbing Olivia's hand to pull her toward the door at the other end of the car.
- he guessed.
- Some of us noticed.
- There's a whole team of us working on it.
- Can I have an office?
- Never had an office before.
- Or a train.
- Or a train/office.
- What do you think, Liv?
- the Doctor grinned, hugging her in return.
- Amy guessed as she pulled away and stepped toward the desk to look through the papers
  on it.
- That's him, isn't it?
- I've no idea.
- Now look at it.
- Amy wondered.
- I'm it.
- Spinning round it is the planet Dupug and spinning round that is a Green Moon.
- There is a story that many generations ago a Demon was imprisoned on the Green Moon
  by a God.
- The Demon was said to have a face so hideous that anybody who saw it would tear
  their eyes out rather than see it again.
- It is also said that the key to the Demon's cell was given to Monks.
- A blue box materialised.
- The door opened and a tall figure stepped out.
- He shivered slightly.
- The Doctor leapt out of the TARDIS and spun around.
- I'm a Swukain.
- said the Doctor.
- He looked at the mountain and saw a building at the top of the mountain right in
  front of them.
- asked Kafyip, looking uneasily up the mountain.
- said the Doctor.
- He ran towards the mountain.
- Looking out was a tall and fiearce looking man with one hand replaced by a vicious
  blade.
- With him were 4 other humanoids, wearing masks of bone.
- They were the Sycorax.
- He smiled and gave a vocal command.
- There was a click and a red light flashed on the control panel.
- Guhi seized the steering control and began to guide the ship down towards the Mountains
  of the Gods, and the Monastry of the Green Moon.
- Under 20 metres away was the building.
- It had elaborate images on the walls and a silver lined entrance.
- The view showed a lake a few kilometres from the TARDIS and slightly beyond that
  a small town.
- said the Doctor.
- From it ran a man and 3 Sycorax.
- He looked at the 4 figures with interest.
- he said suddenly.
- said Kafyip.
- said Kafyip.
- Lost his hand in a failed robbery.
- The Doctor sprinted at the entrance but stopped and looked at a large green symbol
  on the gate.
- There was a bang in the courtyard.
- said a Monk.
- Like other people of this world he was tall and furry.
- he cried as a shot struck his chest, laying him low.
- The Sycorax all pulled out swords as Guhi walked towards the door.
- Another shot shattered the lock and a Sycorax began to push at each of the heavy
  doors.
- called the Doctor.
- The criminal turned and saw him.
- Guhi looked furious.
- snarled Guhi, pointing the infamous stab-hand at the Doctor.
- said the Doctor.
- He left the courtyard, and then a few seconds later came back.
- he said.
- Guhi raised his arm and fired a shot, the Doctor just leaping out of the way in
  time.
- He examined himself.
- he said.
- A Sycorax ran out holding a large intricately made box, covered in green and gold
  symbols.
- But before he could reach Guhi a stick flew through the air, knocking him over.
- While the Doctor had distracted the criminals the Monks had surrounded the criminals,
  and were brandishing tough looking sticks.
- laughed Guhi.
- he cried as a stick was sent at his chest, knocking him backwards winded.
- A Sycorax gave a blood-curdling cry and ran forward with its sword.
- A Monk stepped aside and the Sycorax crashed into a wall.
- It fell back with the bone mask cracked.
- Guhi knocked a Monk's stick away and slashed his shoulder, causing a horrible cry
  of pain.
- He took out his sonic screwdriver but a Sycorax suddenly knocked a Monk into the
  Doctor.
- The sonic screwdriver flew from his hand and across the courtyard.
- The Doctor ran about looking for it.
- shouted Guhi as he broke a Monk's nose.
- said the Doctor, looking around.
- The dazed Sycorax ran at the Doctor with his sword out, trying to regain dignity.
- Again he fell prey to his intended victim stepping aside.
- He stepped on the sonic screwdriver and was sent over.
- The Doctor laughed.
- The Sycorax groaned.
- The Monks moved back.
- 5 others lay wounded.
- Guhi began to walk to the ship but suddenly looked worried.
- he cried.
- He had seen 2 Police Vehicles on the plains.
- yelled a Monks.
- Guhi and the Sycorax ran towards the ship as the Police Vehicles neared the mountain.
- said the Sycorax, clutching his thigh.
- said Guhi, running over.
- There was a horrific scream, and the three crooks ran towards the ship, the Police
  Vehicles now very close to the mountain.
- They rushed inside; the Sycorax left there activated the controls, and the ship
  blasted off, while the Monks watched in a state of worry.
- asked Kafyip.
- said Kafyip.
- Anybody got a Jammy dodger?
- Kafyip looked embarrassed.
- The Monk began speaking.
- It turned out the Doctor had left his psychic paper in the TARDIS.
- The Doctor was being questioned by an Officer Honmeb and was giving a description
  of the criminals.
- said an Officer.
- said the Doctor.
- The Officer laughed.
- By now Guhi will be out of this side of the system.
- He left.
- Shortly after this the Doctor left also.
- Kafyip was waiting in another room when the Doctor entered.
- he said.
- someone cried.
- Kafyip and the Doctor looked round to see Honmeb running at them.
- said Kafyip.
- He slapped his head.
- Kafyip and the Doctor put on their seatbelts as Honmeb drew closer.
- The Doctor began to guide it down, the vehicle moving wildly.
- shouted the Doctor as the Hover-vehicle began to pull out of the dive, flipping
  upside down.
- cried Kafyip as he began slipping, but the vehicle flipped back up.
- The other one was closing in on them at great speed.
- The Doctor gave the steering handle a quick jerk and the vehicle crashed next to
  the TARDIS.
- The Doctor and Kafyip ran towards the TARDIS, the Doctor opening the door with a
  snap of his fingers.
- They ran inside, the door closing as the Hover-Vehicle began to land.
- The Doctor meanwhile was leaping round the console, pulling levers.
- asked the Swukain.
- said the Doctor.
- Kafyip thought, not reading the Doctor's mind.
- He ran to another part of the console.
- It was a barren place, with thin atmosphere and little mineral wealth.
- The Doctor turned on the scanner.
- he said suddenly, pointing at the screen.
- Kafyip looked at it, not understanding it.
- asked the Sycorax holding the box.
- Guhi glared at him.
- I am leading this exhibition.
- He made a threatening gesture with his hand.
- Within a hundred metres of a crater visible from Dupug the ship landed, causing
  creatures to scuttle away.
- asked a Sycorax.
- He pressed a button and the door opened.
- He opened the doors and bounded out, followed by Kafyip.
- The Swukain looked around and gave a yell as he saw something move.
- One of the creatures scuttled towards them.
- It was about as tall as the Doctor's knee, and resembled a spider with a tiger-like
  head on top.
- The Doctor sent a sonic wave towards it and the creature moved back.
- He ran forward and saw the ship.
- Guhi and the Sycorax were walking towards the cave.
- The Doctor and Kafyip ducked behind a rock.
- he cried as he glanced behind him.
- The Doctor turned around and saw a swarm of Green Moon Beasts scuttling towards
  them with frightening speed.
- He pulled out his sonic and tried to keep the Spiders back, but there were too many
  to hold back from them for long.
- The Doctor shivered.
- asked Kafyip.
- If they jumped out Guhi would see them.
- There was a crack and a cascade of rocks fell next to Guhi.
- He and the Sycorax turned to look at it, while the Doctor and Kafyip ran behind
  another formation of rocks.
- Guhi turned around and saw the Spiders scuttling along.
- he cried.
- The Sycorax fired a few shots, scattering the spiders.
- said Guhi, running into it.
- The Sycorax gladly obeyed him.
- They didn't notice the Doctor and Kafyip running towards the cave as well, though
  they stopped next to the entrance.
- The Doctor glanced round the edge.
- said the Doctor.
- I'll see if the prison is round here.
- We must find the prison before them.
- Kafyip walked through the cave and saw a lot of other stone structures.
- The criminals were just going into another one.
- He went back and found the Doctor using his sonic screwdriver on some spiders.
- The Doctor spun round.
- said the Doctor.
- He ran through the cave and saw the three enter another cave.
- He moved into the open and whirled around with his sonic screwdriver.
- he said, pointing to a hump of stone about 20 metres away.
- He and Kafyip ran in and saw at the end a metal door.
- It was over 5 metres tall, with a complex series of locks.
- The Doctor frowned.
- The Doctor walked towards the door but felt uneasy.
- There seemed to be a presence there, powerful and dangerous.
- Kafyip, with his telepathic mind, also seemed to feel it.
- He saw you enter that cave.
- Right.
- asked the Doctor.
- Guhi sneered nastily.
- He held it up.
- said Kafyip.
- Guhi moved closer and gave a menacing gesture with his stab-hand.
- said the Doctor.
- snarled Guhi.
- He raised his stab-hand.
- He examined the symbols on the box.
- asked Kafyip.
- But they are to this Galaxy what the Time Lords used to be to the Web of Time.
- cried Guhi.
- said Guhi.
- If there isn't anything behind this door… then this could still raise a lot!
- said the Doctor.
- said the criminal.
- He pointed his Stab-hand at the Doctor.
- said Kafyip.
- He looked very worried.
- said Guhi, pointing the Stab-Hand at Kafyip.
- The Doctor looked sad.
- The Doctor turned round and began to walk towards the door.
- But suddenly he turned back and whipped out the screwdriver, activating out.
- said Guhi.
- said Kafyip.
- There were meanwhile cries from the Sycorax as the Spiders attacked.
- One of the Sycorax fell back, hacking at the spiders as they moved closer, but they
  soon covered him.
- Guhi charged at the Doctor who moved aside hastily.
- Guhi stopped himself next to the door.
- He moved back and picked up the box, then ran back and pushed it into part of the
  door just above his head.
- A shockwave flowed through the cavern and the Spiders scattered back briefly, leaving
  two of the Sycorax wounded and the other dead.
- The door began to slide open and Guhi, laughing manically, moved back.
- The Doctor turned and saw something had moved round the door.
- It was like a hand but barely a hand, a hideous claw, with pale skin, like a creature
  barely alive.
- The hideous clawed fingers were pushing the door open.
- The Doctor and Kafyip strained but the claw was far stronger, and the sonic screwdriver
  seemed to be having no effect.
- Suddenly an idea entered Kafyip's mind.
- He moved towards the edge of the door, close to the claw.
- cried the Doctor, but Kafyip began to pull the box out, careful to avoid getting
  in range of the claw.
- Guhi ran forward in fury but the Doctor used his sonic again.
- cried Guhi.
- The blaster jammed and there was an explosion, tearing apart the stab-hand.
- Guhi screamed in pain and fell to the floor.
- Kafyip had nearly finished pulled the box out of the hole.
- One of the Sycorax staggered along wounded with his sword ready.
- cried Guhi, but the Sycorax stopped by him.
- he snarled, plunging his sword into Guhi's chest.
- But the dying Guhi pulled from the mangled remains of his hand the blade and gave
  a sudden slash at the Sycorax, severing an artery.
- cried the Doctor, holding onto the wall.
- The claw pushed against the door but was unable to open it.
- Kafyip sensed thoughts of great anger and brutality behind the door and moved back,
  narrowly avoiding the claw.
- He held onto the rocks while the dead Sycorax and dying Guhi were pulled towards
  the closing opening.
- The claw seized at them, pulling them in.
- Kafyip felt the final thoughts of Guhi slipping away.
- The bodies disappeared through the crack and the door closed.
- Kafyip looked at the door.
- They heard steps and turning, saw the remaining Sycorax, wounded badly, stagger
  out of the cave.
- said the Doctor.
- He scanned the door and examined the readings.
- said Kafyip.
- said Kafyip.
- He thought for a moment.
- I have got a lot of stuff tucked away in there.
- He placed it carefully inside the cave, got into the TARDIS doorway and sent a sonic
  signal.
- There was a powerful explosion and the Doctor slammed the door as rocks flew through
  the air.
- He opened it a moment later and saw the cave was sealed.
- The Doctor closed the door again.
- said the Doctor running through the TARDIS corridors and leaping down the stairs.
- The Monks of the Green Moon were thinking about the missing key box.
- Suddenly a grinding sound began and a large blue box materialised in the courtyard.
- The Monks surrounded the TARDIS as the Doctor stepped out.
- He held it up.
- Though I think one is still alive.
- asked Kafyip politely.
- The Monk moved forward and looked at the Doctor.
- You seem a suitable Guardian for the Key box.
- You may keep it.
- said the Doctor slamming the door.
- The sound began again as the TARDIS again began its journeys.
- Officer Honmeb ran up.
- The Old Monk turned and smiled.
- He has taken our box for safe-keeping.
- Honmeb looked angry.
- But he knew he couldn't get the Doctor.
- It could see it in the distance.
- Suddenly it heard a swishing sound overhead.
- The Sycorax looked up and saw a spaceship overhead.
- A voice boomed out.
- The Sycorax knew it couldn't fight.
- Within a few minutes it was in a cell on the Police ship.
- Soon the news was out.
- With his fingerprints he unlocked the door and placed the box inside a slightly
  larger box attached to the floor which he had to first tap a 5 digit code into.
- Kafyip watched outside.
- said Kafyip.
- He left the room and slammed the door shut.
- he said.
- He opened the door again and looked inside.
- He walked down to the console room with Kafyip following.
- he said.
- Before Kafyip had time to answer the Doctor had an idea.
- He ran round the console flicking switches and pulling levers.
- It inspired me to expand on it.
- Oh, the little girl looked horrified.
- So, the faster he could get them out, the better.
- Had to make sure they were all okay.
- Make amends for this body, if he needed to.
- He'd have no opportunity again.
- He couldn't let her die.
- Yet there'd been no other way, no time to find a better solution.
- Wilf thought that she was settling for second best.
- But she was still Donna.
- All that marvelous potential was still there.
- Still waiting.
- He'd given her the winning lottery ticket just to free her up from the limitations
  of a day to day life.
- It wasn't even the big jackpot.
- He grinned inside to think of it.
- They belong to the BBC, no matter how much I beg and plead Steven Moffat!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, very angst!
- I'm actually liking it so far.
- Finally putting her true feelings out in the open.
- The man standing in front of her had saved her from so much, she couldn't go on
  without him at least knowing.
- She was a mess, an absolute mess, but this was the last they would ever see of each
  other.
- He said it like it had been obvious.
- Did that mean he felt the same way?
- His eyes were threatening to spill tears onto his soft cheeks.
- The pain and anguish of knowing this moment was soon to end was evident on his face.
- This was it, the words she had been waiting on for so long.
- Maybe she could carry on with the rest of her life if he just said it.
- She would hold on to this moment, forever knowing he felt the same way.
- Her breath hitched as hot tears streamed down her blotchy face.
- She cupped her hands over her mouth, grief overcoming her.
- Gone.
- He was smiling that cheeky smile of his.
- She was only human after all.
- She would grow old eventually, leaving him behind.
- she shuddered at the way her name rolled off his tongue.
- It was beautiful, as was the rest of him.
- She couldn't help but be attracted to that gorgeous face of his, and to the fact
  that he said she could spend the rest of her life with him.
- Her stomach sank.
- He looked so sad and sincere.
- It broke her heart.
- She could never let him go, never forget all the fantastic days they spent together.
- Her mother rushed to her side, wrapping her into a crushing, yet comforting hug.
- Her body racked with unending sobs.
- She could care less how terrible she must have looked to the others.
- Her life was over.
- They belong to the BBC, no matter how much I beg and plead Steven Moffat!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- The first part is called Drowning.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, very angst!
- I'm actually liking it so far.
- ! 'Her mind was filled with unimportant things: the mail needed to be checked, the
  pool needed to be cleaned, her car needed a wash.'
- Did she really want to know?
- She was just being a good mother, taking care of her daughter.
- Jackie opened her mouth to speak, but quickly closed it, contemplating how best
  to phrase what she had to say.
- Will NEVER.
- Move on, Mum.
- Jackie shouted, finally letting out the pent up emotions.
- I had to work to make a livin, and so should you.
- Her entire life had been flipped upside down.
- ! 'She hated it: hated feeling like this, hated feeling so grounded so stranded,
  hated that he''d left her.'
- ! '''Course, she knew it wasn''t his fault, not really.'
- She wandered if he still blamed himself, wondered what he was doing right now.
- But then that burning pain in her chest once again found her, and she had to stop
  herself from bursting into tears.
- I know you want me to...
- At least, not yet.
- I just want what's best for you, is all.
- But Rose knew that wasn't going to happen anytime soon.
- She was sinking.
- Her mother couldn't understand.
- They go to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- The first part is called Drowning and the second is called Sinking.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, very angst!
- I'm actually liking it so far.
- Rose asked.
- Pete Tyler, Rose's stepfather and director of the Torchwood team, sat opposite Rose
  at their dining room table.
- He slid a folder across to her.
- It was filed with documents explaining the job.
- Rose frowned.
- Pete asked.
- You wouldn't be receiving any special treatment from me.
- Rose usually called him Dad.
- She only referred to him by his name when she was angry or serious.
- Rose then crossed her arms, not saying anything.
- He stretched across the table and grabbed her hand.
- She glanced over at the large manilla folder next to her, overflowing with information
  on Torchwood.
- She looked at Pete, the man who had become such a great father to her and was so
  sincere about wanting her to work for him.
- She was so lucky to have so many people in her life who would care that much about
  her, let alone put up with all her angsty mood swings.
- Mum, Dad, Mickey; they all just wanted what was best for her.
- They go to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe and any original characters she meets there.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- The first part is called Drowning, the second is called Sinking, and the third is
  called Floating.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, very angst!
- I'm actually liking it so far.
- She pulled out her ID badge and made her way back up to the field ops bunkers.
- He interrupted.
- Your training starts in a week.
- Her training had been a brutal two months of vigorous workouts and long hours.
- The field ops team often went weeks without going home, spending their nights in
  the field operations bunkers.
- Rose had never felt so exhausted, but she loved it.
- She had both her loving parents, a rambunctious little brother, incredibly caring
  friends, and a great job.
- All these thoughts were running through her mind as she rode the lift back up to
  the bunkers.
- The double doors opened to the darkened room.
- That's odd, Rose thought.
- She assumed there was at least someone on call tonight.
- They shouted in unison.
- Mickey pushed through the crowd and kissed Rose on the cheek.
- Knew you couldn't keep away from it too long.
- Roady smiled, a gap-tooth grin.
- He was one of the one's who trained her.
- He'd lost both his parents on Cybus Day, the day the Cybermen invaded, and dedicated
  his life to defending the earth ever since, which he did through his long standing
  job at Torchwood.
- He was in his late 30's and very good looking, according to most of his female co-workers,
  but Roady had never bothered with a relationship.
- Until he met Rose.
- He always fancied her.
- Ever since Torchwood Director Tyler had introduced his mysterious young daughter
  to the Torchwood team, Roady had been smitten.
- She had averted his question and sort of ran away, leaving him in the dust.
- She was sort of...involved, and hasn't really gotten over 'I'm yet.
- He sounded like he knew from experience.
- The misunderstanding of their first awkward encounter soon faded, and the pair became
  fast friends.
- They had done a lot together over the past two years, dealing with aliens and saving
  the universe.
- Roady considered Rose to be his best mate.
- Sometimes though, he could still sense her evasiveness, like she wasn't always telling
  him the full truth to things.
- Still, that didn't matter right now.
- She teased, playfully punching Roady in the arm and swiping her new V-phone out
  of his hands.
- She turned to address the rest of the group.
- A makeshift disco ball hung in the center of the large room, reflecting multicolored
  lights off the hanging party decorations.
- Rose sauntered through the crowd, thanking everyone she ran into for doing this
  for her.
- Finally Rose made it through the herd of people, coming across the refreshment table
  set up in the back.
- She poured herself a glass of the punch.
- he said.
- She shouldn't be upset.
- She had everything anyone could ever dream of, right here.
- But she longed for the past.
- It's wonderful.
- Brilliant, actually.
- she chose her words carefully.
- Roady was one of the few people she had entrusted with her secret life in the other
  universe, the one where she had traveled with him.
- But she hated talking about it, especially to Roady.
- It was just too painful.
- Roady hated hearing about the cryptic Time Lord almost as much as Rose hated talking
  about him.
- He wished Rose could just let him go.
- She would be so much happier if she would just let herself.
- It hurt him to see her so miserable sometimes, all because of him.
- I's a party!
- ! '''Cause right now, you are surrounded by loads of people who care about you and
  you are missin'' it!'
- You're so bent on the past, you can't see the present.
- Look around you!
- All these people are here 'cause they love you and wanna see you 'ave a good time!
- Well, except for Mitch.
- He was right, she knew he was right.
- Ugh!
- Why did this have to be so difficult?
- he mused, bumping her shoulder.
- she straightened up, setting her now empty cub down onto the table.
- They go to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- The first part is called Drowning, the second is called Sinking, the third is called
  Floating, and the fourth is called Swimming.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, will become very angst!
- I'm actually liking it so far.
- Jackie explained, bouncing her two year old son on her lap.
- She shouted.
- Pete said, trying to deflect Rose's anger away from her mother.
- He stood from his chair, gesturing toward the balcony.
- he was offended that she would thin he could ever hide that from her.
- Roady had just cheered her up at the refreshment table, promising her a night of
  fun.
- He had pulled her into the crowd, dancing and laughing and all together, having
  a fantastic time.
- Rose WAS having fun.
- About an hour of this madness ensued.
- Soon, the crowd began to dwindle, as people did have families to get back to.
- Only the single, late-night-party-lovers remained, some dancing, some just sitting
  together and enjoying a few drinks.
- Mitch Wilkinson, who was obviously more than a little drunk, was explaining the
  misadventure of his last field assignment to the group.
- Oh, no.
- Blasted creature ran away, lost it we did.
- Rose chided in.
- said Martha, who was starting to get a little bit tipsy from her drink.
- Caroline his tea, and you know how scatter brained he is.
- He picked it up so fast, I thought he was going to spill it all over the cannon!
- Rose interrupted, speaking what everyone else was surely thinking.
- she stopped herself, realizing that some of the other table members might not have
  clearance know the story of the parallel world in which Rose came from.
- She turned back to Rose.
- She pushed her chair back roughly, not even excusing herself from the table.
- She had to find Pete, now.
- Caroline in charge of the project?
- He's 'round the bend!
- he yelled back, using his most intimidating Director's voice.
- He never called her agent Tyler and he never yelled at her like that.
- Maybe she was being a bit too brazen.
- He began explaining in a much softer tone than moments ago.
- Dr.
- Caroline was the one who helped us invent the first dimension hopper, back when
  we were tracking the Cybermen.
- When we discovered they were damaging the walls of the dimensions, Dr.
- Caroline began trying to fix it, make it larger and more withstanding...and he did.
- He started building about six months ago.
- We've been testing it on rats and such since then.
- She put her head in her hands, shaking her head in shame.
- ! '''Cause you know why?'
- It works, Rosie.
- a slow smile crept up on Rose's face.
- Pete told her, happy to see joy on his daughter's face once again.
- This is going to be a little longer than I thought it would be, but I'm sure you
  will enjoy it.
- Oh, and I completely forgot to tell you guys the song that inspired this whole thing!
- Its called Drowning by Love and Theft.
- Go check it out!
- And go check out my other story, The Doctor's New Adventure!
- Find it on my profile and write a review!
- They go to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- Warning, will become very angst, but I'm actually liking it so far.
- James Caroline and his assistant, Dr.
- Martha Jones, stood behind the plexus-glass wall that separated the dimension cannon
  from the controls.
- His time weathered hands were shaking profusely as he wrung them together.
- Considering this was the first time they were going to use the cannon on a human
  being, let alone the Director's own daughter, he reserved the right to be a little
  nervous.
- Caroline believed it wouldn't work, of course.
- No, he head worked too hard and too long not to have faith in his invention.
- Rose was standing in the next room talking to her mother.
- Jackie was happy for her daughter, but she was also concerned for her safety.
- he told her.
- Jackie laughed and scooped him up into his arms.
- she asked, in one last ditch effort to persuade her.
- She could never separate those two, nothing could.
- Not even the universe, apparently.
- Jackie had hoped Rose would move on and find someone else, but that was not the
  case.
- Not even with that Roady bloke, who was so obviously head over heels for her.
- Oh well.
- Dr.
- Caroline called.
- he handed her a square package covered in green wrapping.
- she hugged him tightly.
- You know, that stuff that reads body temperature and keeps you warm or cool, dependin'
  on the climate you're in?
- I asked Teresa from inventory if I could have some, 'n I got the jacket custom made.
- Rose pulled the jacket on, stood, and struck a pose.
- Roady laughed.
- I've got a week of prep, though.
- There was a pause of awkward silence.
- he asked cautiously.
- she vowed.
- Roady knew exactly who she was talking about.
- He didn't want her to leave, especially if she was never coming back.
- she told Dr.
- Now the hand-held is only for emergencies.
- On the slight chance that something should go wrong here at the control base a light
  will flash, signaling for you to use it to get back home safely.
- Dr.
- Caroline exclaimed.
- ! 'The tracker was inserted to do just as it implies: track your whereabouts.'
- It will always let us know where you are so we can keep a hold on you.
- he turned to Martha Jones.
- Pete Tyler spoke from his seat in the back for the first time.
- Switches and buttons were pushed and pulled.
- the room was bathed in a blinding white light, causing everyone to shield their
  eyes.
- Caroline who was hunched over Martha's computer.
- A heavy silence hung over the room as they waited for results.
- Loud cheers erupted from the scientists as the hugged and congratulated each other
  on a job well done.
- I hope it's making sense, please tell me if it isn't.
- They belong to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- I was running into some plot bunnies for The Doctor's New Adventure and thought
  why not?
- I'll write it down.
- However, I have updated The Doctor's New Adventure, so go check it out!
- Warning, will become very angst, but I'm actually liking it so far.
- Jackie groaned and rolled over in her bed, unwrapping herself from her husband.
- he answered into the receiver groggily.
- A few minutes of listening to the other end, then Pete straightened up, no longer
  tired.
- Jackie slurred sleepily.
- Pete pulled on his shoes and turned to face his wife, a stern serious expression
  on his face.
- Dr.
- Dr.
- You see, the cannon isn't indicating any malfunctions from the machinery itself,
  and no fluctuations in temperature like the last time.
- About an hour ago, I was running a scan through the system, just to check and make
  sure everything was in order, and I found an alert.
- Dr.
- Caroline was solemn.
- He pulled a second monitor closer.
- Pete was faced with the same map, only with a hell of a lot more star systems than
  the previous one.
- What Dr.
- Caroline was trying to tell him finally sunk in and it made him feel sick.
- Dr.
- Got here as fast as I could.
- Caroline pulled the two computer screens close together, showing them both to Rose.
- Mwahaha cliff hangers, how I love them.
- Two updates in one day, hows that for awesome!
- Having a bit of insomnia and my fingers were itching to type.
- Please favorite and review, it would make me soooo happy!
- They belong to the BBC!
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- he muttered grumpily.
- Roady shouted, causing Rose to jump.
- He stood from the bench and began pacing.
- It makes me sick, how much you fawn over 'im, like he's a god or somethin'!
- Well he ain't that special, you know!
- Roady shouted, frustrated.
- She had a feeling this was where his rant was headed, she had just prayed it wouldn't.
- Roady was her mate, nothing more.
- He HAD to understand.
- Roady interrupted, once again rising.
- That's bullshit, Rose!
- What I understand is that he isn't reliable.
- He's not around all the time.
- I will.
- You need someone who will be there for you, and that isn't him.
- he knelt down and took her hands in his, squeezing tightly.
- She swallowed hard.
- He means more to me than anythin' in the whole universe, in any universe.
- Those few words hurt more than anything else.
- Now he knew his place he was just that awkward guy who just happened to run into
  the Famous Rose Tyler one day, nothing more.
- I get it.
- she yelled, heartbroken at loosing her friend.
- hot tears spilled from her eyes as she crumpled back down to the bench.
- Roady had been the one she would go to when she needed help, tho one she trusted
  more than anyone in this world.
- But now he was gone.
- she whimpered to the empty air.
- They go to BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur in this story.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- That's what you get for being so stupid.
- Rose hadn't come to their daily scheduled lunch date since he told her those three
  little words four days ago.
- He hard hardly seen her these last few weeks due to her business with the dimension
  cannon, and lunch had been something he looked forward to.
- But now he wasn't seeing her at all and it made him feel like crap.
- He just needed to see her!
- To talk to her and explain things.
- He sighed.
- Mickey Smith called, a little too cheery for Roady's liking.
- He and Jake Simmonds took their seats at the table with their lunches.
- Stubborn as a mule, that one.
- Jake asked, shoving a large bite of chips into his mouth.
- he asked, obviously knowing Roady was talking about Rose.
- he confessed.
- You just gotta give 'er some time is all.
- he shoved another chip in his mouth, officially ending his advice-giving.
- Suddenly his phone vibrated with a loud ring.
- Sorry, lads.
- Gotta run.
- Let me give you some advice, you know, speakin' from experience 'n all.
- Rose is a great friend, the best mate I ever had.
- But when we dated, it just felt like we were doin' it out of obligation.
- he paused.
- Anyone could see it.
- Mickey agreed.
- You can't compete with that.
- I've tried.
- At first, I was going to cut this chapter, because Rose isn't physically in it at
  all.
- However, I thought it was important to see Roady's POV after their fight and how
  he deals with it.
- Plus, Roady hardly makes an appearance in the next few chapters (Sorry to disappoint)
  and I felt like his character would just end on a cliff hanger if I didn't add this
  so Ta-Da!
- Not sure how often I will have access to the internet, so not really sure when I
  will be updating either of my stories again, but don't loose hope!
- No internet just means more time to actually write!
- I'm estimating around 20 chapters for this story.
- Wow!
- Was not planning for it to be this long, and I would love to know what you guys
  think about it!
- They belong to the BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- Caroline called from the control room.
- Dr.
- The moment when she could finally see The Doctor again.
- Rose closed her eyes, ready for the jump.
- London, by the looks of it; Christmas time, judging by the decorations Rose noticed.
- There was a commotion some ways away and a large crowd of people were gathered close
  to the Thames, along with an ambulance and military vehicles.
- Rose moved closer, wondering what was going on.
- She saw a man in an official-looking red cap talking on a radio, but he was too
  far away for her to hear clearly.
- Maybe she had made it back after all!
- She ran toward the bustle, almost running over a woman with ginger red hair.
- she asked the woman, desperate and out of breath.
- the woman answered.
- She was back, she HAD to be!
- Dead?
- No, no he couldn't be, there had to be some mistake!
- The ginger asked, concerned.
- she whispered.
- This couldn't be right, her Doctor couldn't be dead.
- Something was wrong here.
- she reached out and touched Rose's shoulder.
- Rose felt something tingle through her at the woman's touch...and it was not a good
  feeling.
- She wondered just who exactly this woman was.
- the woman replied.
- Rose felt uneasy in this universe, especially since The Doctor was dead.
- That shouldn't happen...couldn't happen.
- that was when she saw it.
- There was something on Donna's back, something very very not good.
- She needed to get back to Torchwood and figure out how to move forward from this...unspeakable
  tragedy.
- maybe she was imagining it, but she could almost feel time around her then, and
  she knew this couldn't be home, not the earth she had lived on.
- It was twisted and corrupt somehow.
- she asked.
- You're doin' it now!
- What is it?
- Donna twisted to look at her back.
- Rose took this opportunity to pull the hand-held out of her pocket and press the
  button.
- She was instantly transported back to the cannon platform, safe from Donna's questions.
- I think I found another parallel world.
- Seems normal enough, but I think something bad is about to happen.
- The words choked out of her mouth.
- Disappointment was evident on everyone's faces.
- I dunno what it is, but she is connected somehow.
- She knows The Doctor, I can feel it.
- Caroline frowned.
- Caroline paused in thought.
- I'll be able to post more often than I thought.
- They belong to BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- She had barely whisked herself out of London before a flying ship crashed into Buckingham
  Palace, destroying the entire city in its wake.
- Rose checked her watch, which was specially equipped to tell her the date, as well
  as the time wherever she landed.
- she heard a voice from behind.
- She spun to see Donna, just the girl she needed to see, walking up the street.
- she asked.
- It was easier than trying to make Donna understand the truth.
- she asked, although she already knew all about this woman.
- Donna Noble, born to Geoff and Sylvia Noble in Chiswick, London.
- Donna asked suspiciously.
- That was when she heard it, that strange chattering noise.
- She had heard it the first time she saw that thing over Donna's shoulder, the thing
  that made her head hurt just looking at it, whatever it was.
- She tried to act nonchalant.
- That didn't sound good.
- The woman turned, trying to look over shoulder at her back.
- Nothing much, I s'pose.
- That did it.
- I've been to your future.
- It's pretty complicated.
- But she didn't voice this aloud.
- Rose told her instead.
- Rose didn't answer.
- Donna continued.
- Donna turned and walked away.
- Rose sighed as the dimension cannon lights flashed and cracked.
- She disappeared back into the alleyway, hopeful that Donna Noble would take her
  advice and leave the city next year.
- They belong to BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- Donna Noble sat in a car arguing with her mother about whether to turn left, or
  turn right.
- Just down the street, the other Donna would be changing history right about…Rose
  checked her watch…right about now.
- The cars began stopping, causing a traffic jam.
- There was only one thing left to do now.
- She walked down the traffic stopped street and found the other Donna, sprawled in
  the middle of the street.
- A crowd had begun to gather around the accident, but that didn't mind.
- Rose knew that with the end of this world, everything would go back to normal.
- Liking it so far?
- Leave me a review, even if it's anonymous!
- I love hearing feedback from you guys.
- They all belong to the BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- Rose was already prepared to jump back to her rightful world, the world with The
  Doctor in it, but her mother was tagging behind her.
- Off in that parallel world all by yourself, with God knows what sort of characters.
- You never stopped to check in once!
- She crossed her arms.
- The entire planet has MOVED, mum, and nobody knows how.
- It was after hours, but Martha had assured Rose she would make it past the security
  camera's in the lift.
- Now if only she could get rid of her mother.
- She had no idea how Jackie had found out Rose would be here tonight, or how she
  got in, but she sure was persistent.
- It's never about us, or anyone else for that matter.
- It's about you!
- You're not really trying to help, all you care about is getting back to him!
- I ain't leavin'.
- Rose rolled her eyes as she stormed through the doors, startling an already jumpy
  Martha Jones.
- Martha's eyes widened as she spotted Jackie Tyler.
- She sat at the controls, ready to being the jump.
- She mumbled to herself.
- Jackie asked, keeping her voice low so Rose wouldn't hear.
- Jackie raised her eyebrows slightly in agreement.
- Caroline is wrong.
- I mean, we can't make it any worse.
- Look, we have no idea what's going to happen if…when all the stars completely disappear,
  and people are bound to start noticing sooner or later.
- From what I've heard, I think this Doctor-person is our only chance, and I know…she
  is the only one who can get 'im.
- I haven't even met the guy and I know.
- She pushed a few more buttons, initiating a slow humming from the machines.
- The two women were silent for what seemed like hours.
- Jackie interrupted.
- She definitely did not want to stay on her bad side.
- Jackie rose, leaving Martha behind with the computers.
- Listen, I need your help.
- I need you to help me go get her…I don't care if you two are fightin'!
- I hate that she risks her life for 'im just as much as you do.
- She's my daughter, and I want her safe...Please, Mickey.
- If you won't do it for her, do it for me…good!
- she hung up the phone, pleased with herself.
- And I wondered why, if they are such good friends, Mickey went back with Jackie
  and not Rose.
- ! 'My reasoning is this: since the stars are going out rather quickly and the dimension
  hopping is too dangerous and hasn''t produced any results, the Torchwood scientists
  have decided to shut the project down.'
- However, that isn't going to fly with Rose.
- She has to find The Doctor and will do whatever it takes to get back to him.
- So she recruits the help of aspiring young scientist Dr.
- Martha Jones to help her get there.
- She knows she'll probably need some help, so she calls Mickey since her and Roady
  aren't speaking.
- Mickey doesn't want to help because he also thinks it's too dangerous (and is still
  a bit jealous of The Doctor) and they fight about it.
- After Rose decides to go alone, Mickey calls Jackie to warn her about Rose is doing.
- Jackie goes to Torchwood to stop Rose, but of course that doesn't work.
- When Rose leaves, Jackie calls Mickey and recruits him to help her go after Rose.
- Make sense?
- Hope so.
- They all belong to the BBC!
- James Caroline.
- Forgive any time flubs that may occur.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- She knew if she found Donna again, she would find The Doctor.
- But her grandfather and her mother had no idea where she was, they hadn't heard
  from her in days.
- Rose was defeated.
- She sat in the Noble's living room, unsure of what to do next.
- They were Rose's last hope.
- The sub-wave network is open; you should be able to hear my voice.
- Rose called.
- In the top right, Captain Jack Harkness was smiling.
- He hasn't changed a bit, Rose thought.
- Next, in the bottom left, Sarah Jane Smith.
- Harriet said.
- Harriet Jones was giving up her life to bring The Doctor back.
- Rose needed to do something.
- She lifted her mobile in the air dialing the number she saw on screen.
- she said to Sylvia and Wilf.
- He pulled his mobile out of his pocket and dialed.
- She begged softly.
- Please.
- It was him!
- They did it!
- Jack yelled at him.
- That must be Torchwood.
- Aren't they brilliant?
- Rose whispered, desperate for him to hear her.
- But she knew he couldn't.
- Donna laughed.
- Rose cursed.
- She would NOT lose him, not again.
- She was determined to do something.
- She did it.
- Please remember that I do not own Doctor Who, nor any dialogue from the show.
- Hope you are enjoying reading this.
:endParagraphs:
- Apologies for this chapter, this isn't going to be based on the actual episode Christmas
  Invasion, many apologies.
- He gave them a smile, and started walking around the Console.
- With the sentences, her voice got stronger, maybe even more harsher.
- Eliza said, walking over to her.
- The Doctor said, wondering if she had some sort of memory loss from the Time Vortex.
- All big ears and short hair and leather, a lot of the time moody, but friendly?
- she whispered so only he would hear her.
- Rose asked eventually.
- he asked hesitantly.
- Back and forth, back and forth…
- Eliza felt them stop in the Time Vortex, then go flying again, but in the opposite
  direction.
- Rose asked.
- The Doctor teased.
- Rose denied.
- Rose yelled at him.
- Rose ordered.
- Rose cowered.
- Rose barked.
- Rose asked.
- Answers only she could get from herself.
- She took a pen, and began writing out the letter in front of her.
- All these questions, so few answers.
- She looked further back than that, but failed to see any photo's of her- well, one
  of future her, but no her- nor did she see one of Rose.
- she screamed at the Universe.
- She walked quietly up to the Powell Estate, knocking on the door.
- On the TV, slap bang in the middle of cameras and microphones, was Harriet Jones,
  dressed for business and ready for action.
- Rose asked her mother.
- Eliza and Rose smiled at each other, remembering what she's done for her country.
- It took her roughly an hour to reach the destination she was told, but she knew
  it was the right place just by knocking on the door.
- she asked as she stepped in the house, Wolf jumping up at her and licking her face
  and hands.
- she asked, sarcasm dripping from her voice as she dragged her eyes from the TV.
- Someone more.
- The Golden Trio.
- She was with Rory, and that was all that mattered.
- It's written by my best friend and I and I hope you like it!
- Thinking like that would get you nowhere.
- He sighed and hung his head.
- But the universe had other plans.
- He almost heard the TARDIS berating him in his mind.
- He was so sick of being a Time Lord.
- She turned around to the sound of yet another wolf whistle from one of her extremely
  mature colleagues.
- She gritted her teeth and emitted a low growl from her throat.
- Yeah, she was deep like that.
- She soon drifted off into the abyss
- She thought bitterly.
- Little did she know, that this was going to be the complete opposite of normal.
- He eyed the distant reaches of space and allowed himself a small smile.
- he asked.
- the Black Guardian asked smugly.
- He had a pursuer.
- The only one who seemed to know of his existence was the other version of himself,
  but why would he be pursuing him, instead of being pleased by his removal?
- His own TARDIS had excellent shields and a deadly weapons array,
- She'd be right to as well, he knew.
- He frowned and reluctantly decided that he'd have to do it the hard way.
- there.
- With a small smile, Aislynn crept out and left him to his fun.
- he asked, wondering why both women were giggling a bit.
- Rose was wearing jeans, boots, and her favourite purple leather jacket over a blue
  t-shirt, but then, she'd been up all night working on the equations.
- she shot back.
- Alarms began blaring at once, the Cloister Bell donging loudest of all.
- Even the sound of the alarms was distorted, like they were wailing through a very
  long tunnel, or from the bottom of a well.
- Additional alarms started screeching, joining the first.
- Rose shouted.
- She couldn't quite believe it.
- Rose gasped.
- Rose insisted and the others nodded.
- the Doctor shot back.
- She didn't want to, but Owen needed more help than she could give.
- she typed.
- She was feeling very nervous just then.
- he told them and Rose nodded, picking up his part of the piloting.
- Susan asked, shouting over the alarms, as she ran diagnostics on the ship.
- Susan's TARDIS was a hospital ship; she had no weapons.
- He frowned and drew upon his experiences in the Time War.
- Rose asked.
- They went silent and inert as they slipped past the now harmless mines and headed
  out towards the Master's position again.
- Rose crowed and he grinned.
- He didn't understand what the other him was thinking.
- he asked Adie as she struggled to her feet as well.
- He had to understand what the other him was thinking.
- Leave the girls alone and stop this, before someone gets hurt!/ Before Susan gets
  hurt, he really meant, but he doubted the Master would need clarification on that.
- He'd channelled his rage at all he'd been driven to do, into saving as many as he
  could from the same fate.
- Why was he not coming to Susan?
- /
- Just get Susan out of the blast radius./
- Let the girls go already!/ he sent back, now more confused than ever.
- It made no sense.
- He had no expectation that the damnable wanker would actually go, but he doubted
  that anything he could say would talk him down at this point.
- he asked her, eyes bleak.
- Adie leaned over his shoulder as he worked, watching the scans, intent on the data
  that spooled by and then suddenly jabbed her finger at the screen.
- He felt his hearts stuttering as the data poured across his screens.
- She was staring at the information, looking perplexed, but he was trying not to
  hyperventilate.
- Kimberly just needed a lot of reassurance.
- she was asking him and he showed her Adie's schedule again on the notepad.
- Adie was a name he could invoke to keep them all calm.
- He wasn't sure how Adie was going to feel about this when they got back someday,
  but he also couldn't exactly warn her.
- the Doctor muttered and Susan just nodded, still stunned by it all.
- The Master was trying to shake them off but hadn't managed it yet.
- She hid the hurt of that deep, away from Koschei.
- No matter why he was doing this, she would spend eternity convinced it was her fault,
  that she'd driven him away to his death somehow.
- /You break her hearts, you wanker, by dying on her, and I will follow you to the
  other side just to kick your skinny arse!/ he sent with a feeling of savagery that
  he knew came from his own conflicted emotions.
- ! 'Immediately following: /That was not what I meant to do!/'
- The other version of him had interrupted his concentration at a critical moment.
- He was doing this all, literally, on the fly, while at the same time taking extreme
  manoeuvres like steering his own ship into the worst patches of lightning, knowing
  that the pursuing TARDIS would have to go around them, since it lacked his heavy
  shielding.
- He watched in frozen horror, knowing it was already too late to stop it.
- They were rebounding off of a misplaced chunk of time.
- Susan shouted, pointing to where the Master's TARDIS was trying desperately to slingshot
  out of the effects of the field.
- and sucked down.
- The TARDIS disintegrated the moment it touched the barrier, destroyed down to the
  last atom; only to be remade on the other side, almost exactly as it had been before.
- They were nearly exactly as they had been before, but not exactly where they had
  started out.
- Now inside the Möbius Loop closest to the implosion, they were falling above a white,
  snowy world, with howling storms and raging winds; and above all, a terrible and
  bitter cold.
- The Trans-Möbius barrier had shorted her systems and drained her power and she lay
  in her crater, steaming, as the snow fell around her and melted from the heat of
  her re-entry.
- The field didn't dissipate until they were nearly at the ground, and then they were
  flung in every direction.
- There was nothing left on this moon to challenge them.
- It was a gleaming, glowing spot of energy, space bending outwards away from it,
  like a bubble.
- Another beetle emerged from behind it, and a third from behind those, each moving
  out of the way of the next in line, drifting lazily towards the nearby moon.
- All around it, other beetles landed and began doing the same thing.
- Finally it landed some five feet away from where it started and crouched, buzzing
  angrily.
- Two identical beetles stood in its place, seeming to be stunned for a moment, before
  flying off in opposite directions and taking bites of new stones.
- The silent flashes were quite lovely to look at from a distance, but weren't visible
  for long, as the beetles quickly burrowed themselves an impressive crater.
- Other Kza, attracted by the commotion, came to investigate, and the swarm rose in
  its full fury.
- A series of disconnected chunks of rock floated in its place, growing smaller and
  smaller under the swarms of beetles that coated them, flashing and sparkling in
  the darkness.
- Kayla watched their back and Diana popped up on the other side, setting up a withering
  crossfire that took out what was left of them.
- It looked like a tunnel of light that just appeared from nowhere, shimmering in
  a rainbow of hues that made his head ache a bit if he stared at it too long.
- Jake just grinned.
- She tried to scream but her body was still only partially assembled and no sound
  came out.
- She thrashed in the enclosed darkness before she got control of herself and forced
  herself to be calm.
- There was a brief moment where his world was filled with a horrible grinding and
  cracking noise and then the surface beneath him shattered and he was dumped into
  blackness and cold.
- His clothes turned into weights that were pulling him down, his ears registered
  pressure, and his body was growing numb, his vision coming in a series of flashing
  vignettes.
- He took in deep icy lungfuls, trading one pain for another and then dragged himself
  onto the ice and lay still a moment, coughing up water, before his cold-numbed brain
  finally fathomed that he really needed to get off of the ice and out of the cold
  air.
- Far below he saw streaks of black, white, and grey, but could make no sense of any
  of it, he finally came together about ten feet above the ground, with just enough
  time to feel the bitter cold, before a heavy wind rose up and smashed him into the
  ground.
- He coughed and forced himself off of the snow with trembling arms, his hands sinking
  into the powder with a crunch as he pushed himself up.
- He blinked and realized that they had fallen into one of the Loops.
- It was long abandoned and now only a series of girders, angled crazily, as if they
  had been knocked about by giants, was all that remained.
- Gouged out ravines and tumbling foothills stretched out from where he stood, but
  no signs of cities, or craft of any type.
- She threw her arms out desperately for something to slow her fall and grabbed at
  a blackened branch that stuck out of the wall.
- With more haste than grace, she leapt at the wall of the ravine, nearly bouncing
  off again, but managing to cling like a limpet to the surface, her feet seeking
  the ledge.
- A storm was howling and shrieking, and the ledge was narrow and gave her far too
  clear a view of the yawning chasm below her.
- /Plus, I'm in my jim-jams and a robe!/
- That would be a horrible idea.
- She was huddled under a table while bullets whizzed by and bombs blew up around
  her.
- They all crawled under and Jake looked around.
- he asked and the girl nodded.
- Everything, the bodies, the fires, it was all gone and the building was even back
  in one piece.
- The other girl blinked and raised her own hand.
- 74's eyes widened and she stared at them in shock.
- His Time Lord biology was already working to warm him up and heal him, but he wasn't
  feeling particularly marvellous just then.
- This wasn't good at all.
- She was trying hard to keep her fear in check, but he could sense how scared she
  was.
- She was digging from sheer bloody minded stubbornness, feeling like a worm in the
  dirty snow.
- Jenny and Jamie's faces were there before her and she struggled towards them.
- It was a damn good thing she was a Time Lord now, she decided, because otherwise
  she'd be rapidly turning into a Popsicle.
- He had no guidance, and so he fell back on his standing orders from his Mistress.
- She lashed out with a foot, while firing at another and grinned as the rest of the
  revolution arrived a moment later.
- It was a fragment of a war and the only people she'd had to interact with, would
  forget her again, once those twenty-three minutes were up.
- She had a name, a purpose, and the one thing she'd needed most of all.
- There were more angled, random beams around that he had to navigate as he ran for
  Susan.
- He struggled up an icy slope, slipping and stumbling as he went, slapping his hands
  against his arms, trying to stay warm.
- Susan was very far beneath him.
- ! 'And there was no shelter from falling debris: if Koschei dislodged the wrong
  pebble, it could split her skull.'
- She pulled her hand back and watched as snow blew in to fill it up instantly.
- She would, even with her lovely Time Lord respiratory system, run out of air.
- She couldn't quite reach her husband, but the shining golden cord that stretched
  between them was like a shimmering bit of thread that she could follow home.
- The control room was black as pitch, as all the lights were out; but medi-bay was
  running at about forty-eight percent power, with all supporting equipment on-line.
- He needed to get more power or the babies would soon cease to function.
- He looked around and saw another and then, farther away, two more.
- They slipped into gestalt without thinking, putting their minds together to save
  them both.
- With a soft smile, he began slogging in the direction of this wife.
- It snapped into focus suddenly and she jumped back in horror, a scream tearing out
  of her throat.
- She stood there, frozen by more than the cold, for a long time, afraid to move.
- She was wading through the dead, all alone, freezing cold, and wondering where the
  hell they were and how they were going to escape.
- She watched Jake-77 and Diana-37 mounting another one just ahead, while London-11,
  Madison- 17, and Kayla-8, shared a third.
- Very little in this Loop could take on an Efapan and live, as slow and generally
  placid as they were, if they were forced to fight, they could trample most other
  creatures under their massive hooves.
- Tella-19 asked her.
- Long, sleek, and deadly, they were the only real predators the Efapan were in danger
  from and Sophie did not want to have to walk across the Waste, if she could ride.
- She's been run off as a replacement just days before they'd been sealed into the
  Loops and had far less experience than the others did.
- If your longest relationship was two and half days then you didn't have much to
  go on.
- She looked back at Tella-19, realizing that with the other Mashas and Jake; she'd
  finally have a chance to find out.
- Koschei was sure he could do this with little problem, and then, as he was digging
  around for a particular gear, he found the first frozen human skull.
- The parts were there, buried all around him, but digging them out was going to be
  bad.
- He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her back, so glad to see her that it took
  him a while to realize what he was lying on top of.
- he shouted and jumped to his feet, pulling her up after him.
- She felt her skull and winced as her cranium informed her that it was not happy
  with her.
- her thoughts trailed off.
- She had a mild concussion.
- Even better, among the field of debris were scattered old fuel barrels.
- The barrels weighed more than she did, but with a great deal of effort she could
  roll them around.
- Had it been any other fuel, setting the barrel on fire would have merely resulted
  in a rather crispy Adie and a nice exothermic reaction, but she had worked with
  tenzonite back on the station, so she knew how to handle it.
- She was trying to place them around the old wrecked shuttle, hoping that someone
  would see the light.
- When she was done, she planned to bring another barrel inside and light it for warmth.
- Other than that, this world was empty and dead.
- She had a seventeen hour block of hell that was home to her.
- Strangers that looked like her, which was, of course, utterly impossible.
- She looked up and saw the looks of understanding, of sympathy, and compassion, in
  the faces of the girls that all looked like herself and she found herself nodding.
- she asked suddenly.
- Diana-37 told her and feeling shy and out of her depths, 20 twisted a lock of her
  brown hair around her finger.
- No matter how many times it died, it was always happy to see her.
- They were considered disposable and unimportant to the Daleks and had been thrown
  at the Time Lords and their allies as though they were chaff.
- Only the warm, loving glow of Susan's mind to keep him company.
- He'd carefully kept the details of his efforts away from her, protecting her against
  the enemy that all doctors fought with every particle of their being.
- To him, it was a beautiful sight.
- It rose, hovered, fell, and then rose again, it was unsteady and the engines would
  probably not last more than an hour, but he didn't need more than ten minutes.
- He popped open the cab's door and smiled.
- he called and she leapt lightly into the Drone's interior.
- she teased back, though her chattering teeth and blue tinged lips worried him.
- He kicked the dragon in the throat, which was a rather large target, she mused,
  and it gagged, spitting the girl out.
- Nikki-69 ran under the beast's belly and drove her spear up into the soft underbelly
  with a grunt of effort.
- Cassidy-9 called and they all moved forward to help.
- It's not much, but it's something, I've lit fires all around, can you find it?/
- She didn't know how to continue.
- Blinking, he looked around, trying to determine where he was… and then froze.
- He felt for his laser screwdriver, but it was gone, no doubt thrown clear when they
  had crashed.
- He gasped and struggled in the water, wondering what was going to kill him first,
  the cold or smacking into one of the rocks that littered the river.
- He coughed up more water, feeling as though he'd swallowed half the river, and then
  he flopped over, coughing, and soaked to the skin.
- He snarled, pounding his fist on the hard packed ground.
- Cursing to himself, he got up and headed out, leaving icy footprints in his wake.
- It also sounded like Koschei and Susan had found a way to travel and keep a bit
  warmer.
- It wasn't much, but it was more than she had had before.
- Maybe she could use the screws, drive them into the wall and hang fabric up, insulating
  them even more.
- A disk?
- she whispered.
- she dared them all, her voice calm and her smile utterly feral, and they all stepped
  back, looking at her with mingled respect and terror.
- Kimberly-21 asked Jake in an undertone and he shrugged.
- the Shaman announced and they all looked around at each other and shrugged.
- A long squat shape bristling with weapons, she looked like what she was, a battering
  ram to be used against enemy fleets.
- After several rounds, beetles stopped coming through.
- Invading in uncountable numbers, the weapons of the Cassiopeia knocked gigantic
  holes in the swarm, but the wall of beetles was so solid that the batteries couldn't
  punch through.
- Every gun battery swung around, but the large beetles were surprisingly agile for
  their size, and well behind the smaller beetles.
- The tide began to turn in the favour of the Cklil.
- Their forms shifted and merged, and then they were no longer there; in their place
  was a single, gigantic beetle, dwarfing the Cassiopeia.
- The wasps had selected their own chunks of wreckage, and everything was quiet, bright
  with the sparks of constant divisions, until there wasn't a speck left, and the
  swarm, now becalmed, moved lazily on.
- It wasn't much, but it was more than they'd had before.
- Susan asked softly and he nodded.
- Still, she was swimming in it.
- He looked around and tossed a few broken crates out, to lighten the load, and then,
  with a quick prayer to whatever gods watched over engineers, he launched the battered
  and bedamned Drone into the sky.
- the Doctor was shouting and ranting as they marched.
- he continued, slapping his arms against himself and dividing his attention between
  his rant and Rose's lips, which we a bit more blue than he liked.
- he concluded and decided that the rant had done well at both the tasks he's set
  for himself, it had relieved his worry a bit, and it had warmed him up.
- Rose snarked back.
- At length, she was rewarded with a couple of old uniforms, with shoes, a first-aid
  kit, an emergency blanket, and a few other goodies.
- You should be pretty close to them./
- He wasn't so much piloting, he mused, as doing a series of controlled crashes.
- Do try not to get crushed./ Susan sent out.
- He fired and the arrow sped out and buried itself in the Brontosaurus' eye.
- She grinned at Diana-37, her hair wild and messy, all the little braids in wild
  disarray, her clothes ragged and filthy and Diana-37 grinned back.
- It bounced once and then stopped, listing to one side, before a hatch popped out
  and Susan, ginger hair matted and filthy, dirty face beaming atop a neon yellow
  plastic suit, waved to them.
- she called and the Doctor bodily lifted Rose from the snow and ran for the Drone.
- See the lovely dead world of wherever-we-bloody-well-are!/ he snarked back, obviously
  in a foul temper.
- I believe this is the location of one of the Rani's, shall we say, overly successful
  experiments./
- /I can't believe I ever dated that stroppy cow!/
- /Really, really, stupid./
- She was really very curious to know just how stupid the Doctor had been with the
  Rani, but it would be impolite to ask.
- I never thought it might have been added to the Möbius Loops, although it makes
  sense now that I think about it./
- Cheapskates./ She grumbled.
- And the Rani… I have to give her credit, I heard she came pretty close./
- Anything, up to and including the real-world interface of a TARDIS, to be able to
  chew their way from the outside to the interior./
- A disk that you should see./
- Of course you can!/
- /I'll be along shortly and we can chat, eh?/
- I have fires burning, I'll keep an eye out for some tea./
- He brought it down on its belly and let the ship ski across the snow, allowing friction
  to slow it to a stop.
- The fire danced and the light cast long misshapen shadows across the snow.
- The barrels made it warm enough to allow everyone to get out of danger of hypothermia
  or frostbite, but it wasn't anything resembling warm.
- Adie had tried to put as much of a brave face on things as she could; but the plain
  fact was that they weren't going to be able to spend the night here, and by the
  time they all got dressed and warmed up, it was going to be straight-up night time.
- Somehow, Adie knew it had taken days for them to die.
- her grandfather scolded, shocked.
- The man who'd once been the Master, shivered, eyes filled up with remembered horror.
- Koschei twined his fingers through hers, sharing that rage.
- Rose murmured, sounding worried.
- The others joined her quickly, but they all worked in silence, without their usual
  banter.
- Diana nodded beside him and he could feel her frustration as well.
- The Brontosaurus in Marissa's Loop had lasted them a couple of weeks, especially
  when they'd been able to freeze-dry chunks of it in Shevia's frozen Loop.
- she sighed.
- she asked the questions that he'd been asking himself as well and he shrugged.
- He wanted to get a good look at the area and needed to be as high as possible to
  do it.
- Susan asked and he shook his head.
- Rose objected.
- Koschei, Rose, and Adie all froze for a moment and then Koschei touched her shoulder
  lightly.
- She was a doctor, she should be more useful than this.
- She shivered and they all nodded.
- The wind was threatening to blow him away, but he clung doggedly, even in the teeth
  of the gale, pointing the sonic screwdriver as if he were a wizard trying to dispel
  the weather.
- When it hit there would be no travelling, and their makeshift shelter would be blown
  to pieces.
- He noted the position of a large crashed ship, before he turned to examine the anomaly
  more carefully.
- ! 'Good news: there''s another ship nearby, a bigger one, if we can get in there,
  I think we can weather the storm./ He paused, trying to think of a gentle way to
  say this and failing terribly.'
- /I wouldn't bet against it./ He tried to keep a brave face for them, but it was
  almost physically painful to relay the message.
- Nothing would be safe from them.
- Within minutes the larger members of the Manifold were covered from antennae to
  wingtip with the tiny hornets, stinging furiously.
- The stars winked out of sight as the sky filled with clouds of black and silver.
- For a while, the streaks of black and silver were approximately even; but the rain
  became darker and darker as drifts began piling up like black snow.
- The silvery clouds drifted almost peacefully before settling onto the surface like
  mist, digging through snowdrifts, hives, and buildings, sparkling and glittering
  as the world wore away underneath them.
- He was filled up with secrets, with closed doors, and sharp jagged painful memories
  that he had chained up, down deep in the darkness.
- Even so, her own knowledge was being pooled with the others, as they literally 'put
  their heads together' to brainstorm.
- It was weirdly comforting to feel their calm acceptance and the way they were already
  thinking about how to solve it, how to save lives.
- The wound was obvious in Susan's vision, and Adie focused her attention on one point.
- They've found it./
- Tearing into the fabric of time and space was destroying many of the creatures,
  but they were completely focused on their task, regardless of the casualties.
- but without him, they were doing the best they could.
- It was this phenomenon which had caused the Doctor to abruptly 'hang up'.
- It was too small to have much intelligence on its own.
- If it recognized him as a threat ...
- It stared at him with unreadable compound eyes, and then casually cleaned its antennae,
  before flitting away into the storm.
- /
- There's a storm kicking up, so hurry./
- Survival first, he decided.
- It was mostly buried and he spent some time digging at the door, using the sonic
  to help, trying to get it unsealed.
- Susan began methodically wrapping limbs, while Adie tied the rags on with strips
  of torn cloth.
- Rose agreed.
- They pulled fabric across their faces and started out.
- They'd obviously died in the crash, there was no sign that the Manifold had gotten
  inside, but they'd been terrified at the end, he could see it in the way they were
  lying, the out-flung arms, their mouths open in eternal screams.
- He grit his teeth and began dragging the remains of the crew away, into the soft
  deep snow, where they wouldn't be seen again.
- The ship had lost one of its wings, but seemed to be in good shape otherwise.
- Still, it was out of the wind and snow and that was the most important part.
- /I'm going to try and restore some power if I can, see if I can get some life support./
- / Koschei warned.
- This thing is half-buried anyway, I can do some additional burying, try and mask
  off any heat signatures, that is, if we can get power./ After a few minutes he added,
  /Koschei, I might need your help with the power./
- He stepped into the ship and nodded at the Doctor.
- He tried a different angle, pushing hard, but he simply didn't have quite enough
  strength to shift it.
- They grabbed it together, leaning and pivoting at the same moment and the chunk
  made a horrible grinding noise before it shifted and they were able to move it aside
  at last.
- Koschei suggested and the Doctor grinned.
- He grabbed chunks of wreckage, rocks, and downed trees and dragged them against
  the protruding hull area, working quickly.
- He stood up and saw that the horizon was a solid wall of white, coming this way
  fast.
- Rose, Adie, and Susan were slogging towards him.
- If the storm took them, even ten feet from the door, they would never make it inside.
- he called and they ran forwards.
- The wind was shrieking audibly even through the hull.
- Lights came up, heat began to trickle in and Koschei, grease stained and filthy,
  crawled back up.
- Rose cried with a broad grin and hugged him.
- Susan took her turn next, kissing him sweetly and grinning up at him.
- Rose grinned and nodded.
- she suggested.
- She had a backpack full of the furs though, just in case.
- She was baffled by the furs, but Shevia-48 was nearly as feral as a wolf herself,
  so Tamara-61 didn't say anything.
- Sky-52 asked Mica-41, whose Loop this was.
- Tamara-61 was wondering if anything ever ruffled Mica-41's calm demeanour, when
  she abruptly jumped to her feet and started walking.
- She'd spent hundreds of years here, learning everything about the thirty minutes
  and fifty seconds of this war.
- Sky-52 asked, pointing at a soldier crouched in the underbrush.
- She checked anything that might be a container, especially items like lockers, looking
  for food mostly.
- Susan shouted back and trotted down to where Adie was waiting.
- Huddled together, they could sleep, their combined body heat keeping them all warm.
- By mutual consent, they put Adie in the middle, with Susan and Rose on either side
  of her, and the Doctor and Koschei on the outside.
- Dawn was coming and a faint pale light was relieving the endless gloom.
- He had ventured too close and it lunged.
- He looked down and saw that the hand had been snipped cleanly away.
- It was sheer luck that he hit the weak spot just over its eyes, disrupting its cortex,
  causing it to burst into countless tiny beetles no larger than a quarter.
- He pointed the blaster at the stump where his hand had been, and fired.
- There was no way, no way at all that the other him hadn't felt that.
- He could feel the dawn rising and also the echoes of the Master's pain.
- It was beyond ridiculous, but there it was.
- They were both being torn up by this.
- After a moment, he got up as well and went to help her.
- His grip on the blaster, pried from the fingers of a long dead corpse, was not as
  steady as he would have liked.
- It had taken him awhile to figure out that the 'girls' referred to the clones he
  had scooped up and he still had no idea why the other him wanted them so much, but
  he was running out of time and options.
- Surely, he could see that.
- She had the successful version; she certainly didn't need the one who'd failed her.
- He turned his head away from his own dismembered hand lying on the ground, worried
  that he might become ill again.
- This is undignified enough as it is./ And painful enough, but he didn't say that.
- I am a little too busy to bother being petty, just now!/ he received in return and
  the fear and concern his other self was feeling for Susan was clear in his communication.
- I'll give you the clones, just get her.../
- The Swarm couldn't be anywhere nearby or he'd be facing a dozen of them.
- The blaster could disrupt the Wasp's core matrix, but he had to hit it just right
  to do so.
- It bumped him hard, sending him stumbling against the wall; and then its stinger
  was through his left shoulder.
- He snapped off the shot and it slumped, the core matrix disrupted.
- If the swarm had picked that up… if they were coming...
- /I'm coming!/ she called out, concern for him overriding all other thought.
- Koschei asked her, gasping, and she looked down.
- His shock was palpable to her and then she felt his gentle resignation.
- She had to find the Master.
- She was as frantic for his safety as she would have been for Koschei's and she didn't
  know what to make of that.
- She pulled the gloves on more securely and bent her head to the wind, trying not
  to think about what she was headed towards and what she was leaving behind.
- He could see how much she loved him from the outside and it was wonderful.
- her grandfather protested and anger surged in him.
- The passage of time was hard to judge in the Loops, but he was fairly sure that
  he hadn't been passed out for more than a few minutes.
- Susan was out there somewhere, in danger, and he had to do something.
- With his foot, he probed the snow for the blaster, each movement sending searing
  agony through him.
- Dying first was getting things in the wrong order.
- he shouted into the teeth of the wind, the bitterness in his hearts far more painful
  than his physical wounds.
- A chance to be free.
- She rarely saw her ship in its raw TT Capsule shape, but the Chameleon Circuit must
  have failed with everything else.
- Her ship, her dear friend, was weeping in her mind, calling out to her and she wanted
  to go, to help, but the Master wasn't much farther along and she couldn't leave
  him either.
- He was pinned to a wall, struggling to free himself, tearing his wound open further
  as he did so.
- It was like going back to that time, looking at him now, and then she shook herself
  and hurried forward, scolding herself for wool-gathering when he was bleeding.
- It wasn't much, but it would do to patch him up so that she could get him to the
  TARDIS.
- he croaked and she looked up at him and nodded.
- But when he opened his eyes, the hallucination was still there.
- He'd had the image of those green eyes burned into him for so long, that it had
  nearly supplanted all that had come before.
- He was having a psychotic break, then.
- He could see her, but the idea of her touching him, and then fading away into the
  mists of madness, was unbearable.
- she gasped, seeing the stump for the first time.
- But he had to stop the Manifold, he couldn't weaken now.
- she pleaded, but he shook his head.
- She was looking at him and her eyes went wide and filled up with a sudden terrible
  sorrow.
- He wanted her near to him, not far away, but he had to stay clear in his head.
- Tears burned and her throat closed up, as she choked back the sobs that threatened
  to break out of her.
- She didn't know what to think or how to feel about that.
- He gritted his teeth, braced himself for what he had to do, and pulled himself away.
- He permitted himself an inexcusable moment of rest, gasping.
- His hearts were beating painfully fast.
- He backed off by sheer reflex and propelled himself perhaps four inches, his back
  hitting the wall with a thump.
- she snapped and pinned him to the wall with her body, manoeuvring the syringe of
  painkiller against his leg and injecting him.
- She kissed him swiftly and then pulled his uninjured arm over her shoulder, supporting
  him.
- Real and solid and impossibly there.
- he whispered.
- It felt as if the gears in his head had become uncaught.
- It made no sense.
- Her answer made no sense to him and he stared at her in confusion.
- she asked him, as she hauled him through the snow.
- How could he not have known?
- She pulled him up the last few feet, panting as she did so, and then they were bent
  double in the wind as it howled down on them.
- The blizzard made it impossible to talk now, but they had only a few feet more to
  go to reach the door.
- he thought she shouted, but her voice was whipped away by the wind.
- She pushed it in and twisted and then moved away, pulling them both back as the
  TARDIS righted itself.
- The sudden cessation of the wind was startling.
- It wasn't much warmer inside the TARDIS, but it was enough to make a significant
  difference in their chances of survival.
- He looked up from his prone position to see a robotic dog looking down at him.
- the dog asked with a slight whine.
- she told the TARDIS, giving it a pat as well.
- He was horrified as he pictured her in the Tower, planning ways to kill herself.
- Her words, combined with the regenerator, left him reeling.
- It was soft and the strands curled around his finger, just the way he remembered.
- she sighed and pulled a rather more bulky piece of equipment forward, slipping the
  stump of his wrist inside of it.
- It seemed he'd been right.
- She had her Koschei and it wasn't him.
- He had to be sure that he was treating her well, that he loved and appreciated her
  the way she deserved, the way he so desperately wanted to himself.
- she answered and he frowned, not understanding.
- In the box, his hand was starting to tingle and he tried not to think about the
  way it was being reconstructed just then, grown back from the bone out.
- Exhaustion was making him slur his words a bit as he spoke.
- she stroked his face.
- Despite the force of the crash, the cockpit was relatively intact, though one had
  to ignore the musty smell of old death and the splotches of dried blood on the walls
  to achieve any level of comfort.
- he asked gently.
- The insect had to have been the size of an asteroid, or a small moon, when this
  was shot.
- Fighters rose and fired missiles at the impenetrable silver skin, only to be brought
  down by flying insects large enough to pull them from the sky, or by swarms that
  hurled themselves into engines, flaming them out and sending the pilots to their
  deaths.
- Tanks were simply trampled, while those fighters not falling from the sky in flames
  were smashed ruthlessly aside.
- From the point where it contacted, a ball of light expanded, filling everything,
  consuming the camera in a field of brilliant white.
- She had seen the video several times, but it didn't get any easier to watch when
  it was repeated.
- He stood and walked to the back of the cockpit, looking deeply shaken.
- Adie protested.
- They smelled bad, the insects were annoying, and her boots kept getting sucked down,
  with the mud coming over the tops and squishing unpleasantly around her toes.
- she called forward and the thin, serious face turned to look back at her.
- Diana-37 shouted and they all began pelting through the mud.
- Cassidy -9 shouted.
- Zoi-29 groused and they all ran as fast as they could.
- They were always together, even when apart, but right then, she needed a bit more.
- Koschei was being patient with her clumsy attempts to follow his directions, but
  it was hard for him and she was already cross and unhappy.
- The TARDIS didn't have enough power to run a thorough analysis of the infants' TNA,
  however.
- She'd been foolish not to offload them before they'd left, but she hadn't imagined
  anything like the Manifold, or even that the Master wouldn't just come to her quickly,
  so that they could work through all of this.
- She found herself relaxing and starting to smile.
- He never wanted to wake up out of that dream, and he spent a moment with his eyes
  closed, before at last facing the fact that there was work to be done.
- He pushed himself up, before even looking to see where he was and then found himself
  standing in a strange room, feeling confused.
- She turned and the light of the medi-bay made her hair look aflame.
- He blinked hard, but she did not vanish.
- He moved towards her as if hypnotised.
- She held him just as fiercely, trying to knit up the ragged edges of his psyche.
- His mind was full of so many questions that he couldn't seem to get any of them
  to gel into actual sentences.
- she laughed and he ran his fingers through her hair.
- He couldn't think what she was doing, but allowed himself to enjoy her touch for
  a moment, before pulling away.
- His hearts were thumping so hard it was almost painful.
- She sighed and shrugged.
- she requested and reached up to kiss him lightly, but he shook his head, stepping
  back away from the kiss.
- This was proving harder than he had anticipated.
- If he succumbed to temptation now, he wouldn't have the strength required for the
  follow-through.
- he asked, blinking rapidly.
- She was happy, she had a glowing contentment about her that he had not seen before
  and he had no right to intrude on that.
- she asked, reaching out to touch his shoulder, her energy curling around him as
  she picked up his distress..
- she asked, perplexed and worried now, as he withdrew from her.
- When she finally pulled back, he was breathless and panting, confused, and filled
  with a desperate need.
- Whatever she was inclined towards wouldn't change the reactions of the rest of the
  Time Lords.
- He just couldn't bring himself to believe that after living so long in the icy darkness,
  that he would ever be able to step back into the warmth and light of her.
- He'd killed her, he forced himself to remember that, to remember that he could not
  be around her, for her own safety.
- He simply couldn't grasp so great a sea change, it was unbelievable.
- he snarked.
- But, he thought bitterly to himself, he ought to be used to that feeling by now.
- she asked softly, her arms still twined around his waist.
- he gestured around vaguely.
- She hugged him tightly, burying her face in his shirt and shivering.
- He rested his cheek on the top of her head.
- He felt so lost.
- He suddenly grabbed her and crushed her against him and she held him just as tightly.
- The scent of her was filling his lungs, making him feel dizzy and like he was drowning
  in something wonderful.
- He'd driven her mad and then killed her and for all that he was grateful to get
  this second chance, he was still nervous.
- Her expression was one he remembered from so long ago, that brilliant faith in him,
  that utter surrender that always left him shaken and wanting.
- They were defenceless against each other.
- Diana-37 asked her and Zoi-29 nodded.
- She'd built the key that had gotten Devorah-4 out of the Arena in her Loop, she'd
  created the grav-sled they had used to rescue Bresla-39 from the burning volcano,
  and she'd re-engineered most of their weapons and created a whole slew of converters
  using spare parts from a Malldoinai Freighter.
- They all knew what to do now, how to fall into pairs and search an area for any
  Masha that might be there, how to adapt to resets that came out of nowhere, and
  how to fight together as a team.
- They had ten minutes before reset, which was all they would need to rescue their
  next sister.
- She knew exactly whose fault it was.
- She looked at them all significantly.
- This was the possibility that frightened her, and her eyes searched his face, seeking
  reassurance.
- She shoved her fears away from her, determined not to fall apart again.
- The flattened disk with its bubbled under surface was dark and pitted.
- They kept discovering just enough for them to recognize that they were trapped in
  a Loop, mere moments before the reset would come and wipe that knowledge from them.
- Too late, though, to save them from the silvery wasps and beetles that descended
  upon them from the nearby glowing portal.
- The wasps stung and the beetles scratched and bit, and it made no difference at
  all.
- The Vridia took up hand weapons and prepared for boarders.
- The cruiser lasted just under forty-two.
- The locusts took the lead this time, flying to the next Möbius Barrier, and began
  to chew as space melted around them.
- She looked over at the Doctor and he reached out, slipping his hand into hers.
- She wrapped her arms around him, kissing him back, so profoundly grateful that they
  were here, alive, and together.
- Malla's memory supplied the knowledge that he was reciting an ancient poem of love
  to her and Rose smiled as she was fed the next lines.
- she asked, since Malla hadn't given her that information.
- If she looked, she imagined that she could see Susan in his centre, the pillar that
  made him stand tall, even as he supported her, and the Doctor and Rose supported
  each other.
- The Doctor kissed her on the temple, and Koschei nodded, reaching for one of the
  insulated uniforms and starting to skin into it.
- The helmets, at least, had an interior webbing which would make them fit all right
  on their heads, but her hair was too long for her to leave it hanging.
- the Doctor said with a manic grin.
- She teased and the Doctor and Koschei gave her wounded looks.
- Adie sighed, looking up at her with a doleful look, but with her eyes dancing with
  amusement.
- Rose told her with a broad grin that was every bit as manic and dangerous as her
  husband's.
- She was getting to know them very well, after all, probably more that she wanted
  to, Rose mused with a small chuckle.
- She looked up at him, her hearts beating out a joyful cadence.
- She cared about very little except getting out of the Loops.
- She had lugged paint and brushes through every miserable Loop, through snow, ice,
  jungles, swamps, and deserts, and at each rest-point, she had pulled them out and
  added new colours, new swirls, to her boots.
- Now she was teaching the illiterate Mashas to read, but mostly she was telling jokes,
  keeping everyone's spirits up and making them laugh.
- She could hear his heart beating beneath her ear and it scared her.
- She'd learned a lot in the last year and a half and one thing that she knew with
  absolute certainty, was that she didn't want to live even a day longer than Jake-77
  did.
- she asked.
- He was flushed and moving with a restless energy that startled her a bit and then
  understanding crashed over her and she just stared at him, trying to comprehend
  it all.
- The words were coming out of her mouth, but she couldn't quite believe it, even
  as she said it.
- be staying with them?
- The bitterness of that was strangling her.
- It wasn't fair to any of them for her throw a tantrum and it would make Koschei
  feel worse than he already did.
- She couldn't see him again, it would hurt too much.
- His mind was filled with Susan and the Master and the way they were making love,
  the need, the joy, it was all flowing through him and he had to fight to maintain
  his equilibrium, the intensity of it was almost too much for him.
- Adie was distressed and he had to help her.
- He leaned against the wall and slid down to the floor, sitting in a dejected heap,
  wondering if he was ever going to learn how to be a decent person.
- he teased gently and she winced a little.
- Susan and the Master were reaching a crescendo of sensation and emotion, wrapping
  themselves more tightly inside of each other and Koschei was being drawn in as well,
  his link to Susan connecting him to both of them.
- His torment ended finally, as they relaxed, curling up to sleep and he sat there,
  blushing furiously, and grateful for the insulated suit's bulk
- she suggested tentatively, blushing as well, and he closed his eyes against the
  horrible awkwardness of the situation.
- Koschei groaned, trying to figure out how to juggle all the hand-grenades he had
  in the air.
- she asked, tilting her head up to look at him in interest.
- It wasn't what he had ever wanted for her.
- Adie asked, looking at him with a steady gaze.
- Maybe if they both worked hard, for the next ten centuries or so, they could find
  a way to balance their debt to her.
- He looked at her, those hazel eyes in her heart shaped face, the thin straight nose,
  the rosebud mouth and pointed chin and he nodded, suddenly knowing who she looked
  like.
- He nodded again and found himself starting to smile.
- he asked with a wry smile.
- She smiled at him, and it was a genuine smile and it was a bit like catching a glimpse
  of the sun.
- He closed his mouth, looking a bit ashamed suddenly.
- Koschei smiled back and climbed to his feet, helping up Adie as well.
- He often wondered if the Doctor had consciously arranged that when he regenerated,
  or if he'd merely imprinted on her, taking on so much of who she was because she
  was the one person he really cared for back then.
- She bowed to him and Koschei frowned at her extreme deference.
- Koschei and Rose grinned at each other, but neither bothered to enlighten Adie,
  she'd just have to learn how to manage the Doctor on her own.
- he shouted and then they were all heading outside again.
- The blizzard was already dropping off, making visibility better and allowing them
  to talk without having to scream at each other.
- She had been puzzling over that ever since she'd spotted the Master's TARDIS on
  the scans.
- The Doctor was grinning, eyes alight, cheeks red from the cold, but radiating a
  warmth and gleeful amusement that were infectious.
- Rose asked him suddenly.
- he asked, baffled.
- Adie asked.
- he snapped back, a bit peevishly.
- Rose asked, hands on hips.
- Koschei pressed and the Doctor frowned at him.
- Rose and Koschei grinned at each other and Rose winked at Adie.
- She stared after them all, mulling this over in her head and still not understanding
  it, completely.
- Diana-37, Jake-77, and several of their sisters were working out the next mission,
  figuring out the route by which they would rescue the next few Mashas.
- As happy as she was that had been able to get through to him, she was worried about
  Koschei.
- The same war was being waged in her own hearts.
- They were both so hurt, so in need of her, and she needed them as well.
- A sudden gust of relief came over her from him.
- I was going to suggest it, but I wasn't sure...,/ he replied and she felt a wave
  of joy rush through her.
- I'm going too fast again, aren't I?/
- Wait until he wakes up and see if he's okay with it all, then we can make plans,
  okay?/ Koschei murmured to her and she nodded, her cheek rubbing against the Master's
  shoulder.
- He curled back inside of her as well, reassuring her and loving her and she fell
  back asleep, wrapped in Koschei's love and the Master's arms.
- They'd been following the Doctor's sonic for hours, the monotonous beeping guiding
  them unerringly forwards.
- Ahead of her the Doctor was waving his sonic, behind her, Koschei was helping Adie
  walk on the slippery surface.
- Adie shouted and Rose thought that that was excellent advice.
- Behind her, she heard the tinkling clatter of the insects starting to reform and
  she took off running, following the Doctor as he sprinted onwards.
- The Locusts seemed uninterested, nothing much about them was useful for conversion,
  flesh was of no use to them, and the Ants were milling about, looking for materials.
- Koschei grabbed Adie's hand and yanked her out of the way of a diving Wasp, then
  they both tumbled down a snowbank, struggled to their feet, and kept running.
- The Doctor was just ahead of her, his trainers brilliantly red against the snow.
- The Doctor turned and looked back at her, his eyes going huge and wide.
- The Doctor was shouting, but she didn't hear anything.
- Koschei and Adie turned back and he heard their shouts of dismay.
- He thought fast, though his brain felt like pudding and his legs were trembling.
- He began running as fast as he could towards the TARDIS and saw Koschei, with Adie
  hidden behind him, standing there with the sonic the Doctor had dropped, disrupting
  bugs as fast as he could.
- Adie called, darting inside.
- He carefully removed the coat, watching the bed struggling to apply patches to her,
  to try to stop the bleeding.
- Adie asked.
- He had gotten a medical degree as well, but that was in the 19th century, and he
  didn't think it would do him much good just then.
- She was out the medi-bay, running full out.
- He began frantically re-routing power, trying to bypass damaged systems.
- Koschei was working in complete silence, no energy to spare even for swearing.
- The shields were already going down under the locusts, and more were swarming at
  them every second.
- he called and ripped up a trapdoor in the floor that Adie hadn't ever seen before,
  then he dropped through it, and out of sight.
- The oscillation of the shields knocked a few off, but it wouldn't buy them much
  time.
- he shouted back, but it came from the console, not the trapdoor, there was a comm
  system somewhere.
- The TARDIS was reacting as though it were driving itself and she realized that he
  must have a secondary console in engineering somewhere.
- They weren't trapped inside the TARDIS for all eternity.
- Adie murmured.
- She gave him a deer-in-the-headlights look, blushed madly, whipped her hand behind
  her back, and left the room at once.
- In the dimness of the emergency lighting, the equipment lurked like monsters hunkered
  down, light glancing off of straps and probes that made him shudder.
- He went to his wardrobe and pressed a palm against it, flinging it open.
- His fingers stroked the fabric lightly and he went to pull it out, only to freeze.
- He shuddered at the thought of it.
- Tears in his eyes, he sealed it back up carefully and replaced it.
- He let go of some of his selfish desire to keep her all to himself and moved on
  to work on the TARDIS.
- The power had come up and the Medi-bay had gone into action, working on her with
  its full range of machinery, but she'd lost a lot of blood, had already been weak
  from the crash, and had gone into shock.
- he asked.
- she replied, her voice a bit tinny through the half destroyed wiring.
- It was an understatement, of course, but he didn't want to alarm Adie with just
  how badly damaged the TARDIS was.
- They didn't have a lot of time.
- Adie asked.
- There was a long silence.
- Naturally, now that the Master had awoken, he would take the TARDIS and that would
  be the end of it.
- But she felt like she was losing her only friend, and the bitterness of that threatened
  to break her hearts.
- Koschei was worried and working on something, but he wasn't feeling the same level
  of conflict and jealousy that he had been.
- Things were starting to look up.
- She could feel his spike of worry and upset and she moved as quickly as she could.
- he asked.
- Koschei had been broadcasting only to her, she'd thought.
- He paused, staring at her, his hands on the zipper pull, but the zipper forgotten.
- He placed her on the medical bed and Susan went to work on her.
- He wanted to say something, but there were no words left in him suddenly.
- He was shocked into silence, struggling for words.
- He had no idea.
- He put his hand on the Doctor's arm.
- He wasn't sure where the comforting words had come from, but he was unutterably
  grateful for his brain having kicked out something useful this time.
- He trailed off, looking at his wife, trembling with his fears.
- The Doctor and the Master stood nearby, the Doctor with his arms crossed and his
  shoulders hunched, looking like every moment that his wife was in pain was an agony
  for him as well.
- The Doctor put an arm around his shoulders and looked at him.
- Susan looked up at him swiftly, her eyes shadowed and he fought to close those memories
  off from her.
- Susan huffed out her breath and her hands stilled.
- She looked up and smiled at them both and the Doctor slumped in relief against the
  Master.
- Susan came over to the Master and hugged him.
- He let himself dwell on their shared history for a long moment and then shook it
  off.
- They were the five best scouts, the ones who had the best fighting skills, except
  for Diana-37, but she was the leader, so she couldn't come.
- This was no time to be reckless.
- There was a lot to repair, she'd been badly damaged in the crash and systems were
  faltering all over the ship.
- A light flashed in the darkened lab and he frowned.
- Seeing him standing over her, a small delicate hand reached up and splayed against
  the clear surface, and he put his own hand against the same spot.
- He swore and began running between them, trying to cycle them out.
- /I really need help!/
- she gasped and then dived in; taking over with two of the cycles, while Koschei
  kept working on the other three.
- he told her and dived back in.
- Koschei shouted, as he watched the second unit's status bar shade to red.
- She called back, as one of the clones in Koschei's tubes suddenly collapsed into
  unconsciousness.
- the freed Masha asked him.
- he told her, stabbing at the controls trying to get it to cycle faster.
- the Masha told him and stepped forward, grabbed the lid, and wrenched it open, like
  she was pulling open a soda can.
- The last one lay in Koschei's arms, as if she was unconscious, except her eyes were
  open.
- The two conscious ones were holding their unconscious siblings.
- She headed out and the others followed, leaving Koschei alone in the room with the
  last clone.
- He just rocked her gently, humming softly to her, hoping that he could find a way
  to fix her.
- He'd known soldiers like her before, the ones who'd been fighting for so long that
  they didn't even know why they were doing it anymore, but didn't know anything else
  either.
- She'd had her throat slit at some point and she'd healed up fast, like all the Mashas
  did, but her voice was several octaves deeper than the others now.
- She was canny and cool, Devorah, and he trusted her military judgement implicitly.
- The reset on this Loop would be around in another four hours, so the ridge was their
  best option, unless they wanted to be here when the tanks rolled through again.
- he called and they all rose and began packing.
- He missed Gallifrey, he missed Torchwood, and he missed his friends, but, as he
  looked at the Amazons, he knew he wouldn't have passed this up for the universe.
- Three days of camping, he thought to himself, not too bad.
- Blond and blue-eyed, and much shorter now, he was holding the girl with a gentleness
  that made the Master slow and stop in confusion, conflicting impulses in his head.
- Koschei was looking at him like he had sprouted another head and the Master was
  feeling vaguely ashamed about the whole thing.
- The mannerisms, the tilt of the head, it was too much himself, like looking into
  a mirror after regeneration and seeing the same expressions on a new face.
- in Koschei's arms she looked small, frail, and terribly vulnerable.
- Koschei argued, sounding exasperated..
- he protested.
- Susan would really not understand that.
- Koschei gasped and pulled out a laser screwdriver and went to work.
- Koschei's voice was strained and sad and the Master paused, the last crystal in
  his hands, feeling a sudden sense of shock.
- As for the childhood dreams, he hadn't remembered them in a very long time.
- He recalled the boy he'd been, running through the tall red grass of Gallifrey with
  the Doctor, dreaming of a better life, with an almost painful feeling of longing.
- Koschei took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
- well, after.
- What had he done?
- He worked to counter it, feeling a touch of worry for the girl that he hadn't expected.
- he asked suddenly and the Master turned and frowned at him.
- He came back carrying a cooling blanket, the sort used for fever patients and ran
  over to the sarcophagus, dropping it over the Rat, and activating it.
- Finally, she opened her eyes and looked at Koschei, just as the Master shut the
  process down.
- Her eyes were much brighter than the other clones, and when she turned her head,
  Koschei could see the jack she had installed behind her left ear.
- she asked, her eyes watchful.
- She looked surprised at the courtesy, but allowed him to help her up.
- She scowled at the Master.
- She seemed all right, but she was an inherently unstable construction and the strain
  of her personality being ripped out of her and then replaced could be problematic.
- He was still worried about them.
- The girl watched him go with a pensive expression.
- She sounded a bit defensive, as though she wasn't sure that he wouldn't laugh, so
  he made sure to smile and nod.
- Her face was bright and interested, but she looked over at where the Master was
  working and frowned.
- Koschei asked.
- The Master paused in his work and looked baffled.
- He was staring at her, like she was speaking gibberish.
- the Master nearly wailed, looking utterly flummoxed.
- He was watching her like he waiting for her to hit him, or for the other shoe to
  drop.
- he asked warily.
- They'd have to go without.
- He was looking at her like she was real, like she was a person, and that was radically
  different than the old him.
- The Master had suffered for so long, without ever receiving the sort of justice
  that she was asking of him.
- If she walked back into the stone igloo and told them the Master wasn't going to
  be held responsible for what they had gone through, she'd lose the lot of them.
- the Master asked.
- The disconnect of that was nearly painful and she grimaced.
- He said it like he was accepting his own execution and she sighed, hoping that it
  wouldn't come to that.
- /She's rather protective of us./
- How else can we save Susan?/
- Koschei asked Tomoko, trying to lower the tension in the room.
- He'd have had to be stupid not to see it, but he didn't like to speculate when no
  one had said anything to him.
- Tomoko beamed at him.
- he requested with a frown.
- The Master barked out, staring at Koschei in horror and dismay.
- the Master scowled.
- Tomoko asked.
- asked Tomoko, with an arched brow.
- She asked Koschei thoughtfully.
- Koschei's tone was bitter and he was frowning deeply.
- After all, he'd slept with the man's bonded wife, if their positions were reversed,
  there would probably be weapons involved.
- The confession came out very nearly in a whisper and Koschei snorted in bitter amusement.
- He knew what it was to hold her in his hearts, to have her Song inside of him, and
  then to have it go silent, to lose that connection that was everything to him.
- The shirt and neckties would not have been in that box with her robe, if he hadn't.
- He could all too easily imagine it, the wrenching feeling of loss and despair, and
  then the memories pouring into his mind, the promises, the bright glorious future,
  all of it snuffed out at once.
- He was falling apart, but he wrenched away from Koschei with an unhappy sound.
- He saw, from the outside, everything Susan had been saying to him.
- They stared at each other and Koschei nodded very slowly.
- Koschei asked, staring at his other self and seeing the great ragged rents in the
  fabric of his being.
- The two versions of the same man nodded at each other and went to repair the TARDIS.
- By Tomoko Construct's estimate, Moira-3 was almost two thousand years old
- The woven garments were ones she'd made on her own, having to carry the loom on
  her back to keep it from resetting every six days.
- Diana-37 had gotten them from the Shadow Architect what seemed like a really long
  time ago, one of the many goodies she'd run off with.
- The bridge to the next Loop was going to be showing up in two hours, on the other
  side of that army.
- Moira-3 though, didn't seem to grasp that he was real yet, she'd spent so long in
  the Loop, that the rest of the universe was just a dim memory to her.
- The question was starting to haunt Diana-37's dreams.
- He was feeling as though there was nothing worth doing, if she wasn't there to do
  it with him.
- He blinked and looked up and Rose, her brown eyes shining, was looking back at him.
- He started laughing.
- she told him and he jumped up.
- Typical, she thought to herself.
- Susan squatted down between the two pairs of legs and peered under the console.
- She wrapped her arms around his shoulders and kissed him back thoroughly, making
  sure he knew that she loved him completely, second version of him about or not.
- she asked, when she finally drew back.
- Koschei suggested.
- Susan felt the sharp pinch of his pain and twitched unhappily.
- His pain eased and he gave her a look filled with irony.
- Koschei pulled her closer comfortingly.
- The Master was feeling stressed and sounded like it.
- She jumped to her feet, wondering if she was going to lose him.
- /Can't you see that she's terrified!/
- I guess… I'm not very good at this./
- He stepped up to her and put his arm around her gently, kissing her a bit awkwardly
  with Koschei standing right there.
- She put both her arms around him, holding him tightly, still looking like she was
  expecting someone to carry him off at any instant.
- Susan nodded silently against the Master, but she still didn't look very happy.
- The Doctor was supporting her, one arm around her and she bundled up like an Eskimo.
- Koschei asked and she moved forward and hugged him, while the Master blinked in
  surprise.
- she asked and Koschei grinned and stepped back, turning to introduce the Master
  to her.
- He could instantly see why Theta liked her, she was brilliantly bright, filled with
  such warmth and kindness that it was hard not to just start smiling at her and she
  was looking up at him with an expression of appealing hopefulness that flummoxed
  him completely.
- The Master frowned, not liking the direction this conversation was going.
- he insisted, feeling as though he was being stripped away of everything he'd thought
  was his rather quickly.
- the Doctor protested and Koschei looked between them both rather uncertainly, as
  though not sure what side he was supposed to be on.
- the Master disagreed.
- Koschei was frowning, as was Susan, neither of them happy about this choice either.
- Miranda had called him 'Koschei', that was part of it all.
- He words forcibly reminded him of all the reasons why he thought going back to Gallifrey
  was a very bad idea and he opened his mouth to say that, when Koschei interrupted.
- Miranda had called them 'Shay' as well, obviously Koschei understood that.
- He didn't feel worthy of it.
- She was looking a bit shaky and the Master was wondering if she was really all right,
  or if the brashness was covering her weakness.
- It appeared he had been outvoted.
- He barely knew who he was, but the name Koschei had been his for so long, he wasn't
  sure he was ready to give it up.
- the Doctor called, but he could hear Koschei hushing him.
- No, Adyra was there, grease on her cheek, as she tried to repair the Dynamorphic
  generators.
- A wave of shame washed over him, followed by a sudden rush of anger at Rassilon.
- He felt like an idiot saying it, but it seemed to snap her out of her paralysis.
- She stared at him, her mouth hanging open slightly, before she shut it with a snap.
- she answered tentatively and he nodded, walking over to the other side of the magnetic
  containment systems' control panels.
- When they were finished, they parted, still in silence, and went to work on other
  things.
- he introduced himself
- he enthused.
- he grinned.
- The Doctor wrapped her up tight, still smiling.
- She smiled at that.
- There was so much data to parse and so little time.
- Tomoko-6 asked
- He looked around as though he thought she might pop up suddenly and then shrugged.
- She hunted him down in a subsection of engineering, where he was working away on
  a control panel, sitting on the floor.
- He frowned.
- he sounded surprised and she looked up at him, wondering what he was thinking.
- She sighed out, thinking about all his pain.
- she asked looking up at him in curiosity.
- he asked.
- she asked and he paused to kiss her again before nodding.
- Still, her plan had serious possibilities.
- Rose had brought in a big plate of sandwiches and then sat down in one of the chairs
  in the corner, working through some equations on a notepad on her lap.
- The Doctor looked over her shoulder at the notes.
- She looked up at him and her eyes were almost alarmingly bright, glowing hard.
- The Doctor noted the effect and chose to ignore it completely.
- Tomoko asked with narrowed eyes.
- he pointed out with a manic smile.
- Rose asked.
- She leaned forwards, creating bridges.
- Tomoko promptly recited a series of numbers.
- She was waving excitedly.
- This statement was met with general whoops and cheers.
- Every face staring into the camera was thin and dirty, but their smiles reached
  from ear to ear.
- he asked.
- Jake's beaming face took up a small corner of Diana-37's screen and he waved, his
  number visible on his dusty palm.
- he asked and the Doctor nodded.
- he groused.
- he asked.
- Jake asked with a touch of asperity.
- Everyone whooped and cheered, while the Doctor grinned.
- Tomoko-6 mused.
- Someone called back, and they all laughed.
- she scolded him and he grinned at her.
- To his disappointment, she'd gotten dressed again, but he contented himself with
  looking at her as often as he could.
- she asked, showing him her preliminary design for the retrovirus.
- she asked anxiously.
- She heard the bitterness in his voice and stroked the hair back from his brow, her
  face sad.
- She looked up at him and smiled.
- He found himself entranced by the sound, falling into her again, and she kissed
  him swiftly.
- he reminded her, feeling a twinge in his chest as he said it.
- He turned the thought around in his head and frowned thoughtfully.
- But what could he give her that the other him hadn't already?
- she grumbled.
- Rose dragged her attention back to Tomoko with an effort.
- she asked.
- Tomoko blinked in confusion and then shook her head, sticking to the topic.
- Rose asked, her nose wrinkling as she grimaced.
- Rose asked from where she was sitting Indian-style on the floor, working her way
  through some equations.
- she tried again.
- Rose protested.
- Evie had her hair in a long braid down her back, she was dressed in muted colours
  and had a hesitant air most of the time, like she wasn't quite sure where she put
  her book down.
- She was one of the youngest amongst them and also the angriest.
- She looked elegant and put-together, even in a howling wilderness.
- They seemed quiescent, but Tomoko kept an eye on them regardless.
- It was a valid question and Tomoko-6 nodded.
- Evie-44 asked, still looking uncertain.
- Neveah-72 asked and Tomoko turned to look at her.
- She didn't say anything else, she didn't have to, they all understood.
- She knew he'd keep his end of the bargain and weirdly, she trusted the Master to
  keep his end as well.
- Tomoko-6 prompted.
- One by one, they all followed.
- He was sure his other self had given them sufficient cause to hate any version of
  him and he didn't want to add to that.
- Tomoko rapped out and he looked up from his keyboard.
- he asked.
- He told her what he needed and crawled into a maintenance vent to work.
- ! 'Unfortunately, everyone else was busy, and it was no good waiting for one of
  them to be free: all of these repairs had to be done, and some of them needed this
  calibration, before they could be completed.'
- he asked, sounding like he was reading the words aloud.
- he asked.
- Not impatiently, but rather like he was nervous.
- She was being ridiculous.
- She found herself wrestling with her brain, which knew perfectly well that things
  had changed, and her gut, which was deathly afraid of what would happen if anything
  ever fell out of tolerances.
- The Doctor or someone would have known what to say here, she scolded herself.
- She'd been so bitterly lonely for so very long.
- she replied, shaking her head in mingled disbelief and amusement.
- She was remembering how he would sit and stroke her hair and had the feeling that
  she had forgotten something important.
- Tomoko was helping Koschei, while the Doctor worked on bypassing the lab's equipment,
  so they could free up the power for other systems.
- he asked.
- He never wanted to lie to her, he even hated not telling her all of the truth, but
  not all the secrets were his alone to keep and some of them were so dangerous that,
  if she knew them, others would come to strip out her brain just to get at them.
- she asked, picking up on the bit he wanted her to.
- he informed her, his mind already chewing on the problem.
- Koschei teased Tomoko, who looked at him blankly.
- Under the console, he heard Koschei groan.
- She could only see his feet sticking out from the maintenance vent he was wiggling
  into..
- Koschei had kindly unlocked it for her.
- It didn't help that spaced between the diagrams were rants and paranoid ramblings,
  either.
- his voice floated out from the vent.
- She set it down and Tomoko-6 thanked her.
- the Doctor told her with a broad smile and Evie-44 blushed a bit and left quickly
  with a smile and a shy wave at the Doctor.
- If she could get the Mashas to see the Time Lords as partners and friends, that
  would be excellent progress towards having them trust that they'd keep their word.
- The Doctor fetched tea for Rose and himself, dropping a light kiss on Rose's head
  as he set her tea beside her.
- He settled into another one of the ubiquitous black plastic chairs with a cup of
  tea and a pensive expression.
- the Doctor asked and Rose's eyes went wide suddenly as she stared at him.
- he told her, suddenly agitated, as though he was arguing with some unseen person.
- He calmed, suddenly, looking sad.
- He cocked his head at her.
- He turned and the manic energy faded.
- Rose burst out and Koschei winced.
- She chewed on her lip for a while, pacing back and forth, as the mechanics of it
  all whizzed through her mind.
- She looked away from him, rubbing the back of her neck and stripping off her jacket
  to cool herself a bit.
- Rose insisted and Tomoko shook her head.
- She smiled at Rose, but it was bit more wobbly than normal.
- Rose said with a decided air.
- Tomoko asked.
- Tomoko asked.
- She draped a cooling blanket over Tomoko's shoulders, grabbed another plastic chair
  from the lab, and turned it around, sitting in it backwards, her arms crossed over
  the back and her chin propped on her arms.
- Susan asked.
- Tomoko asked and the Doctor sighed, while Koschei looked suddenly very unhappy.
- Tomoko asked and Koschei nodded.
- She said this very calmly, but Koschei looked rather sick as she spoke.
- Susan frowned, biting the tip of her thumb as she tried to find words for experiences
  that transcended language.
- Koschei crawled out from under and began running diagnostics scans on the ship.
- Susan pointed out.
- Rose asked with a perplexed frown.
- Tomoko asked Susan and she shook her head.
- Rose asked with a roll of her eyes.
- In fact, Koschei was frowning as he watched the boards.
- he asked her.
- He waved and crawled back under the console.
- Once again she had a feeling that she was missing something.
- Koschei added.
- Rose exclaimed with wide eyes.
- Susan reminded her and Rose nodded slowly.
- Rose insisted.
- Grandfather turned and gave her a very steady, but penetrating, look and Susan shrugged.
- Rose asked and Susan tried to find words, but Koschei spoke first.
- She slipped one on, adjusting the straps, and then pushed open the door.
- A huge glowing butterfly swooped past her, the size of a dinner plate and she saw
  the electronics embedded in its wings clearly.
- That must be what Koschei had meant by 'ask the butterflies'.
- Weird.
- She called out to the butterfly.
- It also informed her that there was a blockage in one of the misters.
- For now, though, she needed to find the blockage and so headed in the direction
  indicated.
- Several though were misaligned.
- The Butterfly flashed a green light and then fluttered over to a hatch with a filigree
  handle, one of many that studded the floor.
- It clearly hadn't been turned in some time, and she had to struggle with it, but
  finally got it loose.
- There was a hasp on each connection allowing for them to be pulled out and replaced,
  or cleaned.
- It took several tries and some cursing before she finally had a solid hold on it,
  and pulled.
- It was handwritten, but by someone with excellent handwriting, or from a printing
  device that mimicked handwritten words.
- It was already dry.
- She had riffled through the TARDIS thoroughly and had pulled the best one she could
  locate, had already dismantled and reassembled it, checking for traps and bugs,
  and transferred data to it.
- She put the page to the screen and the tablet scanned automatically.
- The odds of my returning to you at all if I did, are very slim.
- I can't even bear to look at the girls sometimes, when I think about what they are
  going to be used for.
- He looks like an ice ball now, nothing left in him, I guess.
- It's creepy.
- Clones were considered citizens of Gallifrey and were members of the House of their
  creator.
- he suggested and she chuckled.
- he laughed and she could hear his shoes pounding across the flooring for a moment
  before the radio signal was cut off.
- But, seven minutes later she found that the Doctor was already there, reading a
  book and settled into one of the awful chairs..
- he called.
- he suggested.
- Then she reached in her pocket and handed the Doctor the note that she had found.
- he suggested and she smiled.
- She had found that there were data cooling rooms and a quick search through the
  TARDIS system architecture and some poking about for an hour or so had turned up
  the location of the nearest one.
- Tomoko found it strangely comforting.
- But she needed her wits about her and it felt good to be able to think through a
  problem properly.
- At some point there would have to be some sort of follow-through, but her first
  concern was to deal with the aftermath of gathering together all these traumatized
  and angry people, and the promise of a future meeting date would do that.
- They'd have to find a place to live, develop some sort of social structure...
- she asked and Tomoko looked at her in surprise.
- She pulled a heavy knit cap down over her hair, so that wisps of red framed her
  face, and the bulky clothes made her look small and somewhat fragile.
- Susan walked up to stand next to the computer, which was generating enough heat
  to make that part of the room slightly warmer.
- The very thing that she'd come to ponder here herself, the Master.
- she asked with a bird-like tilt of her head.
- Tomoko asked, surprised by the comment.
- Her aura flared dangerously and painfully bright with the sudden excess of emotion.
- Susan asked in cold clipped tones.
- Susan barked a laugh of genuine amusement.
- She said it without pride or ego, it was just a fact, like she had brown eyes.
- She was leaving footprints in her wake as the floor was covered with a delicate
  layer of frost.
- She looked distinctly unhappy though.
- Tomoko fixed her with her too-bright eyes.
- She chewed her lip thoughtfully.
- Her eyes seemed to burn especially brightly for a moment.
- She shrugged.
- He wrenched his mind back to what he was doing, not quite ready to deal with that
  revelation.
- Rose asked.
- the Doctor said with a grin.
- She looked up at him unhappily.
- she asked softly and he could sense that she was torn just then, so he smiled broadly
  and chuckled, filling his mind with warmth and confidence.
- She looked back at him, still obviously torn.
- Susan laughed and fled the TARDIS, though Guinn looked back rather mournfully.
- There were clearly figures over the nearby ridge.
- Tomoko waved, then headed out the doors.
- Koschei turned on the screen, so that the Doctor could see the horde of slavering
  monsters outside.
- Coming up the dune, waving at them.
- he suggested.
- Everyone sat down and made themselves comfortable, and Tomoko-6 spent some time
  talking about the Loops, the Manifold, the Time Lords, and the general plan to fire
  the Lens.
- He noted that Tomoko left things out and he expected that it was because the Doctor
  had asked her to be discreet.
- They started standing up, their scowls deepening.
- Tomoko was trying to shout back, but her voice was drowned out by scores of others.
- He knew what was at stake and it looked like Tomoko's education hadn't included
  motivational speaking.
- They had fought together side by side and he knew he had their respect, as they
  had his.
- He took a breath, meeting their eyes, one by one, impressing on them the seriousness
  of what he was about to say.
- he asked them and there was a stillness around him as they digested that thought.
- Tomoko looked at Jake.
- ! 'Everyone took up the fist-pump: and then they all ran, pell-mell, for the TARDIS
  they could see on the sands.'
- He shrugged.
- He leaned in and kissed her softly and grinned.
- She looked better, but still more pale than he liked to see.
- Well, when she wasn't being just as bad and egging him on.
- Rose asked, looking over at the view screen.
- Koschei replied, his tone rather dry.
- Koschei asked in confusion.
- Koschei winced at that and Rose glowered at the Doctor.
- the Doctor said.
- Jake called and Rose jumped up and tackle hugged him, grinning from ear to ear.
- she burbled to his evident surprise.
- Rose informed him and he nodded slowly.
- she hugged him.
- the Doctor said bracingly.
- She was clearly nervous to be around so many people, but she was very glad to see
  him.
- Adie was startled by how much older she looked.
- If they could see him, Koschei, as not being a threat anymore, then, maybe, they
  could make that leap to seeing Guinn that way as well.
- She had short, somewhat curly hair, was wearing overalls, and had a tool belt draped
  over her hips.
- she asked and he nodded, leading her off to the Workshop.
- he asked and she looked up at him, her face looking as though he'd offered her the
  moon, and nodded slowly.
- She looked at Zoi-29, who was hugging a laser jigsaw with a look of utter bliss
  on her face, and then over at Koschei.
- Adjusting the plumbing for a boy would be the tricky bit.
- Zoi looked at the ports and burst into happy tears again, before she hugged him
  tightly.
- she sobbed and Koschei patted her gently.
- he asked and the Doctor pointed at the screen.
- Neither of them had even noticed that Diana-37 had come to lounge in the doorway;
  now she turned and headed down the hallway, pulling her earpiece from her pocket.
- The wind was blowing through the nearby ruins, howling like a lost soul and she
  tried not to think about all the people who'd once lived there.
- They couldn't feel pain, but they were quite well aware that they could die.
- Devorah chuckled.
- Neveah had a neck or nothing attitude and Nikki was just so focused on fighting
  that she rarely paid much attention to anything else.
- Teaching a group of perpetual loners to work together had been a lot harder than
  she'd ever thought it would be.
- She pulled the trigger and the resultant explosion of silicates caused its head
  simply vanished into a fine silver mist, the rest of its body breaking up into its
  silver-dollar-sized brethren.
- Nikki protested.
- Diana snapped at her.
- The stinger went through her chest and she screamed in fury as the venom hit her
  system, then collapsed, paralysed as the Wasp sprayed out a silvery mist over her
  that quickly started to harden and encase her.
- Nikki shouted and leapt over her fallen sister, slashing at the Wasp with her swords.
- she yelled and ran with the dead weight of her paralysed sister, driving her boots
  deep into the snow.
- She stood stock still for a minute, and then began tilting her own head, back and
  forth, back and forth.
- The third girl to try and get them out was soon caught the same way.
- the Doctor snapped back.
- The three Mashas were moving again and the wasp was reeling backwards, pawing clumsily
  at its antennae.
- She was nervous at leaving Guinn alone, but she had no other choice, she had to
  help the Mashas and he certainly wasn't going to be welcome by them.
- It would have to be re-broken and straightened.
- It was hard, when they lay on the beds, like the soldiers she'd treated back then,
  but she forced a cheerful smile to her face and chattered pleasantly to them, as
  she repaired what could be repaired and reset things to heal on their own, the Masha's
  healing factor being quite as fast as Gallifreyan medicine would have been.
- It stuck to absolutely everything.
- She shook her head, biting her lip.
- He was wearing a pair of jeans and a button down shirt, which looked incongruous
  with his grease smeared face and the pile of tools and the stacks of circuit boards
  that surrounded him.
- Tomoko told him and sat down nearby.
- He took the teacup from her and sipped gratefully.
- Rose had stayed behind, under stern warning from Susan to rest, as she still wasn't
  completely healthy yet.
- They both stood there, perfectly still, until they realized that the insect was
  merely cleaning it's antennae and then it hopped away, leaving them baffled.
- Tomoko reached down and picked it up, while the Doctor whipped out his sonic and
  took a few readings.
- She could hear other metallic crickets in the area making the same noises, but none
  were within sight.
- The cricket hopped off at once, settled on the nut, and began chewing on it contentedly.
- the Doctor asked and Tomoko turned to look.
- The wasps were intent on their work, making small octagonal shapes from plastics,
  metals, whatever they could find and weld together.
- He frowned and she nodded her agreement.
- They were passive and seemingly content on building their little cells, when earlier
  that afternoon they had been determined to dismantle anything that dared to move.
- she replied.
- Tomoko nodded, not sure what else they could do.
- Tomoko asked and the Doctor crossed to look at the screen Koschei was working at.
- Koschei asked the Doctor and he frowned.
- Tomoko smiled at him.
- Koschei teased and the Doctor frowned.
- Koschei was chewing his lip meditatively.
- Koschei asked with interest.
- Rose asked.
- She glanced at Koschei with a speculative look and he smiled at her.
- The Doctor tapped the console and Guinn's face appeared on the screen a moment later.
- Her touch was magical for him and he held her tightly, just glad to be near her.
- He couldn't believe that he'd harmed them, especially when they'd been essentially
  children.
- Nobody shifted.
- His path was clear.
- He wanted to say something, to apologize, to explain, but the faces around him were
  all closed and angry and he didn't know what to say.
- He looked at the Doctor and tried to remind himself that he hadn't been abandoned.
- It was the first time that most of them had seen Guinn, in the flesh, since being
  banished to the Loops.
- Just know that we never stopped looking for you.
- There were hard times too, but we stuck together.
- And I won't spoil them now, but there will be good times too.
- And thank him for the journal too, it's lovely.
- I would tell you what I know about myself, but our lives are like shuffled decks
  of cards, some part of your future might be in my past.
- Was I taken from you?
- I wish you all hadn't left so soon, I have so many questions.
- River Song?
- Please review and let me know what you think.
- the Doctor whispered to the TARDIS, his TARDIS, as he filtered through old software,
  giving it some updates and touches that could come in handy.
- An email?'
- This was a part of the TARDIS's structure he hadn't encountered before.
- he cried, smiling as he sonic-ed it.
- can't do anything simple.'
- It was being awkward.
- It did resemble a fez, although it was perhaps a little longer than Earth-made ones,
  and it didn't have a tassel at the top - instead it had a little rubber bobble that
  bounced as you walked.
- Odd place.
- Trenzalore was the war-torn scene he'd feared it would be, meaning it was pretty
  much where he was going to fall.
- MAybe he was getting closer.
- He was almost dead in the Pandorica, he faked his death at Lake Silencio, The Silence
  wanted him dead to prevent something happening at Trenzalore, even though whatever
  happened seemed to end with his death anyway.
- Maybe tomorrow he'd get the hang of it.
- A thick, heavy red-brown stone made almost all of the moon, through to the core.
- Anyone who looks into the cave entrance feels the urge to go inside and explore,
  but once they lose the light they are lost forever.
- A little orb with a little cube inside that made equally little sense.
- Helpful.
- It was now desolate and quiet, the soft wind was warm in the light of their Sun,
  Gus, and he knew that it was unlikely he would run into anyone else.
- A space tourist, visiting the universe biggest attractions, occasionally getting
  into some rough patches.
- Often, in between, it would be markets and rides and food and celebrities.
- All eleven of them.
- place.
- It showed the fence in front of it, warding away people who are looking to be engulfed
  by this mysterious entity.
- Even here, through the picture, the Doctor felt a strong need to climb inside and
  walk until his feet bled.
- He was completely able to resist it's pull, even feeling slightly repelled by the
  thought of it taking so many lives.
- It was tiny - luminescent white and hovering in the centre of the odd orb.
- ! '''Called it.'''
- What the hell could be the purpose of that?
- Was it because he'd found it, because he took it out of the TARDIS?
- He assumed it would have the same effect if the explosion was inside as out?
- Irked.
- Just more of the wall.
- Still, he could hear shuffling, some muttering, almost at his ear but nowhere to
  be seen.
- Or, as always, there could be something new and equally terrifying as the Angels,
  somewhere down in the dark.
- Whoever was down here must have been down here a while.
- Maybe.
- There was a response, from somewhere undefinable, of a louder moan than before.
- This could be it.
- Maybe his time was now.
- He was good.
- That ego was going to be the death of him.
- The Doctor found a wall to his left, and scanned it again, started where he had
  earlier, and still found the reading was flickering.
- There were only a few things that had the strength to do that, wood included.
- Very, really very high.
- he called out, now a little more tense and cautious.
- Definitely a trap.
- ! '''Why maybe?'''
- Symbolically speaking, he was heading somewhere he wasn't going to like.
- Everything had a point, a plot pusher, an expansion and a development.
- Altogether, in the one place that gave his life as much balance as it deserved.
- The sounds he heard earlier had become more pronounced - groaning sounds, creaking
  with age.
- Living, down here, in the middle of nowhere.
- It glimmered as he approached, as though recognising him, bouncing his image around
  the sides of the blue construct, dancing with him in light.
- came the voice he had heard.
- The TARDIS went into lockdown.
- People had died here.
- Hidden and broken.
- It was a small, hunched-over boy who looked about 18, with long, matted hair and
  a small smile on his face.
- ! '''That means- Oh, no, nononono...'''
- the doctor started asking this boy.
- ! '''Keep it away from them.'''
- ! '''Can you take me out of here?'''
- A survivor?
- ! '''Are you a TimeLord?'''
- I feel it.'
- what's inside it?'
- ! '''Never open it.'''
- If you came from the Time War, then I guess that makes this dangerous.'
- ! '''I can''t remember...'''
- what's your name?'
- it hurts...'
- We need to focus on getting out of here, yeah?'
- I can work with this.'
- Every time he thought he had a feel for it, either he would change or it would.
- ! '''Screwdriver says it''s not the console that''s faulty.'''
- because I said so.'
- He fell silent, leaving the Doctor to his deductions, both about the TARDIS and
  about the boy.
- Sealed away, in a shameful corner of reality.
- What if...
- ! '''Then what?'''
- Not as good as mine, and a little bit broken, but it's still pretty damn impressive.'
- like a boat?'
- Endless black-'
- Do you want to see it?'
- A shuffle.
- ! '''Always here.'''
- the Doctor called out.
- Like shifting feet on the dirt, dragging the tiny stones built by the TARDIS matrix.
- The very core, where there's a black hole consuming a star.'
- the boy snapped, scared like hell.
- We could have a root around, see what's wrong.'
- whatever's out there?'
- I found light, I'm staying in it.'
- Orbs of crystal clarity, illuminating the rocky interior, hung from the ceiling,
  bursting with colour, casting shadow in ever corner.
- where are we?'
- Nearly.'
- What's your name?'
- I'm sure I did.'
- Tell me, where are we?'
- As long as I remember.'
- ! '''What is this?'''
- Not yet.'
- the boy asked, terrified suddenly.
- The Doctor had to grab his wrist to prevent him doing it again, even when the boy
  fought and fought against him.
- Maybe those sounds in the dark weren't the only villain around.
- Sure enough, as he pulled up the boy, he stuck to the light, never straying anywhere
  near a shadow, whether it be cast by a small passageway or just a spot where the
  light couldn't quite reach.
- Guessing, a lot, but working it all out.
- The reason this place had swallowed so many souls.
- Ahead of them, however, was perfectly clear.
- If it's faulty, then maybe it's making you see monsters where there aren't any.'
- ! '''Doctor.'''
- It knows you?!'
- ! '''We''ll find the fault.'''
- ! '''The only fault here is life, Doctor.'''
- ! '''What do you know of life.'''
- Life ending was sad.'
- ! '''I am the shadow within.'''
- Using this place as an easy way to capture prey.'
- Handyman of the Universe.'
- Such a magnificent brain of his, but only now was he clicking on.
- Away.'
- He clutched it close, like a security blanket.
- Back in the console room.'
- I could fix it, but now...'
- Scared, boy?'
- The haunting image of the pitch-black figure was approached by this paranoid, helpless
  teenager, and it was impressed.
- You took them from me.'
- ! '''You took them yourself.'''
- ! '''What do you mean?!'''
- It gave the boy a name.
- He couldn't remember being given it, or when anybody had ever used it but the shadow.
- They had a door to fix and a universe to return to.
- ! '''What am I?'''
- Perhaps not.
- Excellent.
- He had to.
- He could barely keep his lip from shaking.
- he couldn't say it again.
- Every thought he laid onto it the weight alleviated.
- Hidden from reality, stuck in this cave.
- He didn't sound like anything.
- Time Lord, like me.'
- And we just happened to stumble across each other?'
- Nothing.
- He'd found another.
- He held him tight, in the bright hall which they were supposed to be following.
- His shoulders rolled as he released Simuss and stared down the corridor, taking
  a long, deep breath and letting a smile fall across his face.
- Not yet.'
- ! '''I don''t remember.'''
- Just stupid, pathetic threats that the TARDIS is setting up against us in an attempt
  to keep us here.'
- Likely there's a damn good reason, too.'
- Simuss kept up, his legs able to take the strain of shifting dirt under each step
  and keeping up the pace for whatever distance he had to until the Doctor stopped,
  paused, and thought.
- how long had he spent in the darkness, feeling the shadows shifting around him,
  hearing lonely souls wander into the pitch black caves and fall to hunger, thirst,
  loneliness.
- And Simuss had changed that.
- Would he go even further, and try to figure out why the TARDIS was trying to hold
  them in, and then had suddenly given them a clear track back to where they wanted
  to be?
- ! '''Why did the shadow give us a way back?'''
- Stupid, stupid stupid.
- Nothing.
- No panic, no suspicion, no off-feeling that you get in your stomach when something
  happens but your brain hasn't quite figured out what it is yet.
- Simuss had that feeling at the exact moment he thought about what having that feeling
  meant.
- It was all a trap.
- in an odd, sort-of gurgling voice.
- Simuss just stared at him.
- And I've been working on it for-'
- ! '''This is an issue.'''
- He had spent so long hiding from the shadows.
- He damned himself for not keeping a closer eye on where the lights were exactly
  - he couldn't even remember if they were definitely above them.
- Simuss called for him, sounding as though he had shrunk to the floor.
- He didn't want to lose this boy - not after the amount of people who had been lost
  down here.
- ! '''Simuss, do you know what this man is?'''
- ! '''He''s the Doctor.'''
- Am I right, Doctor?'
- That must mean something.
- the Doctor said out loud, not really expecting Simuss to answer.
- ! '''They twisted me into giving them a snippet of information I shouldn''t have.'''
- Why give us a way back here?'
- I don't know.'
- I'm freaking out.'
- How would he react?
- To give them their identity and their solitude back-to-back.
- A Time War.'
- He had to.
- Maybe he'd have the strength.
- he asked, innocently.
- ! '''I ended the whole thing.'''
- Well, a woman named River is kind-of Time lord, but that's about it.'
- And that's good, I suppose.'
- ! '''Surely that counts for something?'''
- But sometimes I feel like I'm just making things worse.'
- I was alone, and no there's you.'
- ! '''Now, let''s get to that console room.'''
- They followed the tunnel until the rocky surface seemed to start to merge with metal
  - the two solid materials twisted and twined on the ceiling and down the walls as
  they approached the crystal pillar in the console room.
- The shivers and twitches of shifting darkness that made no sense whatsoever.
- He simply scanned the cave entrance that he had first came through, looking for
  any signs of it being a doorway.
- Observing.'
- Very rude.'
- Within these caves, we might as well be dead.'
- In all it's faults.'
- ! '''Are you trying to talk us into releasing you?'''
- ! '''You make me sound like an animal.'''
- A killer.'
- Simuss yelled, getting angry again.
- Perhaps they were killers.
- ! '''Then, and only then, do we discuss you getting-'''
- What is in this box?'
- His eyes were wide and accusing, searching for some twist, some sign from the shadows.
- He held.
- What you did-'
- You.'
- ! '''How do you know the Doctor''s name?'''
- We knew you upon sight regardless of your changing face.'
- Simuss ordered.
- It needs to know what will happen when the TARDIS attacks those who wander into
  it.'
- ! '''We only know it is not ready yet.'''
- the Doctor asked.
- ! '''What is third?'''
- It manipulated this TARDIS to act on it's behalf, taking wanderers and changing
  them.'
- the doctor asked.
- They seem to be drawn to this place.'
- Anyway, if you are it's eyes, what have you seen?'
- More wary of what the answer could be.
- A new fear in them, we could feel it, but we never did anything.'
- ! '''Is it possible?'''
- What am I doing here?!'
- ! '''You are human, but you are not.'''
- It rewrites your biology, alters every cell, your basic, fundamental physiology
  changes.'
- he asked, looking at the Doctor.
- what?'
- the shadows asked.
- Where did they go, once they had changed in Time Lords what happened?!'
- They wandered into the dark, after cowering.'
- No law of physics would allow it.'
- ! '''You were human.'''
- ! '''Is there anywhere that their human spirits could have been locked in?'''
- Simuss offered.
- No there won't.'
- YOur life, Simuss.'
- I can't trap it, that would mean trapping the human spirits.'
- This is a huge plot, a plan that doesn't make any sense to me.'
- It didn't choose to get in, but it can force me to spring the lock.'
- the shadows asked.
- He was trying to come up with a suggestion, any suggestion, that might save people
  without letting out whatever did this to them.
- All of that, everything people go through, do you want it back?'
- It beat you, and now it's going to get out by beating you again.'
- You seem to have done rather well so far, can we get out?'
- He was more interested in the box.
- Nothing.'
- Didn't want it getting out.'
- The more we know, the stronger we are.'
- ! '''But we''re not clueless.'''
- the shadows asked.
- The box is watching us through you, shadows, and yet you're using 'we'?'
- ! '''It just might shock you what''s best.'''
- Simuss asked, not taking his eyes off the shadows.
- The people, lost down there.'
- They'd be fine for weeks.'
- Years, even.'
- I suppose people assumed it was always here.'
- ! '''Did you see that, box?'''
- Slowly, but surely.'
- It's a message.'
- That sounds like a decision, not a question.'
- There was a small latch on the front, with a lime-green gem, round and soft encrusted
  inside.
- Looking for their own bodies.
- It filled him.
- Dirty and old.
- Swallowing it.
- It lunged at the Doctor, screamed at him, and then shrouded him in it's fog.
- He waited for his squinting eyes to adjust before even attempting to look around,
  but he instantly saw Simuss, on the ground next to him, bathing in light.
- He couldn't really remember taking it off.
- Something knew him, and he had set it free.
- This stupid moon was bloody hot and he was sick of it already.
- Time Lord to Human.
- He hoped it was trust.
- Everyone else was wearing some kind of gear, be it a cave-diving jumpsuit, a sliver
  over-all with navy blue or a slightly confusing fishnet-esque body-covering suit.
- ! '''Do we know where we are?'''
- said a man, maybe in his forties with a large beard that masked most of his face.
- ! '''Gug, a little desert moon with, anyone?'''
- What happened?'
- It gets a little complicated.'
- ! '''A box with something inside.'''
- Untraceable, and locked within it was something that changed all of you.'
- came a voice.'
- came another.
- Releasing whatever was inside.'
- Nought but sand and rock.
- A spaceship, called a TARDIS.'
- asked a random crowdling.
- ! '''The thing in the box used it to draw you in, transform you, store your memories
  in the box so that I had to let it out to let them out and save you, returning you
  to Humanity.'''
- asked someone.
- I know.'
- asked the teenage girl.
- Then, we're going to track the green figure all across the Universe.'
- Simuss whispered, seemingly agreeing to the proposal.
- You can set down, have a cuppa, go back to your lives.'
- They were waiting for me in the town, would they still be here?'
- You direct us then, sir.'
- ! '''You say the town is that way?'''
- The Doctor watched Harper walk past his little bolder and hopped off, following
  him to the town.
- That wasn't right...
- ! '''Everyone''s gone!'''
- came a voice.
- Great.
- A slap.
- Oh for the love of- EVERYONE, SHUT UP!'
- The plan...'
- A couple of mutters.
- She's very good, and she'll be able to help me help you.'
- asked someone.
- thoughtful.'
- ! '''My family is gone and you''re worried about getting too thoughtful?'''
- We need to find them, okay?'
- How wonderful it must feel to just expect people to be around like that.
- ! '''I''ll be back soon.'''
- I saw someone should go with you, make sure you come back and help us.'
- ! '''I''m the Doctor.'''
- Harper?'
- I shouldn't be long!'
- Almost, because he knew he would be back soon, and he'd have to deal with them.
- what was your name?'
- Track down strange mysteries, solve them, save people.'
- That made him sad.
- ! '''Why would they?'''
- Could this be to do with the green figure?
- ! '''What would tell them to, your box-ghost.'''
- Not yet, anyway.'
- A new discovery.'
- ! '''You''re starting to enjoy it.'''
- Why do you still help people if you know it's just going to twist you to the point
  where you enjoy it, even.'
- For good.'
- ! '''Here we are!'''
- ! '''It''s not even a pretty box.'''
- He realised what he'd said, his eye widening, but to his mercy Harper didn't respond.
- Much more impressive, I think you'll find.'
- The Doctor grimaced.
- ! '''It''s...'''
- I'm guessing the door is a dimensional transference device?'
- To Earth!'
- That place has burned!'
- ! '''Off we pop!'''
- the Doctor yelled, laughing maniacally as they span towards Earth - 2013.
- The Doctor left Harper to recuperate and, by the time he was off the grey floor,
  the Doctor was back inside with a girl who looked like she'd been waiting for this
  for too long.
- ! '''Now then, we have to find out what''s happening with this green figure.'''
- Clara asked.
- You back in, or do you need more time?'
- This was hell.
- She'd watched a version of herself be shot and killed, and her lover walk her into
  the edge of reality itself, so she was due a holiday.
- And a crying boy.
- he cried.
- My family's gone missing, my child is gone and you swan off in your box to collect
  your friend?!'
- Didn't deviate for a second.'
- Clara asked, pointing at the crying boy.
- Hey-ho!'
- He smiled.
- he asked.
- Clara asked him, quietly.
- Where do you think your wife is, Harper?'
- I thought I was just a funny man in a bow tie, right?'
- What are your thoughts?'
- Why?'
- ! '''So it could get out.'''
- what was it called?'
- This is no longer a exploration, Simuss, it's a rescue mission.'
- we need to find the green figure.'
- Called it.'
- ! '''You called me in, what do you need?'''
- I need you to help these lovely people.'
- ! '''I''m going to have to chase down this TARDIS-wielding rogue, I need someone
  to look after them.'''
- She'd missed this.
- If you stay here, I'll bring them back here.'
- Harper asked, looking around at the scorched town.
- ! '''And wait.'''
- Harper yelled.
- But I have to ask - if I told you that there was literally no one better suited
  to finding everybody who's gone missing in this town than me, would you trust them
  in my hands?'
- ! '''It seems to me that they''re not in your hands, are they?'''
- ! '''Simuss, you coming?'''
- ! '''They were annoying me.'''
- Clara smiled.
- Where ever it's gone, it's likely that the people who've gone missing are there,
  too.'
- Simuss asked, holding a rail, nervous.
- We can maybe find it's next landing place, if we're lucky...'
- ! '''There is pretty much infinite space and time, it could have gone anywhere.'''
- ! '''Home.'''
- ! '''Except, we don''t know where it''s home is.'''
- how does that help us?'
- ! '''Shouldn''t take too long.'''
- Simuss asked.
- ! '''Like, a Time lord.'''
- Simuss chimed.
- ! '''They seem to be fairly temperamental, plus one has been ''humanised'' before,
  right?'''
- Clara asked.
- ! '''We know where it''s gone.'''
- Clara and Simuss both asked, equally dumbfounded expressions on their faces.
- he said, grinning.
- Bigger on the inside.'
- ! '''We''re inside a TARDIS, inside a TARDIS?'''
- A TARDIS that dematerialised, massively expanded, and then rematerialised, swallowing
  Gug!'
- Simuss asked.
- It's holding Gug ransom!'
- So, we've been capture again,' Simuss deduced, deflating.
- Alternatively, we try to get the mouth of the TARDIS to open up so we can squeeze
  Gug out along with it's inhabitants, but that might be tricky.'
- Clara asked, getting seriously confused.
- We'd have to program it to be huge, let out the whole moon.'
- Simuss asked.
- And that's because it is.'
- ! '''If we''re going to have any chance figuring out what this thing is, or what
  it wants, then we''d better start by getting out of this room.'''
- Clara bit her lip.
- We need to get out.'
- But only if it's damaged, usually it just sits there...'
- Simuss stopped him, thinking.
- ! '''You know, growing!'''
- It's fairly rare, but there you go.'
- Shrink the TARDIS down.'
- Clara asked.
- Come one, English, first day of class, Protagonists and Antagonists, what's the
  main thing?'
- An Antagonist in the tale thinks it's the Protagonist of it's own story, and every
  Protagonist worth it's weight changes through the story.'
- evil.'
- Clara asked.
- Hopefully we can appeal to the good in it.'
- What if it just wants to kill everyone on this moon, and taking it hostage was just
  an easy option?'
- He did a lot of that.
- We'll see.'
- No expansion, so it'll be easy to get out of once we find the exit.'
- I can't find the exit.'
- I'll look into it later.'
- ! '''Are we really in a place to ignore a coincidence?'''
- We need out.'
- We're here!'
- Wonder what it's going to look like.'
- ! '''Will it still be that?'''
- It seemed to go on forever.
- Lights and shimmers looked up at them, blank against the white and shining pillar
  that dances in the middle, completely still.
- ! '''It''s the console room.'''
- There weren't any buttons or levers or anything that looked close to being used
  to control a spaceship.
- Simuss asked.
- On the white.'
- Smooth.'
- He smiled.
- ! '''It''s beautiful.'''
- Clara, enjoying the sparkling yet clear orb of a room that collected in the tall,
  spheric tower in front of them, moved to the Doctor's side, understanding that they
  had to release Gug from the heart of this TARDIS.
- It was soundless.
- He was grinning like a child at Disneyland.
- And, oddly, cold.
- Clara called back.
- ! '''Oh you naughty girl.'''
- Clara asked, offended.
- he nodded to the TARDIS while he kept on working.
- What did you do, girl?'
- ! '''Flirting with another TARDIS!'''
- ! '''Do they do that?'''
- ! '''I''m guessing you''re on her side?'''
- Besides, dad, you should be happy.'
- Getting back out there.'
- They ignored him.
- Then she turned to Simuss, and saw him pointing.
- Simuss called again, and now the Doctor turned his head.
- Especially in this form.'
- ! '''Have we met before?'''
- ! '''Don''t you see?'''
- Then it thought and said, 'I suppose, yes.'
- I'm old, you know.'
- from the first day I met you, all those years ago, back on Gallifrey, I've known
  exactly what you were.'
- I do have a TARDIS.'
- The Master?'
- Though he does have a part to play, if everything goes right.'
- I love people like you.'
- ! '''I''m going to take over the Universe'', or ''kill the Doctor'', or whatever
  evil plan you''ve got going.'''
- A guessing-game?'
- Exercise that big, old brain of yours.'
- Tell me what's going on.'
- I'm assuming you saw those readings coming from Gug?'
- First, I just want to see if it's possible.'
- Clara asked eventually.
- ! '''Gug back home.'''
- ! '''Doctor,'' she said.'
- he called back, his voice void of emotion.
- Clara nodded.
- she asked the Doctor, turning to him.
- I'm always fine.'
- I know when you say that, what you really mean.'
- My problem.'
- The Time Lord Supreme.'
- You are my hero.'
- You're my friend.'
- A fighter.'
- And now there's another.'
- Some are bad.'
- Is someone who tries to justify everything they've done and fails everyday a good
  man?'
- A man who will go to any length he can to save the families of a stranger who sees
  him as nothing but a threat.'
- It's going to be torture.'
- Clara asked.
- ! '''What are they?'''
- what?'
- there's two.'
- Seeing as we can notice it now, I'm guessing that that's where the green guy went.'
- That's it.'
- I kept having memory-loss.'
- What it might do.'
- Simuss asked.
- Clara and Simuss followed, taking one last look at Gug outside, floating in front
  of them, happily plodding along.
- If this thing could create Time Lords, invincible creatures with changing faces
  and two hearts, she wondered what else it could make.
- In many ways, he was more human than he thought.
- He seemed to appreciate it.
- She had an inkling that he didn't want to - not really.
- ! '''You''re okay?'''
- They were all lying.
- He had a million questions and a mission which would most likely make sure none
  of them were answered.
- It was hollowed-out-moon big.
- It disguised itself as a moon, and people just forgot about it.'
- A million years, trapped inside a box.'
- ! '''Come on.'''
- She wondered if the artificial gravity would keep them locked to the side no matter
  where they went, or if it would soon start to feel like walking up a hill, up the
  curve.
- ! '''How many more?'''
- Simuss asked.
- Clara asked.
- No.
- New schools.
- That must be it.
- For everything you've been through.'
- He couldn't stop.
- Clara asked, but they both ignored her.
- Get out.'
- ! '''Nothing got out.'''
- ! '''The Emperor got out.'''
- I was there.'
- What happened?'
- His time was passed.'
- Then another, which crashed into this one-'
- I'm sorry Grandfather.'
- he asked.
- And you had a team of how many?'
- As far as I know, six of us got through.'
- I had to make sure everyone else got through.'
- So very, very proud of you.'
- I don't know what happened to the other six, but something is here.'
- What do they want?'
- My Grandfather, the hero of Gallifrey.'
- Keep him safe.
- A green glow filled the room.
- What did you do?'
- His eyes were wide and accusing, searching for some twist, some sign from the shadows.
- He held.
- What you did-'
- You.'
- ! '''How do you know the Doctor''s name?'''
- We knew you upon sight regardless of your changing face.'
- Simuss ordered.
- It needs to know what will happen when the TARDIS attacks those who wander into
  it.'
- ! '''We only know it is not ready yet.'''
- the Doctor asked.
- ! '''What is third?'''
- It manipulated this TARDIS to act on it's behalf, taking wanderers and changing
  them.'
- the doctor asked.
- They seem to be drawn to this place.'
- Anyway, if you are it's eyes, what have you seen?'
- More wary of what the answer could be.
- A new fear in them, we could feel it, but we never did anything.'
- ! '''Is it possible?'''
- What am I doing here?!'
- ! '''You are human, but you are not.'''
- It rewrites your biology, alters every cell, your basic, fundamental physiology
  changes.'
- he asked, looking at the Doctor.
- what?'
- the shadows asked.
- Where did they go, once they had changed in Time Lords what happened?!'
- They wandered into the dark, after cowering.'
- No law of physics would allow it.'
- ! '''You were human.'''
- ! '''Is there anywhere that their human spirits could have been locked in?'''
- Simuss offered.
- No there won't.'
- YOur life, Simuss.'
- I can't trap it, that would mean trapping the human spirits.'
- This is a huge plot, a plan that doesn't make any sense to me.'
- It didn't choose to get in, but it can force me to spring the lock.'
- the shadows asked.
- ! '''But there''s two hundred.'''
- ! '''He bloody well did it again.'''
- He's making you let him go again.'
- There's two hundred and thirty six perfectly human people in there, and one who
  we still need to take care of even if they are possessed by a Time-Lord with PTSD.'
- Alone, in a destroyed TARDIS, your body broken like that.'
- Susan, I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you're like some kind of psycho-link with
  me, picking out a person from my past I like to talk to me and retailing details
  as though you were her?'
- I can't...'
- Who put him in that box after he started to regenerate?'
- ! '''There''s one thing Time-Lords aren''t very good at doing, in my experience.'''
- Simuss asked.
- ! '''First thing we need to do is get all of those people unplugged, the we''ll
  take them up to the surface.'''
- ! '''The people up there, they''ll be able to tell which one''s faking, right?'''
- Tenderly poking the snake, he tugged at a small bump maybe an inch down from where
  it connected to her head.
- the Doctor nodded and felt her hands, much more real than a projection on his head,
  as she swept him away into the past.
- Slender but tough.
- ! '''I''m regenerating.'''
- ! '''Carlteqsue, you have to stop.'''
- We can roam the Universe as it is, without destroying anything!'
- Here, that would unlock the Time War.'
- Do you know why it was hell, Master?'
- We can go about our business as usual.'
- The Master took a deep breath and lifted the box, opening it wide and sucking in
  Carl's green regeneration energy, swirling and screaming until it was snapped shut,
  cutting the scene short.
- Carl was planning on opening up the hole in the Time War that would, for whatever
  reason, save the Universe.'
- We can do this!'
- One-by-one, the Doctor, Clara, Simuss and Susan's projected ghost ushered the two-hundred
  people into the Doctor's TARDIS.
- Look for traces.
- It was sneaky and mean, but it worked.
- He had to let him go.
- ! '''You waited up.'''
- I know you have to-'
- Then you know what you're doing and I don't have to brief you.'
- Keep the Time War locked away, where it belongs.'
- okay.'
- I know I'm not-'
- ! '''There we go.'''
- his Granddaughter asked.
- He'd missed that from her.
- Made it so.'
- She held a small circular device with a single red button on which was linked to
  her chestplate, an armoured, scaled piece of clothing with wiring casing the seams
  and technology sewn into the metallic fabric.
- Just don't die like last time, and you'll be fine.'
- Real nice.'
- Why did you have to use all of your lives again?'
- I really do.'
- A figure of a Sycorax female shot up from the blue line and she pressed the button.
- Brilliant!
- He was curious.
- She smiled.
- I got it working!'
- ! '''You built the damn thing to begin with.'''
- ! '''Lussi, you wanna go hunting?'''
- We have a ship.'
- unless-'
- It works!'
- You'd need to get up-close and personal with the squidgy stuff inside.'
- But I'm still in charge.'
- Apart from all the dying and stuff.'
- We left it.'
- ! '''We got away!'''
- She'd go into her own world that had it's own rules and laws and she lived by those
  ones.
- ! '''Revert.'''
- She smiled.
- ! '''Now, where''s your list?'''
- Where is it?'
- On the left was the curtain that lead outside, into the market.
- They had plenty, but it wasn't how much you had - it was the quality of your stock.
- Kind of.
- He never brought it up.
- Expensive things.
- That was her world.
- In any case, she likes to find new species, take a sample of DNA, and build her
  collection of possible creatures to become.
- Jaymse asked her.
- Lussi, you're not doing that!'
- She took a breath, 'Can we go find a new one?'
- Like the Doctor!'
- That man is no role model, I'll tell you that.'
- hopeful.'
- It was good, for a while.'
- ! '''Could we?'''
- It never registered with them where the change was, from pushing the curtain aside
  to turning a doorknob, but it just happened.
- No one cared yet.
- he asked her.
- Someone new!'
- You bring a book?'
- I'm going to play with being a Judoon.'
- Isn't it illegal to impersonate a member of the Shadow Proclamation, Lu?'
- That was my whole point.'
- What's your job now?'
- When we had the TARDIS, it was ever, but now, it's just whatever we can find.'
- What you have to.'
- It's a big place.'
- Bring lots of life into people.'
- ! '''I hope we see a creature we''ve never met before.'''
- Jaymse didn't like the name, but it was memorable, if nothing else.
- He wasn't sure how much she'd remember of it.
- Perfect pickings.
- It was almost always her turn.
- Beautiful.
- Hard to get near and to touch, never mind get a sample - mind you, that was most
  of the fun of it.
- The psychology of each species.
- It was all very philosophical.
- Lussi beamed as they descended down into a sea-side port that was only just able
  to keep The Horseman from dipping into the scarlet water.
- Good turn-out.
- His ears twitched, as though noticing that they were staring at him and his stool,
  and Jaymse quickly turned to ask Lussi, 'Have you got that species?'
- she clicked the button on her pad, though for a second before saying tentatively
  'Plothrite!'
- Which, right now, I suppose I am.'
- ! '''But I need something from you, Jaymse.'''
- I want it, and you need to get it.'
- ! '''You have to kidding me.'''
- His shoes dipped into the sand as he took slow step towards the Ylgrit'pl.
- It had, however, been a while since the two of them had taken a holiday, never mind
  to somewhere like Roxmanop.
- ! '''Jaymse, Human, Male.'''
- Male.'
- Easy.
- Hi's mouth seemed to bubble from underneath the mess.
- If he had eyebrows, Jaymse imagined they would be raised.
- It's customary, back on Earth.'
- ! '''You don''t smell like Earth.'''
- I've actually got a stall on the Market, over on Lihoh.'
- Thieves, the lot of you.'
- He took a flask from the inside pocket of his waistcoat and scraped it against Hawll's
  back.
- Hawll cried out, trying to shuffle round to see him, but Jaymse took off running,
  slowly feeling the seaside air push back into his nostrils, replacing the thick
  stench of Ylgrit'pl sweat.
- Now go get me my stool.'
- He glanced over to where the male Plothrite had been, but he was gone.
- Jaymse asked.
- I don't care.'
- I made it quite clear.'
- ! '''We might make a little thief of you yet.'''
- Or your new friend.'
- ! '''Ha!'''
- The Horseman climbed into the air, forcing Hawll to stay far enough away for them
  to laugh at him out of the window.
- Gagging was a reflex that wouldn't stay restricted.
- It was haunting.
- He didn't need it - or at least, he wouldn't, if he'd used his 'gift'.
- Not now he'd seen him.
- Jaymse had taken care of it, and he'd felt great for a week afterwards.
- Maybe he'd find out about it.
- Or he'd seen Lussi steal the stool, and was trying to chase her down.
- He knew he would.
- Away from preying eyes.
- They got out.
- She'd hate him if she did.
- He just makes his way with strength of will and adrenaline, plus the reapings of
  his nightly wanders.
- Stalls were bare, tents like his set up behind them, full of future sales and stock.
- It'd be nice to get his energy back quickly after a day like today.
- He took light steps and lighter breaths, pausing to listen for any commotion within.
- A sofa upon which there was a snoring lump of a man, whose night was about to be
  ruined.
- Something with too many vowels.
- It was easy pickings, if he could bring himself to take them.
- It was a really bad idea.
- Both helpless.
- She was brilliant ad fiesty when she wanted to be, but she'd forget to eat if he
  didn't remind her to.
- It felt like it was hiding something from him.
- He didn't even know why he was trying to, it was massively incriminating.
- He was snoring.
- ! '''I need to.'''
- It was always his fault, and Lussi didn't know a thing.
- On the floor of some stranger's tent.
- They'd assume Lussi had something to do with it, too.
- She wants to live so so much, and he was stealing that.
- ! '''I''m sorry, my friend,'' he said before allowing the energy to flow.'
- Lussi.
- He panicked.
- Lussi held his hand.
- Where did the daughter go?
- The husk of his skin, holding no life.
- Had Lussi really left?
- He'd dreamt her leaving.
- Now he might get noticed.
- Would it affect him?
- Full of it.
- He had to take care of her, keep her safe and secure and playing with her technology.
- ! '''I''m sorry Jaymse!'''
- what?'
- Don't take it away, please!'
- You're okay?'
- what?'
- ! '''You know I love you, like you were my little sister.'''
- I think we're going to have to leave again.'
- No!'
- You said at least one more market day!'
- I have friends.'
- I could have friends.'
- ! '''I don''t think I do...'''
- What's your earliest memory?'
- Your face was different, but then you exploded and turned into you!'
- Do you remember the Doctor?'
- he left.'
- what is that?'
- Her eyes were fixed on him, her hands shaking as she sat, shrouded in darkness,
  her silhouette trembling.
- ! '''I do...'''
- it's in a bubble.'
- And there's a temple inside...'
- You remember!'
- The Horsemen.'
- What are we talking about?'
- Yeah.'
- Do you remember, Lussi?'
- no.'
- I think he's coming back.'
- Do you remember what they called us, Lussi?'
- Slightly misogynistic, but whatever.'
- Do you know what they were?'
- And you were?'
- ! '''Pestilence.'''
- he was War.'
- Why I want us to leave in his wake?'
- I stopped aging during that year, without any explanation why.
- I'd seen family and friends die, over and over again, and each time I wanted it
  to be me.
- One day, I will find out.
- Will be posted on Wattpad too.
- right then, allons-y!
- Joyce asked Olivia as she sat at the table, Olivia's mother at the sink, washing
  some dishes.
- Olivia smirked, lifting her plate and taking it to the sink to help Joyce with the
  dishes.
- he asked.
- Joyce wondered, finishing with the dishes as Olivia rummaged through a drawer for
  scissors and a letter opener.
- But what caught her attention was the color…TARDIS blue, and there was a number
  at the lip of the seal of the envelope.
- Joyce wondered as Olivia used the letter opener on it.
- Joyce frowned as Olivia flipped her Sonic in the air before catching it perfectly.
- Joyce wondered.
- She turned to thank the bus driver before he drove away and as the bus cleared her,
  her eyes locking with a pair of green eyes staring at her from under a wide-brimmed
  Stetson.
- the Doctor smirked in a Southern accent, standing next to a red and white station
  wagon.
- she smiled, wrapping her arms around his neck to lean into him as his arms wrapped
  around her waist to pull her closer.
- It was so potent she had to break the kiss to look him in the eye.
- she questioned, still frowning and his own frown of confusion fell away.
- she frowned.
- Olivia smiled, hugging Rory as Amy hugged Amy.
- Amy grinned at the Doctor.
- the Doctor grinned back, making Olivia frown.
- Amy replied.
- the Doctor grinned, hugging him as Olivia hugged Amy.
- Olivia grinned, running toward her and hugging her tightly.
- River grinned, as Amy and Rory slid into the booth with them with drinks.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy asked.
- they all cheered, clinking their glasses of wine, the Doctor holding the bottle.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy wondered as they all sipped at theirs.
- she chirped, making him frown at her from his reclined position.
- Amy muttered.
- Rory wondered and when she looked at him she shook her head, taking a sip of her
  wine.
- she wondered.
- Olivia prompted.
- Her grip tightened on his hands as she found their telepathic bond.
- The Doctor gently nudged Olivia to stand, which she did, along with everyone else,
  and he waved to an old man that now stood outside the van and waved back.
- Amy questioned the Doctor.
- Olivia trailed off as they all stared at the astronaut standing in the knee deep
  water at the shoreline of the lake.
- Amy whispered as the astronaut's hand came up.
- Olivia shouted as she and Amy both tried to run to him but River held Olivia back,
  Rory stopping Amy.
- River reminded them both just as another shot rang out and the Time Lord stumbled
  back again.
- Olivia screamed, struggling to be free.
- Olivia screamed, all four of them launching into a run toward him as the astronaut
  walked away, back into the lake.
- River holstered her handheld as she stood and pulled out her gun to fire at the
  retreating astronaut until her gun was empty.
- Rory asked.
- Amy sobbed as Olivia lowered her head over the Doctor's to sob as well.
- Rory instantly wrapped his arms around Olivia's waist, pinning her arms to her sides
  as he held her back.
- he reminded her, struggling against Olivia as she fought to break free.
- Olivia spat.
- He was gone, and it was tearing her up inside.
- Olivia asked in a raw voice, not looking away from the burning boat.
- River and Olivia glanced at each other before pulling their similar envelopes from
  their pockets.
- Rory asked in wonder.
- Rory wondered as they walked into the diner.
- River wondered.
- Rory wondered.
- Olivia called, staring at the blue envelope on one of the tables and she ran toward
  it to pick it up to examine it and Rory went to the server behind the counter.
- he asked.
- The Doctor looked up and grinned, chewing on a straw, and pointed to all of them
  in greeting.
- Amy murmured.
- he guessed, looking to her shocked and enraged expression.
- She was just staring at him in confused shock, making him frown down at her.
- When they pulled away with a smack she still said nothing as her arms wrapped around
  his chest to hug him, burying her face in his chest, refusing to let him go.
- he wondered.
- Amy questioned.
- the Doctor smiled, intrigued by the name.
- he asked her but she only gave a knowing, sad smile before replying with one word.
- enjoy!
- It made her stomach lurch as the image played again in her head.
- he asked with a frown, making her swallow and look to his bowtie in thought.
- River hugged her in return, knowing Olivia had sensed her pain.
- the Doctor asked.
- he asked.
- Rory questioned just before the entire room filled with bright light.
- the Doctor questioned her.
- he called under the strain of being pinned.
- Nixon questioned.
- Nixon questioned again.
- the Doctor replied incredulously as he lowered his hands.
- Nixon asked again.
- Canton asked.
- the agent snapped.
- Canton asked the Doctor.
- she asked, making him look up at her, his eyes lighting up.
- he grinned, making her lean forward and press a kiss to his forehead.
- Canton asked.
- Rory asked, he and Olivia stepped closer out of concern.
- River called in concern as well.
- the Doctor asked, crossing the room with a map in his hands.
- She gasped and took a step back, stumbling into Amy who also gasped as they both
  stared at the tall, alien figure in a black suit at the other end of the hall in
  horror.
- Olivia demanded.
- Olivia snapped, making the woman turn back to them and when she blinked, she frowned
  again.
- she asked, making both girls frown in return at her.
- Amy pleaded when the woman took a step closer then turned back to her and Olivia.
- The sound continued until the blonde woman disintegrated, and the lights returned
  back to normal, leaving Amy shuddering behind Olivia who only glared at the thing.
- Olivia demanded as Amy took a picture of it before snapping her phone shut.
- Amy questioned.
- Amy shuddered.
- Olivia called, rushing after her, both panting when they reached the hall outside.
- the agent waiting for them asked, seeing them looking distressed before they both
  looked up at him.
- he asked, looking to Amy's hand and Olivia's eyes widened in panic.
- he asked.
- the agent asked her as Olivia frowned at her in wonder and she frowned in return
  between them.
- But they'd all agreed not to say anything to him about what they'd seen in Utah…so
  what did Amy have to tell him?
- enjoy!
- Canton guessed who was calling.
- Nixon wondered.
- Canton demanded, running after her and shutting the door behind him.
- Amy wondered.
- he asked him before sailing past him, grabbing Olivia's hand on the way as River
  switched on her handheld and followed them, Amy right after them.
- Rory wondered, irritably.
- Olivia wondered as the Doctor lifted a flag from a desk in the office they'd landed
  in and waved it as he spoke.
- Amy wondered, flashing a flashlight around the dark room as River scanned around
  with her handheld.
- she wondered, making Olivia frown at her.
- he asked as he picked up the phone River had examined and listened to it for a moment.
- the Doctor questioned Rory as he shut the TARDIS door, Amy and Olivia following
  River out of the room.
- Canton echoed.
- Canton asked Rory as they followed.
- Canton wondered.
- the Doctor guessed, making Olivia frown at him.
- Amy wondered as the group headed deeper into the warehouse.
- the Doctor grinned, rushing toward an open box and reaching into it.
- Olivia wondered.
- Amy frowned.
- Olivia giggled.
- the Doctor smirked.
- the Doctor shot back as Olivia burst into laughter.
- the Doctor smiled as he approached, Olivia, River and Amy remaining with the contraption
  to examine it.
- Amy retorted.
- Olivia shot back.
- the Doctor murmured as River scanned it with her handheld.
- the Doctor asked.
- Canton asked the Doctor who whirled around to look at the agent with wide eyes.
- the Doctor grinned in relief, patting the men on their shoulders before taking Olivia's
  hand to drag her after him.
- Olivia smirked as he knelt down to study more equipment, releasing her hand and
  looking over his shoulder at her with a frown.
- he wondered, looking away from her again.
- she repeated.
- the Doctor asked him as he stepped up on the other side of Olivia.
- Olivia wondered.
- she asked, but didn't stop him from placing his hands on her face, close to her
  temples.
- she echoed.
- she hoped when he set the thing down.
- Amy asked as Olivia frowned, the three examining the wires hanging from the ceiling.
- he asked.
- he asked.
- She stopped when she couldn't hear anyone following and looked behind her to see
  the Doctor and Amy talking.
- she hoped, helping her hobble along.
- Amy hoped.
- They turned to the door as the Doctor stood, all staring at the astronaut that was
  coming toward them.
- Amy shouted, shooting to her feet and lifting the gun.
- the Doctor shouted as she turned the gun on the little girl in the suit.
- Amy shouted back.
- Olivia screamed but it was too late.
- enjoy!
- She swallowed, panting from running and looked behind her again…only to gasp when
  the one of the suited aliens that made her forget she'd seen them stood a few feet
  away.
- She turned to retreat down the alley again, but came face to face with Canton, holding
  a pair of handcuffs in front of her face.
- Once the cuffs were off her wrists she fell to her knees in front of the Doctor
  and placed her hands on his face, smoothing his hair from it to look him in the
  eyes.
- She fell limp onto his lap as he stared down at her in shock at the seeping red
  spot on her back before lifting his gaze to Canton who held a smoking gun aimed
  at her.
- he ground out.
- she wondered, but he said nothing as he threw his arms around her and pulled her
  close, making her grin and return his embrace, hugging him tight.
- Rory complained, loudly as the Doctor stretched his arms and legs, quickly.
- Amy wondered.
- He snapped his fingers, opening the TARDIS door as he held a hand toward Olivia
  with a grin.
- he smirked and she took his hand to let him pull her close and whirl her into the
  open door of the TARDIS, Amy and Rory running in after her.
- Olivia asked Canton.
- They stopped for only a moment and when Amy and Rory returned to tell them River
  was on board, they lifted off again.
- his voice cracked.
- Canton wondered.
- River wondered.
- the Doctor announced, strolling around the console.
- he asked her, making her frown disappear.
- Olivia murmured, coming up next to the Doctor and taking his hand.
- Rory asked, coming up next to Amy, obviously not hearing any of the conversation.
- Canton asked the group.
- Canton wondered.
- Canton urged.
- Canton wondered.
- Canton wondered.
- he asked.
- Olivia frowned back at him.
- Olivia wondered.
- Nixon greeted the second man, holding his hand out for him to shake as well.
- the Doctor murmured to her.
- He didn't want to make her cry, or hurt her, but he had to know, and if anyone would
  tell him what was going on, it was Olivia.
- he questioned.
- They both looked to the Doctor as he trudged up the stairs and headed for the console
  to lean against it with a sigh.
- he wondered, noticing he wasn't in the room to stare at them.
- he questioned.
- enjoy!
- The three operated the TARDIS, following the address Canton gave them, and as soon
  as they landed they all ran out of the TARDIS and through the orphanage, hearing
  Canton call for Amy to stand back from the door as they ran up the stairs.
- It was filled with things you'd find in a small child's room, an astronaut's suit
  lying on the floor…but no Amy.
- Rory wondered as the Doctor used his Sonic on the suit, River kneeling at the helmet
  to lift the shield.
- River asked as the Doctor stepped closer to Rory to use the Sonic on it while he
  still held it.
- Olivia asked.
- she breathed and he placed his hand over hers.
- Olivia asked.
- Olivia wondered.
- the Doctor asked.
- She frowned and deflated as he ran toward the TV.
- Rory wondered.
- Rory asked when the Doctor trailed off.
- the Doctor wondered.
- River wondered at Olivia as they both examined the suit.
- Olivia wondered irritably, using her Sonic on the TV.
- Amy added.
- the Doctor called as Olivia grabbed his hand to pull him toward the TARDIS.
- she shouted over River's shooting and the Silence zapping.
- she demanded.
- Rory replied, making Olivia run toward the door again.
- the Doctor told River, using his Sonic on them as she shot them.
- Olivia shouted.
- he replied, standing back to back with River again.
- Olivia shot back, ducking again as she ran out to grab his arm and pull him toward
  the TARDIS.
- River called, still shooting.
- he echoed.
- he squeaked.
- Nixon murmured with a frown of wonder, but they ignored him as the Doctor stepped
  into the TARDIS after Olivia as she hurried toward the console with River by her
  side.
- he frowned in wonder at her, neither one of them noticing Rory and Amy retreat to
  the stairs leading beneath the console to give them privacy.
- enjoy!
- She looked up to see the Doctor and River talking and tried to turn it off, but
  no matter what she did, it wouldn't switch off.
- Rory frowned in wonder to no one in particular.
- he wondered honestly, stopping in front of her.
- River echoed as realization crossed her face and the Doctor looked to his watch,
  nervously.
- the Doctor hoped as she leaned on the console next to him.
- Olivia wondered.
- Olivia asked.
- the Doctor questioned.
- Amy shot back.
- the Doctor smirked as Olivia snickered.
- Amy shot back, unable to keep herself from laughing.
- she frowned at him in wonder as he looked to Amy, and Olivia could tell the wheels
  in his head were turning.
- he wondered.
- she whispered, breaking the comfortable silence.
- he hummed, neither one of them moving from the other's embrace.
- she wondered, and he was silent for a long moment before giving his answer.
- she wondered.
- she murmured, lifting her arm to rest it on his shoulders to thread her fingers
  through his hair as he worked.
- he replied, distracted with his work again.
- she wondered with a frown.
- he asked.
- he hissed, making Olivia giggle as she pressed the phone to her ear, helping him
  fly the TARDIS with one hand.
- Rory wondered as the three entered the living room and she turned to the couple.
- Amy whispered back.
- Olivia grinned when Joyce opened the door.
- enjoy!
- the Doctor called from the TARDIS door as Olivia hugged her mother and Aaron goodbye,
  Amy and Rory already inside.
- Amy questioned.
- Olivia muttered.
- Amy asked.
- Olivia guessed, operating the console as well.
- Rory wondered as the Doctor grabbed Olivia's hand to drag her toward the door.
- Olivia frowned in wonder as he opened the door then turned a grin to her.
- They both knocked on the wood when they heard voices nearby, and when they were
  finally able to open the cover the Doctor greeted the sailors crowded around the
  hatch.
- the captain frowned in confusion.
- the captain retorted and the Doctor snapped his fingers before pointing to him in
  approval.
- the first mate growled.
- Olivia snapped, struggling to be free as they were pulled across the deck, the plank
  being set up for them to walk out to sea.
- Avery announced.
- Olivia shouted, struggling as they were all dragged closer to the plank and the
  Doctor was shoved up onto the plank as they all laughed.
- Olivia snarled at him, still struggling against her captor with Amy and Rory doing
  the same.
- Olivia snarled as she and Amy were dragged away.
- Amy called.
- she called, and the other girl was soon at her side staring at the swords in wonder
  as Amy pulled one out.
- Amy shot back as Olivia spotted coats and hats hanging on hooks nearby.
- Olivia and Amy shouted, standing behind Avery, their swords drawn.
- the Doctor demanded.
- Olivia kept two of the men at bay as Amy fought with one other, the Doctor unable
  to help grinning as he watched them.
- Amy called, running toward a rope when they were being overwhelmed by their attackers
  and Olivia climbed after Amy as she grabbed a rope and she swung over the men, slashing
  her sword through the air and cutting one of them before she ended up on top of
  a barrel next to one of the masts.
- Rory ran toward her to help her and her sword cut him as Olivia climbed off the
  rigging to help Amy as well, the Doctor hurrying toward them as Olivia was caught
  by another man, but everyone stilled when they saw Rory look at his hand.
- he asked, lifting his hand to show off a black spot in the center of his palm.
- Rory echoed.
- Her eyes widened when she felt some tingling on her palm and immediately after,
  a black spot appeared in the center of it.
- Rory frowned.
- Amy ordered firmly when he went to hug her.
- Amy shot back.
- He reached out with a goofy grin as she held her hand toward him and when he barely
  touched the tip of her finger, he disappeared into a cloud of smoke.
- Olivia nearly whined as Avery pulled her down the hatch and the Doctor helped Amy
  stand, but caught sight of Rory stumbling toward the Siren.
- the Doctor called before letting Amy get down the hatch and running after him, pulling
  him away as he struggled.
- Avery snapped at him.
- Avery asked, skeptically as they looked to the TARDIS.
- Amy shouted.
- the Doctor ordered and everyone hurriedly climbed out, Amy dragging Rory with her
  as he was currently dead, foolish weight, and the Doctor lifted Olivia up effortlessly
  next to him.
- Amy retorted to the sailor.
- Olivia strained against him as the sailor stood to head toward her and Amy held
  Rory back.
- His hat fell into the water and the Doctor grabbed it before helping Amy drag Rory
  and Olivia out of the room and into another where they locked themselves in.
- Amy retorted, sarcastically.
- Avery demanded as the Doctor looked to the results.
- Amy shot back as she tried to fight off Rory's clingy-ness and Olivia hugged the
  Doctor's arm, setting her chin on his shoulder as he slid the hat on his head and
  she giggled.
- Amy frowned in wonder.
- Avery demanded but the Doctor stepped toward the door and only shoved it slightly
  to open it, making it creak as it rolled in its hinges.
- He pulled Olivia inside as the others followed.
- the Doctor wondered, as if he were one of the three bears looking for Goldilocks.
- the first mate questioned.
- the Doctor wondered.
- Avery examined him from head to toe, looking for any injuries, and the Doctor pulled
  Olivia back toward Amy and Rory, but when she didn't move he frowned down at her.
- he noticed.
- Avery warned the Doctor, drawing his gun again.
- The Doctor ran toward him and grabbed the lid to shove it over the barrel again,
  cutting the Siren off.
- Amy asked the Doctor.
- enjoy!
- Olivia called, standing and heading toward them, Toby right next to her.
- the first mate snapped, drawing his pistol and Toby lifted the cutlass again.
- They all jumped when they heard a gunshot from outside and Olivia resisted the urge
  to look at the door as she twirled her Psychic Band on her ring finger, nervously.
- She smiled as she watched him polish it with a rag, but jumped again when rapid
  knocking came to the door.
- the Doctor shouted from the other side.
- She was about to question him as he gave a thumbs up to Avery but he ran out of
  the room, the captain right behind him.
- Rory questioned the plan.
- she ground out.
- Rory questioned.
- she growled in pain before the door flung open to reveal a soaking wet Doctor as
  Rory and Toby awoke as well.
- Olivia grinned as she set to work with the rest of them.
- Amy shouted as she pulled on a rope.
- Rory shouted to Avery.
- She shoved herself off and ran past Toby just as he came on deck.
- Rory shouted back, hanging on the rigging.
- The Siren's Song began as she emerged from the crown and rose into the air before
  floating down to land in front of Toby who stared at her in awe.
- She instantly frowned as she sat up and looked around the dark…very futuristic surroundings.
- She jumped when she heard three thumps come from behind her and whirled around to
  see Avery, Amy and the Doctor lying on the ground, unconscious.
- It didn't take long for her eyes to flutter shut as she matched his passion, wrapping
  her arms around his neck as he laid back and pulled her with him.
- Amy asked, looking around in wonder.
- Amy wondered.
- Avery drew his gun to aim it at the thing, but the Doctor placed his hand on Avery's
  to lower the gun.
- Olivia wondered as the Doctor pulled out his Sonic to scan the skeleton.
- Amy wondered.
- The Doctor used his Sonic on the room as they slowly stepped into it staring at
  the bodies on tables tiered in three levels around them.
- Amy called as she hurried toward Rory on a table.
- He hugged it then turned to lean back on it as Olivia couldn't help but giggle at
  his relief.
- Amy asked them both.
- They watched as the Siren appeared and stepped toward Rory who seemed to seize as
  he looked to her but she placed a hand on his chest, still singing, and he stilled.
- Olivia shouted, but he ignored her and shot at the Siren who turned to shriek at
  him as she turned red and marched toward him.
- Olivia suddenly sneezed, drawing the Siren's attention, and she remained red as
  she lifted her hands, fire bursting between them.
- Amy ran back to Rory, trying to unhook him from the machine, catching the Siren's
  attention.
- Olivia growled, raising her hands to her head and tousling her damp hair in frustration.
- the Doctor ordered everyone, pacing in front of Olivia.
- Amy snapped, still trying to unhook Rory from the machine, the Siren still approaching
  her.
- Olivia gasped in realization just as he stopped pacing.
- When the Doctor used the Sonic, Rory shouted loudly in pain as the alarm on his
  machine went off and he looked as if he were choking.
- Olivia urged and when Amy obeyed Rory rested back on the table.
- he asked her.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy echoed in a scoff, tears rolling down her cheeks.
- Avery questioned.
- the Doctor wondered.
- The Doctor patted his shoulder and held his hand toward Olivia, who took it as she
  smiled and nodded goodbye to Avery as she was led back to Amy and Rory.
- She and the Doctor watched Amy give Rory CPR, pumping his chest then breathing into
  his mouth.
- Olivia wiped her tears away with a grin as the Doctor stood next to her and she
  threw her arms around him in happiness.
- she wondered, making him finally look down at her.
- enjoy!
- Rory asked Amy as she came down the stairs.
- The four spun toward the door to stare at it with wide eyes.
- Amy wondered.
- The couple stepped back in to stare at it just as it came charging back toward them
  and slammed into the Doctor's chest and when he fell, Olivia knelt to help him.
- Rory frowned in wonder as it fell to the floor and the Doctor picked it up.
- Amy wondered as he stood, staring at the box in his hands.
- Rory shouted over the whirring of the engines.
- the Doctor called back.
- Amy questioned, clinging to the console.
- Olivia questioned and he looked back at her with a grin.
- Rory wondered as the Doctor and Olivia worked at the console, frantically.
- Rory asked him.
- Olivia wondered, breathlessly.
- He opened the door and cautiously stepped out, still holding Olivia's hand as Amy
  and Rory followed and they all frowned in wonder at their junkyard surroundings.
- Amy wondered.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy wondered if she had it right, holding an old soup spoon.
- the woman warned as the younger woman ran up to the Doctor and grabbed his shoulders.
- she before planting her lips to the Doctor's.
- They all finally managed to pull her away from him and she laughed as the couple
  that had come after her pulled her behind them and the Doctor straightened himself
  out.
- the other woman replied before grabbing the Doctor and biting his neck, making Olivia
  and Uncle shove her away as she laughed again.
- the Doctor shouted, lifting a hand to rub it, but Olivia moved his hand to examine
  it and make sure it wasn't bleeding.
- Olivia snapped as she lunged for him, sending the Doctor behind Amy and Rory to
  hide as Olivia stepped in front of the couple, Auntie and Uncle keeping the woman
  at bay.
- Auntie pleaded.
- Rory frowned.
- Olivia asked.
- the Doctor murmured near her ear.
- Amy questioned.
- Amy and Rory rushed toward Olivia as she fell to her knees, holding her head and
  a moment later the Ood clicked the ball and it shut off, making the voices disappear.
- the Doctor asked as Nephew picked Idris up and took her away.
- Rory frowned in wonder.
- he guessed, and she nodded.
- Olivia frowned in wonder.
- Olivia whispered.
- Rory wondered.
- Rory hoped.
- Amy asked, making the Doctor feel at his jacket.
- Rory wondered if he'd heard right.
- he answered, heading down the hall again.
- she wondered, letting him pull her left hand into his left hand as he stepped behind
  her.
- The Doctor turned them with his feet before he released her but kept a hold on her
  hand as he stepped toward a patchwork curtain and moved it away to reveal a small
  inner room of sorts.
- Olivia placed a hand on her head as the voices intensified before fading away, then
  jumped when Uncle and Auntie suddenly strolled up next to her.
- the Doctor murmured, making her frown at him in wonder.
- he ordered into the phone before grabbing Olivia's hand and dragging her through
  the halls.
- she questioned, stumbling behind the Doctor.
- enjoy!
- he demanded, making Idris chuckle.
- she questioned.
- He looked to Olivia who was staring at Idris before she looked back at him in wonder.
- she questioned.
- She looked to Olivia as she stepped up to them, glancing between them before meeting
  Idris' gaze.
- she asked Olivia.
- Olivia wondered with a frown.
- he asked before sniffing his jacket as she had.
- the Doctor questioned.
- the Doctor frowned.
- he wondered.
- Olivia frowned in wonder as Idris looked to her.
- Olivia shouted into the phone.
- Amy reported.
- Olivia shouted at him as they ran toward the TARDIS.
- he shot back.
- Olivia snapped, pulling him back to his senses before he turned and grabbed her
  hand to run back into the building where Idris sat in front of her cage.
- Idris asked.
- the Doctor demanded, marching toward them as they wrapped blankets around themselves.
- The Doctor ran toward her to examine her as Uncle stood.
- the Doctor snapped, stumbling over his body.
- the Doctor shouted at the bodies.
- Olivia snapped, making him whirl around in time to see her vomit.
- He ran toward her, avoiding the sick as he sat on the other side of her, Idris still
  holding her ponytail back as he pulled out a handkerchief as Olivia finished, panting
  for breath.
- he questioned.
- he snapped at Idris.
- Olivia frowned and the Doctor stood to head toward Idris as she turned to him.
- He looked up at her with wide eyes.
- Idris asked.
- Olivia asked, slowly rising to her feet just as he grabbed her hand.
- the Doctor smirked.
- He stepped ahead to lead the way through the junkyard and they stopped on a hill
  to look over the landscape.
- he strained under the weight of the panel.
- She sat on an old seat in the pile, watching Idris gather things they needed then
  glanced to the Doctor as he worked on the construction of the console.
- Idris called to the Doctor from a pile she was looking through as he carried something
  toward the console.
- Olivia wondered, still working.
- Olivia called as he ran around her.
- Idris asked the Doctor, examining a coat hanger in her hands.
- She giggled when Idris poked and squished her own face.
- Olivia questioned with a frown.
- enjoy!
- Olivia shouted over the energy surrounding them and engine's noise as they flew
  through space on the console.
- Idris explained as they all worked on the console.
- Olivia called before being thrown back into the half wall around the console as
  Idris positioned herself in front of the mirror.
- Rory said from the mirror.
- the Doctor questioned before being thrashed back again.
- Idris explained.
- Olivia grinned, giving an exaggerated wink to Idris.
- he replied before the console thrashed again.
- Olivia screamed, making him look up in time to see her stumble off the edge.
- The console thrashed and Olivia was thrown up and onto the floor again, making the
  Doctor stumble back, still holding her hand.
- he shouted, pulling her hand toward it so that she could grip it as they both stood.
- she shouted.
- Idris shouted as the console sparked and smoked.
- The first control room she'd been introduced to when the TARDIS had landed in her
  room years ago.
- Amy called as they stood and the Doctor shot to his feet to hug Amy tightly.
- Amy squeaked in disbelief.
- Amy wondered, making Olivia burst into laughter so hard she doubled over.
- Rory asked.
- They all groaned as they tried to get up, and a moment later they were released
  from their own weight to stand, but when Idris stood, she fell to the floor again,
  and Rory rushed to her side to aid her.
- the Doctor managed to call and the air returned to the room, unstantly.
- Amy snapped at the Doctor.
- he asked.
- the Doctor grinned.
- Olivia frowned at him before he held up a hand to silence her.
- she called, then noticed the Doctor glancing at Idris and Rory.
- The TARDIS matrix.
- Olivia looked to where Idris' body had been only to find it was gone and when she
  looked up behind the Doctor she saw her on the stair.
- She reached up without a word and brushed a tear from his cheek.
- Rory asked, looking down at the Doctor through the glass floor as the Time Lord
  sat in his swing beneath it the console.
- Amy wondered through the glass as well, half serious, half in jest.
- Rory wondered, heading down the stairs to stand next to Olivia as she watched him
  as well.
- Amy guessed.
- the Doctor asked as he examined the circuits.
- Rory wondered, but Amy quickly grabbed his arm to drag him up the stairs to find
  their room before the Doctor could answer, Olivia remaining on the stair, watching
  him work.
- Olivia laughed, before shouted in delight when he grabbed her hand and Waltzed her
  around the console.
- Olivia giggled as the Doctor pulled her through the halls of the TARDIS, stopping
  at a door and grinning down at her.
- she grinned, hugging his arm and kissing his cheek.
- he grinned, running toward the bed to climb the ladder and flop onto the mattress
  on the top.
- she smirked, stepping toward him to sit on the edge of the mattress, smiling down
  at him.
- She hung up the robe and didn't stop him when his arms slid around her waist to
  pull her against him, setting his chin on her shoulder.
- It did nothing to ease her nerves, but she said nothing else, not wanting to start
  an argument since they were both still raw from this latest adventure.
- enjoy!
- She giggled giddily as she stopped next to the Doctor, hugging his arm before looking
  to the scanner as well and her smile fell.
- she wondered with a frown, finally making him glance at her then look to Amy.
- she smiled, making him smile back at her before planting a kiss to her cheek and
  shutting the music off.
- Rory asked as the Doctor ran around the console.
- They all shouted, grabbing onto the console as it thrashed again, and Olivia managed
  to keep herself in front of the scanner as the Doctor tried to pull himself toward
  her when she examined it.
- Rory called, hanging onto the railing.
- A moment later the TARDIS came to a halt and the Doctor pulled away from Olivia
  to glance around the control room as she stared at him with a wide-eyed frown.
- she squeaked, standing tall and straightening herself out.
- Amy wondered, slowly getting up from her seat with Rory right next to her.
- Amy wondered as they marched through the courtyard.
- Amy guessed.
- Amy called to him as she ran back to pull him along with them.
- The Doctor led them through the building and finally into a huge room filled with
  machinery and harnesses with people in orange jumpsuits lying in them.
- Amy wondered as they followed the Doctor.
- Rory guessed.
- Olivia wondered as the Doctor stopped them toward the other exit.
- a Scotsman with white hair shouted at them, pointing some kind of weapon at them
  as two other people came up next to him, all in orange jumpsuits…two with the same
  faces as two of the men in the harnesses.
- the Doctor smiled.
- Amy wondered, noticing it as well.
- Amy frowned in wonder.
- Cleaves asked.
- The Doctor instantly went up to it, releasing Olivia's hand as she stepped up to
  the side, staring wide eyes at it as he went around, opposite her.
- Olivia breathed.
- Buzzer finished, bitterly.
- Amy called.
- Cleaves asked Buzzer as the Doctor strolled back toward the group, Olivia following
  him.
- Ganger Jennifer sat up with a gasp for air, making Amy, Rory and Olivia jump back
  as she looked up at the Doctor.
- he questioned, tucking the snow globe away again.
- They stumbled down the halls and the stairs as the building shook again and into
  the monitoring station with computers in the center of the room.
- She followed him until he stopped when he came to a door leading onto the roof where
  he could get to the weather vane, the solar storm raging overhead.
- she asked him, both watching the weather vane twirl on its stand.
- he reported.
- She screamed when he suddenly seized while touching something in the box, sending
  him flying back, off the ladder and landing on his back at her feet.
- enjoy!
- She recognized it as her name as she struggled out of the darkness, pain throbbing
  in her head.
- the Doctor hoped, looking her over as she lifted a hand to her head.
- She seemed disoriented.
- Olivia asked him as they stopped at a turn.
- Jimmy wondered.
- He turned to her in surprise before looking back at Jennifer.
- Jennifer turned and ran into one of the toilet stalls, making Olivia frown and shove
  off the wall to head toward the sink.
- Olivia choked, pulling at the hand around her throat to push it away but another
  hole burst through the bathroom stall door, Jennifer's face slithering out of it,
  pale and sickly, her eyes glazed over with white film.
- she growled an inch from Olivia's face as she stared wide, jade eyes back at her,
  still choking.
- The hand finally released her, making her cough and gasp as she fell back against
  the mirror and sit on the sink counter.
- he refused.
- Olivia coughed, shoving him away.
- She froze when she heard footsteps rushing down the stone steps, but relaxed again
  when Jimmy led the Doctor and Amy into the room.
- Amy questioned.
- the Doctor snapped.
- he replied, making her grit her teeth in irritation but she kept silent as they
  went up another set of stairs.
- the Doctor reported.
- Amy argued.
- Amy insisted as he stepped around them to head back, dragging Olivia with him.
- he asked him.
- It bubbled in agitation as he scanned it and Olivia could see the wheels turning
  in his head again before he pulled the Sonic back and led her out of the room.
- Olivia wondered as he pulled her toward the stairs leading to the TARDIS.
- the Doctor groaned, stepping onto the grass as Olivia remained on the stairs.
- he asked as they reached a door and he used the Sonic on it to unlock it.
- she wondered.
- Olivia noticed, seeing them sitting on the floor as the Doctor pulled her toward
  them.
- Olivia jumped back at the sight of their faces, not fully formed as Jennifer's had
  been.
- Ganger Cleaves retorted.
- Ganger Cleaves wondered.
- Ganger Cleaves asked.
- She checked the size on them before hurrying back to the Doctor and handing them
  over.
- Buzzer breathed.
- Jimmy wondered with a smile.
- Cleaves shouted, coming up behind the group holding something small in one hand
  that was attached by a wire to a box in her other hand.
- Cleaves snapped.
- Amy demanded.
- Rory called, seeing her eyes change as everyone looked to her as well.
- Jennifer snarled.
- the Doctor shouted to the rest of the Gangers who ran from the room, and Cleaves
  stood, sending everyone's glares to her as Olivia marched toward the Doctor to hand
  him the probe.
- enjoy!
- Jimmy asked when they reached the door to the chapel and the Doctor opened it to
  let everyone in before him.
- Amy ordered him.
- Ganger Cleaves called from the end of the hall, two more of the Gangers with her.
- The Doctor grabbed Amy's arm and pulled her back into the room, Olivia slamming
  the door behind them.
- Amy shouted, trying to get to the door again.
- Olivia called when he slowly stepped, deeper into the room.
- Olivia cried.
- the Doctor asked.
- Ganger Doctor screamed before shoving the Doctor away, making him stumble into Olivia
  as Cleaves and Jimmy held Amy back when she tried to help.
- she hissed.
- Ganger Doctor wondered, making Olivia frown between them as she pulled away from
  Ganger Doctor, but he kept his arms around her waist.
- Amy wondered.
- the Doctor to her right asked.
- Amy called as the banging continued, the crew standing around the door, bracing
  for a fight.
- they ordered her, making her jump with a start.
- The one holding her hand wore his usual shoes, the one to her left wore the worker's
  shoes.
- the Doctor holding Olivia's hand asked.
- Ganger Doctor wondered.
- the Doctor called, using his Sonic on the grated door of the vent.
- They crawled ahead and it wasn't long before they were crawling out, Ganger Doctor
  helping Olivia out and keeping a hold on her hand as the Doctor and Cleaves climbed
  out as well.
- Cleaves questioned.
- Cleaves reported, leading them down the hall.
- The Doctor let them all in, Amy stumbling after him as the crew hurried toward the
  computers in the room.
- Olivia asked the Doctors as she ran toward the back on the panel to watch them work.
- Cleaves questioned.
- Olivia grinned, glancing between them.
- Amy wondered at her, making Olivia frown in wonder at Amy before shrugging.
- Ganger Doctor cheered.
- she smirked.
- Ganger Doctor wondered when she looked to him.
- he snapped.
- she retorted.
- Amy pleaded.
- Olivia whispered to the Doctor.
- enjoy!
- Amy asked him.
- he hummed.
- She suddenly jumped and gasped, making the Doctor turn in his chair, Ganger Doctor
  and Olivia glancing at her as well, all in concern as she turned to the Doctor then
  looked back at the wall.
- he asked.
- Ganger Doctor whispered to Olivia.
- Amy prompted.
- Jimmy called as he stepped out.
- Cleaves snapped.
- he murmured and she nodded, hugely.
- she snapped, making Olivia stand as Ganger Doctor followed Amy in, shutting the
  door as the girls switched places, Amy next to the Doctor, Olivia next to his Ganger.
- Ganger Doctor asked the Doctor.
- Olivia frowned, glancing between them.
- Olivia scolded, incredulously.
- Amy snapped back at her, making Olivia shrink back, slightly before looking to Ganger
  Doctor.
- Olivia didn't falter as she only glared at Amy, turning to pace again.
- Olivia shot back, stepping within an inch of Amy to shout in her face.
- the Doctor snapped from his chair, making Olivia step back, but she and Amy remained
  glaring at each other.
- the Doctor smirked, trying to lighten the mood and keep the girls from coming to
  blows.
- Olivia snapped, marching out from around the panel.
- He took her hand to pull her to his knee, wrapping his arms around her waist as
  she perched on his knee.
- Olivia snarled, moving to stand, but Ganger Doctor kept his arms firmly around her
  waist to keep her on his knee.
- the Doctor snapped.
- the Doctor asked his Ganger.
- she snapped.
- he asked, looking ahead again.
- Buzzer wondered.
- Olivia wondered.
- she snapped.
- When his breath fanned her ear she sighed in relief and gently shoved his head.
- Ganger Jimmy asked, nodding to Olivia as Ganger Doctor sat up then stood, pulling
  her with him by the arm.
- Olivia snapped before he shoved her toward Gangers Jimmy and Dicken who caught an
  arm each on her to drag her struggling behind Gangers Doctor and Cleaves who led
  the way until they reached a fork in the trail.
- Once they stepped through the plastic draped over the doorway, Gangers Jimmy and
  Dicken shoved Olivia inside, making her stumble before she turned to Ganger Doctor
  pacing a feet steps away from her.
- Rory snapped, stepping toward Olivia and wrapping a protective arm around her shoulders.
- Rory shouted, marching toward him again, but Ganger Doctor only shoved him back
  again.
- he called again as Olivia took Rory's arm.
- Olivia cut in.
- Adam cheered.
- Jennifer demanded as Ganger Dicken ran to fulfill his order.
- she wondered.
- Rory instantly headed toward Amy, and Olivia hurried toward the Doctor to hug him,
  tightly.
- Adam cheered, making Jimmy laugh.
- Olivia asked the Doctor and he shook his head solemnly, making her heart clench
  in sadness as she instantly understood.
- Adam wondered the Ganger Doctor stepped up behind Jimmy.
- Adam cheered and did a little dance, making Jimmy laugh as Olivia couldn't help
  but giggle before her gaze went to Ganger Doctor when he whirled around to face
  everyone.
- enjoy!
- She started growing and mutating into…they didn't know what, but it was becoming
  bigger.
- Olivia shouted as the two Doctors dragged her back again and they all ducked into
  a room, shutting the door behind them.
- the Doctor noticed as he stood in a corner, staring at the ceiling, the other Doctor
  standing near the door.
- Ganger Dicken watched him but a moment later they heard a door slam and he shouted
  in agony.
- Ganger Dicken shouted before closing the door, knowing there was nothing he could
  do as one Doctor stepped to the door to help him hold it, the other Doctor still
  staring at the ceiling.
- Rory headed for the TARDIS when Olivia opened the door with a grin.
- Dicken murmured, looking around in awe.
- Amy said as she, one of the Doctor's and Ganger Cleaves remained at the door where
  Olivia caught up with the other Doctor and Rory.
- Amy wondered, glancing between them, her mind reeling.
- he frowned, neither one letting go.
- Rory called, making Amy turn and run toward the TARDIS as Olivia remained with the
  Doctor.
- Ganger Doctor smirked before Olivia pulled away to look up at him.
- Amy called, wanting to save both Doctors, but they all stopped when Ganger Cleaves
  didn't follow them.
- she shouted at the four watching them, making them turn and hurry into the TARDIS.
- She looked to the Doctor with a smile, but his returning smile wasn't as happy as
  she'd seen it before.
- she asked.
- The four followed Cleaves and Dicken out and toward the double doors with press
  and media behind them.
- Cleaves wondered.
- Amy wondered, seeing it as well.
- Amy demanded, fed up with the mystery.
- he demanded.
- Roy echoed.
- Amy questioned.
- He nodded to her, making her look to Amy with the same wide eyes.
- the Doctor snapped.
- Rory gasped when he snapped it open, wanting to run to Amy and protect her, but
  he knew he couldn't.
- Olivia shuddered, making Rory look up at him in wonder as well.
- the lead Cyber questioned.
- Rory retorted.
- Olivia asked the Doctor as they ran around the console.
- Several moments later there was a knock on the door and the Doctor ran toward it
  to open it with a grin.
- he frowned, watching her.
- the Doctor cheered as a Sontaran marched in, the Doctor shutting the door behind
  him.
- Olivia grinned, running around the console as the Doctor sailed up next to her.
- he announced.
- Rory wondered.
- The TARDIS dematerialized just as they found River in winter Victorian clothes,
  sauntering in their direction.
- Olivia wondered as Rory frowned at her.
- Rory frowned in wonder.
- Rory asked River as she turned to them again.
- she teased.
- Rory sneered and Olivia placed a hand on his shoulder to calm him.
- Rory demanded.
- Olivia cut in, gently as she looked to him and he sighed through his nose before
  heading down the hall.
- She was greeted with the sight of the Doctor leaning out the TARDIS door, frowning
  at her.
- the Doctor demanded, stepping next to her as she operated the console.
- enjoy!
- they all cheered.
- A moment later the lights returned, the Doctor gone from the platform and Manton
  glanced around the room.
- Manton called.
- The monks began attacking the Clerics until Manton spoke up again.
- the Doctor permitted.
- Manton ground out.
- Olivia wondered, stumbling behind his march.
- He searched the doors down the hall before stepping closer to one and it opened,
  revealing Amy and Rory in a white room at the bottom of a set of stairs.
- Olivia scolded, blocking his exit.
- Amy asked as she, Rory and Olivia frowned up at him.
- Rory asked, humoring him.
- She'd had a feeling it was all too easy.
- the Doctor asked Olivia, stepping up to her with a frown and she shook her wide-eyed
  stare away to smile brightly.
- When they reached the TARDIS he pulled his arm from her grip, making her frown up
  at him in wonder.
- Rory wondered as they heard the TARDIS warbling and the engines running, but it
  remained in its spot.
- Rory asked her as she approached.
- Amy smiled.
- Rory wondered to the Doctor as Olivia rocked Melody for a moment.
- she smiled, making him shake his head.
- she wondered and Melody made her little baby noises.
- she wondered.
- the Doctor asked Rory who nodded.
- he asked.
- Olivia wondered.
- Amy wondered.
- Rory asked.
- the Doctor asked, slinging his arm around Olivia's neck to pull her close.
- he asked.
- she ground out.
- Vastra asked, making him frown.
- he echoed, making her sigh as Olivia giggled.
- Olivia couldn't help but smirk.
- Vastra asked again.
- Olivia blurted when he trailed off.
- Vastra wondered.
- Vastra prompted, glancing between them before the Doctor answered.
- enjoy!
- Vastra guessed.
- he questioned.
- he frowned as she stepped toward him.
- the Doctor questioned.
- Olivia nearly screamed at the screen.
- Her hands went to her mouth to cover her gasp as she stared at all the dead monks
  on the floor before looking to Rory.
- The Doctor approached, making Amy slowly look up at him as he stopped a foot or
  so away.
- He took a step toward her as Olivia remained on the crate with Jenny, but Amy moved
  back from him.
- Olivia recognized that as a sign of defeat, and realized instantly that it wasn't
  good for Lorna.
- he asked her.
- he shot back, looming over her.
- River asked, making him pull back from Olivia and turn to her.
- he demanded.
- Olivia stepped around River to stare at her in awe and disbelief along with the
  Doctor.
- he asked, his chest puffed with pride, suddenly.
- Amy demanded as Olivia stepped into the TARDIS followed by the Doctor who took a
  moment to marvel at River before stepping fully into the box and shutting the door.
- Olivia cheered as she operated the console.
- he grinned, hurrying up the stairs to operate it as well.
- she grinned back as she sailed up next to him.
- he wondered, crossing over to flip a switch in front of her.
- he wondered, making her frown before realization dawned on her and she grinned,
  but didn't move.
- She flipped a switch on the console of the TARDIS as the Doctor looked to her around
  the cylinder between them.
- he asked.
- she asked, making him frown and hurry up next to her.
- enjoy!
- the Doctor asked, pointing to the headline on the newspaper.
- the Doctor asked Rory, handing Olivia the paper.
- the Doctor asked Olivia.
- Amy realized, pulling back from him.
- They all screamed as it came to the clearing, charging toward them.
- The rear tire stopped an inch away from her, successfully pinning her between it
  and the TARDIS and she watched the young, gorgeous, black woman with long cornrows,
  a flowy dress and high boots climb out of the car to stand in front of the Doctor
  as he lay sprawled on the ground.
- Rory called, making Olivia frown at her with wide eyes.
- she squeaked.
- Amy questioned Mels.
- Mels retorted, as the Doctor pulled himself up using the car.
- Rory snapped.
- Olivia ground out.
- Olivia snapped, making him jump and hurry toward her to help her out of her tight
  spot.
- Mels turned to aim a gun at them, making them freeze as she cocked it and they both
  lifted their hands in surrender.
- Amy screamed.
- Rory shouted.
- Amy snapped.
- the Doctor wondered, making Olivia glare at him.
- the Doctor muttered, turning to open the door.
- Olivia ground out as he opened the door.
- he snapped back, grabbing her hand and dragging her inside as Amy, Rory and Mels
  followed them in.
- Olivia shot back as she followed the Doctor up the stairs toward the console.
- Mels smirked, sauntering around Olivia who gave her a glare as she helped the Doctor
  operate the console.
- Amy shouted just before a gunshot rang out and the TARDIS thrashed uncontrollably,
  sending everyone stumbling around the room as smoke billowed around them.
- Olivia shrieked at Mels as she held onto the railing of the stairs, the TARDIS still
  thrashing in flight.
- she shot back as he stumbled toward the railing and loomed over her as they both
  held onto it.
- he shouted before running back toward the console.
- Amy shouted.
- he coughed before slamming a lever down on the console and the TARDIS shuddered
  violently before finally coming to a stop.
- Amy demanded as they all coughed, not noticing the two other men in the room.
- the Doctor replied.
- Rory coughed.
- Olivia shouted, running toward her to pull her away from the door of the TARDIS,
  taking the gun from her in the process.
- He placed it in the fruit bowl just as the man ducked behind the desk stood, Olivia
  realizing something as she looked to the man on the floor and hurrying toward the
  Doctor.
- Olivia ground out as she sailed up next to him, making him frown at her before turning
  toward the TARDIS where Hitler stood.
- Olivia called, seeing the other man stand from his place on the floor and Hitler
  looked terrified.
- Hitler called, drawing his gun and aiming it at him.
- Rory punched Hitler in the face, sending him to the ground before he grabbed the
  gun and aimed it at Hitler when he sat up and stared at Rory with wide eyes.
- Amy asked the man as she tried to help him.
- Hitler told Rory of the man.
- Rory snapped, still holding the gun at him.
- Amy called, drawing their attention to her as Olivia only watched Mels.
- the Doctor asked.
- Amy called as the other three ran toward her, seeing her gunshot wound.
- Rory demanded as Olivia grabbed his arm and the Doctor did the same on Amy, pulling
  them to their feet.
- Olivia asked, knowingly.
- Amy breathed.
- Amy, Rory and the Doctor ducked and looked away but Olivia stared at the regeneration
  in terror.
- Olivia blurted.
- She rolled her eyes and shook her head as River tapped her teeth together.
- River asked, peeking into the room as they looked at her.
- Rory questioned.
- Rory wondered.
- River sighed as the Doctor took the banana.
- he wondered.
- Olivia questioned.
- Amy and Rory ducked as Rory screamed, but the Doctor held up the magazine for her
  gun, full of bullets.
- Olivia ground out, still trying to pull away from River's grip, but it was tighter
  than she expected.
- the Doctor called, drawing their attention to him.
- Olivia snarled in her face, but turned a wide-eyed stare to the Doctor when he gasped
  in pain and fell to the floor.
- Olivia cried when he touched his lips, both realizing it was River's kiss, and Olivia
  struggled harder to be free of River's grip.
- River jumped down from the window sill, dragging Olivia with her, even as she struggled
  and screamed on the way down.
- enjoy!
- They all aimed their guns at them just as Olivia yanked her arm from River's grip.
- the higher ranking solder questioned.
- When it stopped, River still stood and Olivia rolled onto her back to stare up at
  her as she looked up at the men, her hands over her stomach.
- Amy called as she and Rory had climbed down after them, Olivia reluctantly straddling
  the bike as River climbed on behind her.
- Olivia shouted over the sound of the engine.
- River wasted no time in grabbing the guns slung over her shoulders, aiming them
  at the ceiling and firing at it, making everyone in the room panic and duck under
  their tables.
- River gave a girlish giggle before aiming a gun at Olivia who looked to her with
  a frown.
- Olivia questioned, sardonically as the room emptied.
- She dumped her guns on the table and flopped into a seat, and River left her own
  guns on the table as well before gathering several clothes from the floor and finding
  a mirror to begin trying stuff on.
- River sighed, picking up a hat to examine it and put it on.
- River smirked, mockingly as if she wouldn't answer any of them.
- Olivia sighed as she stepped in front of her, blocking her reflection and sending
  River's green gaze at her in surprise.
- Their attention was drawn to the door when Amy ran in, a serious look over her face
  and Olivia stared at her with wide eyes as River looked at her through the mirror
  in exasperation.
- It attacked her, making her back up and struggled to be free of it, making Olivia
  lift her Sonic to use it on the thing that looked like Amy.
- River shouted.
- River breathed in disbelief.
- He looked alright.
- River questioned.
- She came to a halt and struggled, trying to get away from the light, crying out
  in pain.
- Olivia shouted, standing in an attempt to help her, but the Doctor's voice and his
  hand on her wrist stopped her.
- Olivia questioned, gesturing to River as she moaned in pain.
- Olivia retorted.
- she questioned.
- he whispered.
- Olivia called when his legs gave way and he dropped his cane as he and Olivia tumbled
  to the floor.
- Amy questioned.
- Olivia stood and stepped toward her, taking her hand and looking into her eyes.
- The three crowded around him, Olivia on his left with Amy and Rory kneeling on his
  right as he glanced between them, River standing away from them to watch them.
- River backed toward them and looked to Olivia, their gazes meeting.
- she asked, making the three stare at her with wide eyes before Olivia looked to
  Amy as she stepped toward the robot of herself.
- Amy wondered as she and Rory approached the console where the Doctor and Olivia
  worked.
- Amy asked, trying to see the screen as well.
- Rory asked.
- he smirked before turning and dragging Olivia behind him.
- Olivia giggled as he turned down a hall and she gave a squeak when he spun and pressed
  her against the wall, smirking down at her.
- She pulled back to look up at him then lifted a hand to smack him upside the head.
- enjoy!
- Amy and Rory chatted as the Doctor still watched Olivia and strolled around the
  console to step next to her.
- she chirped, grabbing the rail under the scanner to pull it toward her and look
  at the screen.
- She leaned on the console and held a hand to her head as pain flared behind her
  eyes.
- the Doctor asked, gripping her shoulders and turning her toward him as she seemed
  to slowly recover.
- he asked as she looked away from him to focus.
- the Doctor called, reaching into his jacket pocket with a frown and looked at the
  Psychic Paper.
- She rolled her eyes and nodded before pulling away from his grip to head out of
  the TARDIS and into the courtyard of a block of flats.
- the Doctor guessed, shutting the door behind him.
- Amy frowned in wonder.
- The Doctor glanced down at his hand as it still held Olivia's, then glanced at her.
- she questioned, making the couple frown in wonder.
- the Doctor replied.
- the Doctor asked.
- Rory asked.
- Amy wondered, making Olivia giggle.
- As the door opened the Doctor pulled out his Psychic Paper to show whatever credentials
  he wanted the man that opened the door to see.
- Olivia asked as the Doctor looked to his Psychic Paper in wonder.
- Olivia wondered as the Doctor took the album to look at it.
- Alex frowned.
- Alex asked George in the room.
- George asked.
- he finally asked of Olivia and she smiled as she stepped toward the bed to kneel
  next to him.
- Alex stood to turn on the light as the Doctor sat at the foot of George's bed, Olivia
  standing to sit next to him on the mattress as well.
- Alex guessed, pacing in front of them.
- They all jumped and gasped, the Doctor whirling around when they heard pounding.
- He pressed the button to make it glow, the sound filling the room and catching George's
  attention.
- George asked.
- George hoped.
- she called.
- Alex wondered as Olivia remained on the bed with George, wrapping an arm around
  him and pulling him close.
- She was about to follow them out when George gripped her hand as she stood, making
  her look to him in wonder but he only stared up at her.
- Alex guessed.
- Alex questioned.
- Olivia wondered as he turned to them.
- Alex panicked.
- Olivia asked the Doctor as he downed the last of his tea.
- enjoy!
- The Doctor moved the clothes hanging inside, stared down at the dollhouse and other
  toys then looked back at the three.
- she asked.
- the Doctor guessed, taking the album from her to look at it as well.
- Olivia wondered, pointing to the pictures in the album.
- the Doctor wondered.
- Olivia asked, as Alex frowned, still trying to remember.
- the Doctor wondered.
- She stood when George looked to his lamp and it shone brightly before George shot
  his gaze to the cupboard behind them and the door shot open, suddenly starting to
  pull Alex, Olivia and the Doctor toward it.
- Alex called, trying to keep himself from being sucked into the cupboard.
- George started chanting, curling up on his bed as it seemed to shrink, his bed shifting
  closer and closer to the cupboard.
- Olivia screamed, trying to brace herself against the cupboard doors, but it did
  no good and she was sucked in with a scream, along with the other two.
- Alex questioned and they both looked to the Doctor.
- the Doctor retorted.
- Alex requested but the Doctor lifted the things from the dinner table in front of
  them and threw them to Alex and Olivia.
- the Doctor wondered after checking his teeth then heading down the hall again, Alex
  behind them, but Olivia tugged on the Doctor's hand, making him stop to look at
  her with a frown.
- Olivia snapped.
- he questioned.
- Olivia asked as Alex watched the candles.
- Alex wondered.
- Olivia questioned.
- Olivia retorted.
- He took the scissors and used them to keep the creepy, giggling doll away from them.
- he shouted as Olivia found another door and opened it to shove Alex through.
- Alex questioned.
- Olivia replied, running up the stairs as Alex held some dolls at bay.
- the Doctor called as he came down the stairs the other way, using a mop to keep
  the dolls chasing him at bay.
- Olivia caught it and concentrated harder on her message.
- she urged, making him look around at them.
- he chanted, over and over, but the dolls continued toward George.
- George shouted, and Alex shoved the scissors at the Doctor before racing down the
  stairs, shoving past the dolls to get to George, scooping him up in his arms.
- The Doctor looked up at her as she stared at him, and he gave a frown of wonder
  when their gazes met, but she only shook her head as the front door opened.
- Claire called as she entered, and went into the kitchen, catching Olivia's and the
  Doctor's attention.
- Claire asked Alex with a frown of wonder.
- the Doctor grinned at George as Claire stepped next to the boy as well.
- George grinned, eating some toast.
- Claire wondered.
- Alex called, hurrying after them and making them stop to turn.
- the Doctor grinned, shaking his hand.
- Olivia wondered as they turned to head for the lift again.
- he retorted, making her giggle as they stepped into the lift and it started heading
  down.
- he asked in a soft voice.
- Olivia giggled as they all hurried through the door.
- the Doctor asked them all, making his way to the console where he and Olivia began
  working.
- she shot back.
- he murmured in her ear, making her look up at him with a smile.
- he smirked.
- He pointed to the screen.
- She was deep in thought when he suddenly swung his head over the edge of the frame
  to grin down at her and she jumped as she looked up at him.
- he asked.
- She grinned as she heard the heart beneath her cheek beat faster, lifting her hand
  to place it over his other heart to feel it beat just as quickly.
- enjoy!
- he finished, dipping Olivia back and making her giggle as he pulled her back up.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy asked from the doorway of the TARDIS, drawing their attention to her.
- the Doctor called as Olivia stopped next to him to press a kiss to his cheek before
  hurrying inside and looking around the control room.
- Amy called, heading back down the stairs with her phone.
- Olivia wondered, but before she could ask the Doctor or Rory, Amy pushed the Red
  Waterfall.
- Amy called as she stepped in, Olivia right next to her.
- Amy urged as Olivia pulled out her Sonic.
- Amy wondered, frowning up at her.
- Amy wondered.
- Her eyes shot open, her face reflecting panic.
- Amy wondered as Olivia sat back in the chair in shock.
- Olivia grinned as Amy looked up from her spot.
- the robot asked again.
- Rory called.
- Amy demanded in a low tone as Olivia only stared at the image.
- Rory questioned the Doctor.
- Amy snapped, standing to look into the glass.
- the Doctor screamed.
- Rory screamed as well.
- Amy explained.
- Rory asked the Doctor as the girls watched them.
- Rory shouted as he reentered the room.
- Rory asked.
- Amy snapped, tapping on the glass as he sat down.
- Amy wondered.
- She pressed a kiss to the tips of her fingers and pressed it to the glass, touching
  the image of the Doctor's lips.
- the Doctor grinned, pointing to the screens on the wall of the TARDIS and Rory turned
  to see them as well.
- So sterile and pristine it was unnatural to Olivia.
- Amy asked, looking around the ceiling.
- Olivia growled, grabbing Amy's arm and pulling her around the thing to find cover
  behind a huge bin.
- More Handbots appeared and started hobbling toward them.
- She aimed it at one of the Handbots and it sparked, shutting down but there were
  others still after them.
- They both bolted out from behind the cover and ran around what looked like an exhaust
  vent only to be stopped by more Handbots.
- Amy tried to climb up or find a way farther up, but Olivia kept her eyes on the
  Handbots which started searching with their hands again.
- Olivia wondered, neither one of them moving from their protected spot.
- They ran out from the underbelly of the facility and made sure they weren't being
  followed, ducking Handbots before they came to a room with seven doors and a short
  console with seven buttons.
- Amy called.
- The garden was full of trees and bushes in strange designs with an Ancient Rome
  feel to the architecture.
- Olivia called.
- They moved out from between them and the Handbot's hands touched each other, making
  their hands spark and they both shut down.
- Amy frowned in wonder.
- enjoy!
- Rory wondered.
- Rory sputtered.
- It fell back, dead and Olivia let go of Rory's arm to kneel next to it, pulling
  something from her one of her pockets.
- They stopped and bowed forward, knocked out.
- the Doctor wondered in astonishment.
- Rory wondered.
- the Doctor's voice rang in her head, making her freeze and stare wide eyes ahead
  at the door.
- Olivia shot back, marching toward her.
- Olivia asked.
- Rory wondered.
- Rory wondered as Olivia stood guard.
- he wondered, but she didn't look at him as she glanced around the garden.
- She turned to stop it but saw Amy out of the corner of her eye as she ran past her
  and sliced the head of it off with her sword before kneeling next to Rory.
- Amy snapped at him as she stood and Olivia helped Rory sit up.
- ! '''Doctor, we''re waiting'''
- Olivia snapped.
- Rory wondered, making Amy turn to him and Olivia.
- Rory shouted.
- she heard the Doctor in her mind.
- she asked.
- A moment later, Amy came back out, her eyes fixed on Rory.
- the Doctor snapped.
- Rory asked the Doctor.
- Olivia called.
- The girls stared at each other in shock.
- Rory suggested.
- the Amys asked.
- Olivia One shouted, as a group of Handbots hobbled toward them.
- They fought their way through the Handbots, but more only appeared.
- enjoy!
- Amy Two questioned as the pair of Amys, the pair of Olivias and Rory raced down
  the stairs of the facility.
- she thought with a grin.
- Amy One called.
- Amy Two questioned as they continued through the underbelly of the facility.
- Rory asked as Amy One stepped toward the console.
- Future Amy and Olivia went in fighting as Rory and the other girls ran around the
  Handbots as others dropped around them as their future selves cleared the way.
- Rory called when he and past Olivia and Amy were ahead.
- Rory hurried toward her and lifted her as Olivia Two used the dagger and her Sonic
  to take out the Handbots around them.
- Olivia One shouted at Amy One, shoving her out of the way to take the dart that
  had been shot at Amy in the neck.
- Amy shouted before slicing through the last Handbot with her sword then hurried
  toward Olivia as she sank to the floor, holding her neck.
- Olivia's head fell to the side as her eyes closed in death and Amy shoved her away
  as she scrambled to her feet and shot toward the TARDIS.
- Rory snapped.
- Rory argued.
- The telltale sound of the engines filled the control room as he and Rory stared
  at Amy, lying on one of the seats from the bottom of the stairs.
- Rory asked the Doctor, and Olivia looked to them from the console as he gave a smile.
- The Doctor stuck his tongue out at Amy, making her frown in wonder before giving
  a weak chuckle.
- Amy asked, making Rory look up at the Doctor but he turned and pulled Olivia with
  him deeper into the TARDIS.
- she murmured, wrapping her arms around him to run her fingers through his hair.
- She set her forehead against his as his thumbs stroked her cheeks.
- she asked.
- Olivia giggled, making the Doctor's frown deepen as he approached the console.
- he asked, making her gasp and switch the scanner off just as he stepped up behind
  her and she turned to him with wide eyes.
- she squeaked at the TARDIS before trying to move the scanner away but the Doctor
  wrapped his arms around her, over her arms to pin them to her sides as he looked
  at the screen.
- he wondered, frowning at the screen before looking down at Olivia as she looked
  to the console, fiddling with a switch in front of her while he still held her.
- he smirked before his hands came down to her stomach and ribs to tickle them, making
  her scream in delight and try to escape him, but he held her tightly.
- she laughed, before finally breaking free of his grasp and running around the console
  as Amy and Rory trotted down the stairs.
- Amy frowned in wonder, watching Olivia and the Doctor run around the console before
  stopping on either side and when the Doctor made for one side, Olivia moved in the
  opposite direction.
- Olivia giggled.
- Amy questioned, crossing her arms in front of her.
- Olivia grinned, wrapping an arm around Rory's arm as he escorted her down the stairs.
- Amy wondered, standing at the console as Olivia and the Doctor ran around it to
  fly the TARDIS.
- She went to the railing of a spiral staircase, along with an excited Doctor and
  a confused Amy and Rory.
- the Doctor grinned, making Olivia frown at him in confusion.
- Olivia wondered as he hurried toward her to take her hand and pull her along with
  him.
- Rory chirped as he and Amy followed the Doctor down the staircase.
- Amy wondered.
- Rory wondered as Olivia pulled another apple out of the bowl and tossed it to the
  Doctor who caught it, mid-air.
- Amy wondered.
- the Doctor called as the four flinched, but the three strangers didn't make a move
  against them.
- the woman in scrubs questioned.
- the Doctor said of the woman in scrubs.
- she asked again.
- Amy questioned Rory.
- Olivia shouted, silencing everyone before the woman in scrubs approached them.
- the young man called to her as she looked into each of their eyes.
- Amy snapped.
- Olivia asked, irritably as she placed her hands on her hips, making him look to
  her with wide eyes and sputter a moment as she stared at him expectantly, but he
  only turned to the three again.
- Rory wondered, pointing toward it.
- the Doctor asked.
- Howie wondered.
- Olivia wondered.
- he asked.
- Olivia wondered.
- enjoy!
- The Doctor led Olivia toward the man in a suit, tied to a chair amongst the dummies,
  whom they assumed was Joe.
- the Doctor wondered.
- the Doctor echoed.
- Olivia ground out, shutting the radio off again.
- the Doctor wondered.
- Howie pleaded.
- She ran toward him to stop him but he'd already turned the knob and the door opened
  to reveal a party held by a group of teenaged girls.
- another girl, still laughing.
- A loud roar sounded from down the hall, making everyone stare ahead, Joe squirming
  in his chair and panting, excitedly.
- Amy hoped as they all started backing away, slowly.
- She pressed her forehead to the door, shuddering in panic.
- It scared her more than anything, and she was bound to keep it from happening if
  she could.
- Her fingers brushed against it and she flipped the switch, the room immediately
  lighting up.
- Olivia screamed in terror.
- Olivia wondered as they headed back down the hall.
- Olivia asked, seeing Rory wheeling his limp body in the chair he'd been tied to.
- Amy asked, sitting next to her and she looked to her with a small smile and a nod.
- Amy frowned at him.
- Amy wondered as Olivia took a sip of her tea.
- Amy asked.
- It blasted to splinters and one of them came floating toward us, and we huddled
  against the wall…almost like we knew it was the end.
- Amy asked, rubbing her back, soothingly.
- Amy wondered.
- Rory couldn't help but ask.
- He smiled at her as she approached and she smiled in return, stepping next to him
  to let him wrap an arm around her waist, his other hand holding his tea.
- Rita wondered of Joe.
- the Doctor wondered in awe.
- Olivia asked, sipping at her tea.
- Olivia asked.
- the Doctor wondered.
- She leaned on the surface with her tea and he followed to lean next to her, mirroring
  her pose.
- he guessed, speaking softly as she stared at her tea and he watched her.
- The look on her face made him frown in concern and lift a hand to stroke her cheek.
- It made her want to hug him so tightly and kiss him so deeply to embarrass the group
  in the room but she somehow held herself back.
- he coaxed with a smile.
- Olivia breathed.
- Gibbis recalled as Howie slapped a hand over his mouth and stood from his chair.
- It silenced everyone and made them clap their hands over their ears as she cringed
  at the sound as well before lowering the Sonics and tossing the Doctor's back to
  him.
- Rita retorted.
- Olivia shot back, making the Doctor set a hand on her shoulder to calm her.
- Amy asked.
- Olivia asked, making him to turn to her.
- enjoy!
- Rory wondered.
- Amy called from the other side of the room and he and Olivia ran for the door.
- he growled.
- he snapped.
- It looked even uglier when there wasn't a door between it and her.
- Olivia guessed in, making him stare at the Minotaur in realization.
- the Doctor translated.
- Olivia snapped.
- the Doctor shouted, seeing the Minotaur swing at the glass he and Olivia were standing
  behind.
- Olivia shouted.
- The Doctor turned when he heard the door behind him open and shouted with a start
  when Amy and Rita hurried in before turning back to the Minotaur.
- Olivia called.
- the Doctor asked him.
- She followed him down the spiral stairs then down a hallway until he found something
  on the floor and sprawled out on the carpet to examine Howie's broken glasses.
- She shuddered before looking to the other end of the hall where Gibbis—who had been
  watching Howie when they tied him to the chair in reception—came, cautiously around
  the corner and Olivia stood, glaring at him.
- Tears fell from her eyes as he pulled her back toward the others, but she still
  struggled against his grip.
- Olivia sobbed, but when they reached the end of the hall he swung her in front of
  him, gripping both her arms to look her square in the face.
- he asked Rory.
- Rory wondered, making the couple frown.
- Someone behind the Doctor cleared their throat and he instantly pulled away from
  her with a smack, turning to Rita with a blush as Olivia supported herself in the
  corner, still dazed from his kiss.
- Rita asked, making Olivia frown.
- Rita asked.
- he replied before he slowed down and looked around.
- she called, trying to pull him away from room number 11.
- she asked, but he didn't stop pulling her along.
- They watched Rita stop in front of the door as the phone rang inside, then look
  to the camera before stepping in to answer it.
- They saw Gibbis on another monitor eating the fish that had been in the bowl Amy
  had carried from the spa before the Doctor shoved out of the chair and stomped out
  of the room, all of them hurrying after him.
- Rita's death had been the last straw.
- she asked.
- she echoed as he stood to pace the room.
- Rory wondered.
- enjoy!
- They turned corners and kept running until Olivia, who was holding the Doctor's
  hand stopped and turned to face the Minotaur as it rounded the corner behind them,
  instantly becoming mesmerized.
- the Doctor shouted trying to pull her away but she only stared at the beast coming
  for them.
- Amy shouted, opening the door of a room.
- Gibbis coward between the two beds to the side, Rory and Amy moved to barricade
  the door with their bodies, but Olivia screamed when met with the sight in the room,
  the Doctor staring on in shock and awe.
- The Doctor's last regeneration.
- the Doctor questioned, gripping one of her hands to keep her close, asking why his
  regeneration was in the room.
- Amy shouted as they heard pounding on the door.
- He had to lie.
- Why had she believed he would act otherwise?
- Rage suddenly took over her as she stood from Amy, marching toward the Doctor and
  without a word she slapped him, hard, with an open palm across the face.
- Rory called in shock and tried to head toward her to stop her but Amy gripped his
  arm to pull her back.
- He winced when the band smacked him in the forehead then rattled to the floor and
  he stared at her with wide eyes as she turned to walk away from him, stopping near
  Amy as she lifted a hand to wipe her face, still sobbing.
- Olivia called, her voice thick with emotion.
- He looked to Amy for guidance and she only nodded, permitting him to wrap his arms
  around her in return.
- Amy wondered.
- Amy wondered.
- He stared at her retreating back before turning to operate the console, the engines
  starting their familiar sound.
- The alternative was death, and though she didn't want him to die, it didn't make
  her like it any more.
- She tensed further when she heard his footsteps coming closer, then felt the bed
  sink at her knees.
- The Doctor gripped her wrist before she was out of reach, making her stop but she
  didn't look back at him.
- He led the way out the door and into a street, a red convertible sitting on the
  curb in front of them.
- Amy sniffled before they pulled away and she gave him a sad smile.
- Before she could think of flipping off the scanner he grabbed it and pulled toward
  him to see what she'd been looking at.
- He looked up when he heard her footsteps heading away and saw her heading up the
  stairs.
- She kept her eyes averted to his bowtie, noting that it was purple…and remembering
  she'd suggested he wear purple that morning.
- They pulled away with a smack, and the Doctor instantly bent down to scoop her up
  and carry her bridal style up the stairs, making her squeak in surprise and tighten
  her arms around his neck.
- Her hair was pulled up in a messy ponytail that was whipping around her head as
  she bobbed it to the beat, wearing nothing but one of the Doctor's shirts.
- she smiled, knowingly.
- he asked, looking to the stack of pancakes and she pulled back to grin at him.
- he grinned back, and as if on cue a timer sounded.
- He grabbed Olivia's hand and twirled her before continuing his dance and Olivia
  mirrored him.
- enjoy!
- he smiled, warmly, reaching a hand into his inside jacket pocket.
- she wondered, attempting to turn around but he pulled her back.
- The dog barked once before hurrying to the other side of the street and the Doctor
  led her forward again without a word.
- he grinned, looking around at the ties.
- The Doctor shouted in triumph when he found a green bowtie to match Olivia's new
  dress and flashed his Psychic Paper to the vendor before pulling off his red bowtie,
  tucking it into his pants pocket and tying the green one around his neck, using
  the mirror the cart provided.
- he asked, tucking his hands into his pockets as he sauntered toward her and her
  smile grew as she pulled her hands out behind her back, presenting a green fez to
  him.
- he smiled, pulling her closer.
- After all this time, after everything they'd been through, the starlight in her
  eyes was still there, and it was as bright as ever.
- he smirked, making her giggle and gently tap his chest.
- It made him smile, but when he changed the screen to what he'd been looking at before,
  his smile fell.
- That date on the screen was coming up soon for him, and he felt his hearts break
  over not only never having a chance to give Olivia the child she wanted—the child
  he wanted—but also putting her through his death…again.
- That thought made her pull back from him and look into his sea-green eyes in concern.
- They leaned their foreheads against the other's, still holding each other close.
- He'd always liked seeing her riled up, whether it was at him or something else.
- He held an arm out toward her and she slid hers around his to let him lead her to
  the door.
- She stood and stepped toward the door to open it, only to stare huge, green eyes
  ahead in shock at who was on the other side of the door.
- Aaron, Olivia and the Doctor all grinned before Olivia stepped forward and threw
  her arms around her mother.
- the Doctor asked before placing kisses to both her cheeks when Aaron let her go.
- Joyce blushed as the other three stared huge eyes a him in disbelief when he lifted
  his right and only hand (having lost his left hand when his Vortex Manipulator was
  stolen by River Song) to scratch at the back of his head, not saying a word.
- Olivia blurted, looking at her mother as she looked back at her.
- Olivia snapped, sending a glare up at Jack, as did Aaron.
- Aaron snapped as well, all ignoring or not noticing the Doctor heading toward him.
- Olivia shouted then gasped when the Doctor gave Jack a left hook, sending him to
  the floor.
- the Doctor nearly screamed, shaking the pain from his hand then cradling it as Olivia
  ran toward him.
- she groaned as Joyce followed her to help Jack sit up on the stairs, his nose gushing
  blood.
- Joyce shot at the Doctor, making Olivia look to her with wide eyes.
- Aaron shot back from the bottom of the stairs.
- Aaron snarled.
- Jack's eyes gleamed brighter as he lifted his hand and wrapped it around Aaron's
  waist to pull him a little closer while Olivia pressed the bundle of ice in a dish
  towel to the Doctor's hand.
- The sound of a camera shutter made Olivia look up at him just as he turned his phone
  around to show her the picture.
- Olivia ordered with a grin.
- Olivia breathed.
- Olivia snapped, standing tall and placing her hands on her hips as he looked up
  at her.
- he retorted.
- Aaron chimed in.
- Aaron asked the Doctor and Olivia.
- Joyce asked, bringing glasses for all of them and the bottle of wine Jack had brought.
- he wondered.
- Aaron wondered, taking a sip from a wine glass Joyce filled.
- the Doctor guessed, and Olivia nodded before giggling when he took a sip of wine
  and made a face.
- Aaron questioned again, irritably.
- she wondered, using her finger to gather the bits of frosting she missed.
- He hugged Aaron, then Joyce as Jack stood and pulled Olivia into a tight hug.
- Once he disappeared Olivia turned to the three and placed a hand on Aaron's and
  Jack's shoulders, her mother standing between them as Olivia glanced at each one.
- Jack asked again, causing her to meet his gaze.
- Joyce frowned in wonder.
- he asked, not looking from the console.
- enjoy!
- he smiled as they stopped at a door and Olivia frowned in wonder when she noticed
  the lights around them flicker.
- she wondered as he used the knocker on the door.
- Craig announced as he opened the door, then looked surprised as the couple smiled,
  brightly at him.
- Craig wondered, hugging her in return before stepping back.
- Olivia frowned at him in question as he let go of her hand and pulled his Sonic
  out of his jacket to scan the area at the bottom of the stairs.
- Craig warned as Olivia followed the Doctor up the stairs, Craig right behind her.
- Olivia asked, her eyes alight as she looked at Craig, asking permission to pick
  up the baby.
- She swallowed before looking to the baby as he started to fuss again, sensing her
  mood.
- Craig stared at the Doctor in awe as Olivia frowned in wonder, having never seen
  him do that before.
- Craig pleaded.
- Olivia frowned in wonder at Craig as she pulled a chair next to the baby to sit
  and play with him.
- she wondered with a smile.
- the Doctor smirked, as he set the book down.
- Olivia grinned as the Doctor leaned closer to Alfie when he made his baby noises.
- Craig wondered.
- Craig frowned.
- Craig echoed.
- Craig asked.
- Craig questioned, watching him carefully.
- she wondered with a smirk.
- Olivia urged as he stopped and turned to a flickering street light.
- He sighed through his nose before leaning toward her and planting his lips to hers
  in a hard kiss, pulling away with a smack.
- Olivia called, stepping up next to him to watch the helicopter start to wobble in
  the air.
- Olivia gasped when the helicopter landed behind Craig as he walked in pushing Alfie
  in his stroller, knocking something over behind him and catching his attention.
- she grinned as he approached.
- Craig wondered.
- Olivia called, making him frown as she knelt down.
- he suddenly asked, making Olivia frown at him in wonder as he stepped to the other
  side of the store, making she and Craig follow.
- Craig wondered.
- Craig questioned, following them.
- Craig wondered as they all stopped at a blocked off lift.
- he noticed as the Doctor and Olivia remained outside the lift.
- Craig shot back, stepping into the threshold to keep the door from sealing, and
  Alfie made a few noises from his stroller.
- Craig wondered.
- Craig frowned.
- Craig breathed in wide-eyed shock.
- she asked, glancing at the Doctor to see his progress.
- Craig demanded as Olivia pulled her hands down to reach into her jacket pocket for
  her own Sonic, the Doctor still trying to adjust his.
- he called.
- Craig shouted.
- the Doctor ordered, and they both aimed at the panel he was talking about, beams
  of light each coming from their Sonics and they were soon back in the lift before
  the thing that had been marching toward them could reach them.
- Craig screamed as Olivia leaned back against one of the walls with a sigh before
  they stepped out of the lift when it opened.
- Craig questioned, making them stop and Olivia glanced to the Doctor, who nodded.
- enjoy!
- Craig wondered.
- the Doctor echoed incredulously.
- Olivia grinned, waving to her as well, and Val waved back with a smile.
- he asked.
- Craig retorted.
- the Doctor grinned before hugging him.
- She tried to speak but found it impossible…as if her words had been stolen and she
  stared at him incredulously.
- the Doctor murmured.
- the Doctor grinned.
- Olivia asked Val as the Doctor slid out from under the table and handed a stuffed
  dog to Olivia he'd found under the table.
- I wanted to get one for my nephew, but stockroom say there's no such item.
- Val wondered, hearing the racks fall as they all whirled toward the scene.
- Olivia asked.
- They all trailed into the dressing room, slowing as they entered to see anything
  out of the ordinary.
- Craig asked the Doctor, while the Time Lord peeked into the curtained rooms.
- Olivia wondered, peeking into the room on her side.
- Olivia wondered.
- she grinned before a scream sounded from behind the curtain the Doctor looked behind.
- Craig asked them.
- the Doctor scolded as Alfie made little baby noises, catching the Doctor's attention.
- Craig pointed out as the Doctor pulled his Sonic out to scan the area.
- Olivia scolded, glaring at the Doctor and he patted Craig on the shoulder.
- Craig asked.
- Craig retorted.
- Craig snapped.
- They both straightened and frowned, looking confused, the Doctor panicking but Olivia
  looked around then smiled when she looked at the board next to them.
- Craig questioned, taking the thing to put it on.
- Craig wondered, struggling with the papoose.
- Olivia grinned bouncing Alfie on her arm.
- she smiled as the Doctor took Alfie, almost awkwardly.
- he wondered, adjusting Alfie in his arms as Olivia stepped toward Craig to help
  him with the papoose.
- he laughed.
- she snapped as Craig only stared huge eyes at the thing, his jaw nearly on the floor
  as he held tight to Alfie.
- Craig smiled.
- Olivia pulled her Sonic out to use it on the Cybermet as the Doctor held it in place
  to keep it from attacking.
- Olivia snapped.
- the Doctor chirped, grabbing Olivia's hand and dragging her after him, leaving Craig
  to struggle with the papoose and Alfie.
- Olivia stepped ahead of him when she noticed a torch on the floor and bent to pick
  it up, but stopped dead when she looked into the hall ahead of her.
- But instead of coming after her as she thought it would, it bent down and grabbed
  George, dragging him away and she turned to the unconscious Doctor.
- she hoped.
- Craig hoped.
- She stared at the Cybermat as it sat unmoving on the table before looking to the
  doorway where Craig stepped in.
- Alfie suddenly started crying from upstairs, making them freeze and look to each
  other.
- She quietly stood and followed the Doctor to the stairs, reaching the top just in
  time to see him peek into Alfie's room.
- Alfie was no longer crying, but now she was ready to burst into sobs at the thought
  of losing the Doctor…forever.
- It had been a dream, and now she knew it would stay, just that…a dream.
- She only smiled and stepped toward the two, but he frowned at her, seeing the tears
  in her eyes as she started playing with Alfie.
- He gave a sigh before leaning closer to Olivia to press a kiss to her head as she
  still played with Alfie.
- Olivia chuckled as Alfie made another noise.
- Olivia smirked, knowing exactly what he was talking about and feeling giddy when
  the Doctor blushed.
- Olivia warned when they stopped at the door, hearing its beeping coming closer.
- he realized, seeing his screwdriver lying on the floor on the other side of the
  door.
- Craig called from inside the house, making them both look inside to see him on the
  floor wrestling with the Cybermat.
- When the glass settled she hurried toward the door to look inside.
- Craig shouted, still wrestling with the Cybermat.
- Craig shouted, making the Doctor grab a saucepan from the kitchen table and slam
  it into the Cybermat.
- He kicked the Cybermat off the Doctor and slammed the tray down onto it, holding
  it down as best he could.
- Craig snapped as Olivia watched, clinging Alfie to her.
- Craig panted as well.
- Craig grinned, holding his arms up to take him and Olivia handed the baby over before
  turning to the Doctor and slapping him in the arm, one hand at a time.
- Olivia ground out between smacks.
- Craig frowned in wonder.
- She knew why he'd come after her.
- the Doctor echoed, unable to stifle his smirk.
- she complained, pulling her hand from his as she saw him trying not to laugh.
- she frowned in complete wonder and confusion.
- she frowned again.
- Craig yawned as he stepped into the room, holding Alfie and sat next to him on the
  sofa.
- Craig chuckled, incredulously.
- He gathered his things from the table and stepped around the couch to head out the
  door when he found Olivia standing there, eyes filled with tears.
- enjoy!
- They used the lift and when the Doctor came out, still gripping Olivia's hand, they
  were still in the mall, making the Doctor spin around in wonder in the middle of
  an aisle.
- Sometimes, she couldn't believe how he could run at the mouth the way he did.
- Val guessed.
- he hoped and she smiled before stepping closer and pressing her lips to his in a
  tender kiss.
- They climbed down until they found a huge ship in a cave, light flickering as if
  trying to get power.
- Olivia gasped when she heard the Doctor shout in pain, and almost launched around
  the corner but Craig grabbed her wrist to pull her back into their hiding place,
  peeking at the two Cybermen as one of them held the Doctor.
- She pointed her Sonic at them as Craig pointed the scanner at them, catching their
  attentions.
- the Doctor shouted in a scolding tone.
- she shot back.
- Olivia snapped.
- the Doctor shouted, struggling against his captor.
- the Doctor shouted.
- Olivia screamed, thrashing to be free of her captor as it dragged her next to the
  place where Craig was locked in.
- Craig shouted.
- Olivia screamed as she was shoved into the machine as well.
- Craig cried in pain as Olivia growled loudly in pain as well.
- Olivia cried.
- one of the Cybermen demanded.
- He grabbed his Sonic as Craig broke free completely and ran toward Olivia as she
  struggled in the machine that hadn't let her go.
- the Doctor assured her as he worked the Sonic over her bonds and the Cybermen around
  them held their heads.
- Craig questioned.
- They ran back the other way, dodging the exploding Cybermen around them as the Doctor
  still carried Olivia.
- A second later they were inside the lift, the doors opening with a ding and Craig
  ran out to look for Alfie, leaving the Doctor to carry Olivia out of the lift.
- Val questioned Craig as he ran toward her.
- the Doctor warned as she sauntered down the aisle and waved at him.
- She sank to the floor, instantly shuddering with sobs as she curled her legs up
  into her chest, resting her forehead on her knees and wrapping her arms around her
  legs.
- She could feel the weight of it on her shoulders and on her heart, and even as the
  tears flowed from her eyes and down her cheeks, she felt the weight getting heavier
  and heavier.
- He led her around the house to the back door to step in just in time to see Craig
  with Alfie in his papoose.
- Craig trailed off with a smile as he approached the couple, referring to the clean
  house around him.
- Craig wondered, touched by the gesture.
- Craig grinned as Olivia leaned over to play with Alfie's hand.
- Craig laughed, tapping the Doctor's arm as Olivia stood tall to stand next to the
  Doctor.
- the Doctor grinned, hugging Olivia close.
- Olivia giggled, making him look to her with a smile as he shut the fridge again.
- He held her there for a moment as she cried silently into his chest, one hand stroking
  her hair, the other soothingly stroking her back.
- She frowned at his back as she tried to keep up with his pace and when he pulled
  her inside, he let go of her hand and rushed toward the console to operate it.
- lol Enjoy!
- Just as she was about to head toward the door to try finding him, the TARDIS door
  opened and he grinned as he stepped in, still wearing the hat Craig had given him.
- he wondered, shutting the door behind him as she stared at the thing he was carrying.
- she questioned as he hurried toward her and placed a kiss on her cheek before heading
  to the console.
- she questioned, helping him fly the TARDIS.
- He pulled her closer by the waist as they reached a red-skinned man behind a chain-link
  window.
- the red-skinned man shot back.
- She hadn't seen him wield that much power without a word in a while.
- He set the bottle and glasses on the table as the Doctor and Olivia sat before he
  left.
- Olivia wondered, looking at the bottle.
- she frowned, stopping herself from pouring as she looked at him.
- Gideon asked.
- the captain inside asked.
- She gripped the railing as she watched them speak, trying not to fall over the rail
  as people around her shouted and shoved, ordering the queen be moved.
- the stranger asked.
- Gantok reminded them.
- the Doctor asked as they entered, stepping away from Olivia's grip to examine on
  of them.
- Dorium sneezed, making the Doctor jump and look to Olivia before looking back at
  him as she only stared at the head with huge eyes, Gantok placing the torch on a
  holder in the wall behind her.
- Gantok released Olivia as he fell, and she grabbed onto the edge of the stone, dangling
  over the live skulls below.
- She flopped onto her back panting tiredly, then coughing at the dust she kicked
  up around her as the Doctor knelt down next to her.
- he hoped and she could only nod through a few coughs, making him grin as he gripped
  her hand and pulled her to her feet.
- Realizing the punch line of the joke the couple began chuckling as well.
- Dorium sighed as the Doctor stepped closer to his box.
- he asked.
- the Doctor questioned.
- He knocked on the door and she ran toward it, opening it to let him in.
- Dorium called from inside the box.
- Olivia gaped, watching him hurry up the stairs and set the box in one of the jump
  seats, roughly.
- She hugged his arm as he stared at the scanner, not knowing what else to do to comfort
  him.
- She watched him swallow and frowned in wonder before he pulled away from her grasp,
  running around the console to operate it.
- the Doctor growled, just as irritated as she was with Dorium and she obeyed…only
  to find him sitting upside down.
- the Doctor shot back.
- he snapped.
- She didn't have to hear any more as he closed his eyes, obviously pained by the
  news, and she knew it must have been a friend of his.
- Dorium asked, seeing the look on his face as well.
- She tried swallowing the lump in her throat as the Doctor wrapped his arms tightly
  around her, setting his face in the crook of her neck as she hugged him tightly
  in return.
- She only allowed one to escape down her cheek as she spoke to the Teselecta captain
  inside.
- she smirked.
- She took her step back and smirked at the Gideon-bot.
- He didn't want her to feel alone, and after this, she would feel that way…at least
  for a few hours.
- Rory wondered.
- Amy wondered as they all sipped at theirs.
- she chirped, making him frown at her from his reclined position.
- She was pregnant.
- Amy muttered.
- Rory wondered and when she looked at him she shook her head, taking a sip of her
  wine.
- she wondered.
- He knew they'd sort it.
- This Olivia in her timestream was so happy, and it made him hate what was coming
  even more.
- Her grip tightened on his hands and he felt her find their telepathic bond.
- Canton Everett Delaware III.
- Amy questioned the Doctor.
- Olivia trailed off as they all stared at the astronaut standing in the knee deep
  water at the shoreline of the lake.
- He frowned then opened one eye to peek at her before looking around in wonder, realizing
  he wasn't dead.
- he questioned in a high-pitched tone.
- enjoy!
- he asked the Silurian, making the servant girl pause as she stood tall next to Churchill.
- the servant girl asked.
- It had always been that way and she could never understand why.
- As if sensing her thoughts he looked up at her and she felt her heart skip in some
  familiar emotion she couldn't quite place.
- Churchill wondered, making Olivia glance at him before staring at the raggedy prisoner.
- she asked in astonishment.
- Churchill asked, making her heart skip as she looked away in embarrassment.
- Olivia suddenly found herself hand in hand with the soothsayer, Churchill following
  and she frowned in wonder at memories that she didn't remember having before about
  being with him in his travels.
- the Doctor wondered.
- Churchill asked.
- Churchill wondered as Olivia took her place closer to the Doctor, letting him sling
  an arm over her shoulders as she hugged his chest.
- Churchill questioned.
- Churchill echoed as Olivia frowned up at him.
- She had most definitely felt fear, she was sure of that.
- Churchill questioned in a whisper as well.
- They all slowly looked up to see the Silence creatures dangling from the ceiling
  like bats in a cave, staring down at the three.
- The smoke bomb went off with a bang that was followed by shouting from men with
  guns in fatigues.
- Just as Olivia went to lunge for Amy, two men on either side grabbed both her arms
  to hold her back, but she still roared at the ginger.
- A blurry image of red hair and a black suit greeted him before it came into focus
  and he recognized the face.
- a soothing, familiar voice asked to his left, and he looked to Olivia's worried
  gaze as she stroked his hairline.
- Olivia advised as he pulled himself up on the couch he was lying on.
- Amy smirked and nodded to the far wall when he looked up at her and he spun around
  to look at all the drawings pinned to it…drawings of their adventures.
- He hugged her tightly as her arms wrapped just as tightly around his neck, her face
  buried in his shoulder.
- Olivia wondered, sitting on the edge of the desk as the Doctor stepped closer.
- Amy grinned, coming out from behind her desk to run toward him and hug him tightly.
- Amy demanded, but Olivia took the sketch and set it back on the table before stepping
  in front of her.
- Amy wondered.
- But barely anybody believes such stories now…
- Kafyip sighed but followed.
- The Doctor rushed in.
- He had been wounded on his sword.
- he cried, pulling the dematerialisation lever and sending the TARDIS on another
  journey.
- He hit a lever and the TARDIS shot through the last few thousand kilometres of its
  journey.
- said Guhi, as he walked out, the Sycorax following.
- But the spiders were quite close.
- said a voice behind him.
- The two figures lay on the floor with a large pool of blood forming around them
  as Kafyip pulled the box free.
- Guhi Stab-Hand was dead!
- If all goes well I might write some more poetry but I'm still unsure.
- And he admitted it wasn't the most adult of responses.
- Worse, he was in the middle of a regeneration crisis, not yet settled into his new
  body.
- Better to be uncouth than unconscious.
- Granted, he shouldn't have held it off so long, He knew his body was dying, but
  he'd practically burned all his cells out before he let himself succumb.
- Not as this him.
- Despite everything he'd put them through, despite having no good solutions, they'd
  managed to make good lives for themselves.
- Making do.
- Make the best life with what they have?
- Just enough to allow her to choose how she'll spend her days, what she'll do.
- It might take longer to learn herself, but nothing would stop his Donna.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who.
- Tell me whatcha think!
- She didn't care what she looked like, only how he was going to answer her.
- He just had to say it.
- He was gone, and he was never coming back.
- How could she not be smitten?
- she looped her arm through his, resting her head on his shoulder, blissfully happy.
- Everything had its time, the Doctor had told her that himself.
- The thought gave her butterflies.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who.
- Tell me whatcha think!
- there should be about 6 more chapters.
- This was all her life came down to, meaningless tasks on a monotonous day.
- Her answers were clipped and short and she never took her eyes off the window.
- she sighed.
- Her eyes, no longer filled with the life and vigor they once held, were solemn.
- Her brash demeanor softened.
- Her voice was soft, almost pleading.
- Jackie asked, hopeful.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who and move on.
- Tell me whatcha think!
- there should be about 6 more chapters.
- When her mother suggested she find something to do, this was not what she had expected.
- Rose sighed and took a deep breath.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who and move on.
- Tell me whatcha think!
- there should be about 6 more chapters.
- Rose has been a field agent for almost two years now, and a part of Torchwood for
  almost three.
- Rose knew all there was to know about every department, and even worked in most
  of them, but it was Mickey who convinced her to become a field agent.
- Plus, she had been the front receptionist for a while now, it WAS getting a little...well,
  boring.
- Rose finally caved in.
- he left, an extra spring in his step.
- It didn't fill the hole she felt in her heart, but it was pretty darn close.
- She flipped the light switch and jumped, finding herself face to face with a large
  group of her co-workers in party hats.
- She flushed with embarrassment.
- His curly ginger locks hung low over his blue eyes.
- She was gorgeous, all blonde hair and brown eyes, and he quickly took the risk of
  asking her out.
- What mattered now was that they give Rose the best birthday of her life.
- Roady came up behind her, leaning against the table to face her.
- It was a statement, not a question.
- She sipped her drink.
- She should be happy, but she wasn't, not completely/.
- she picked at her fingernails nervously.
- Roady was not going to let him spoil this night.
- It wasn't a compliment.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who and move on.
- Tell me whatcha think!
- Not sure how many more chapters there will be, but i promise it will be worth the
  read.
- Rose screeched at her stepfather, furious.
- Pete Tyler looked out into the crowd embarrassed, as some of the party-goers were
  now glancing in their direction.
- Rose's eyes widened in even more disbelief.
- Rose crossed her arms not budging.
- Roady suggested from behind.
- she accused, spinning to face her friend.
- Rose joined the later.
- He bellowed out a laugh.
- Martha Jones, one of Torchwood's promising young scientists asked.
- This caused an eruption of laughter from everyone at the table, and a glare from
  Jackson.
- he scowled at his field partner.
- Roady stuck his tongue out at Rose, who returned the gesture whilst laughing.
- Martha looked at her like it should have been obvious.
- Roady called, following after her.
- Martha asked innocently.
- Pete tried to get a word in, watching her as she paced back and forth.
- she yelled, spiting out his title.
- She obediently sat in one of the plastic patio chairs.
- Pete nodded.
- If a date or a year seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness
  of Doctor Who and move on.
- Tell me what you think!
- Not sure how many more chapters there will be, but i promise it will be worth the
  read.
- (Or in his case, a lot nervous).
- He just had to make sure every little detail went according to plan, especially
  since Director Tyler himself would be standing over his shoulder the whole time.
- Jackie pulled Rose into a strong embrace, hearing Martha's cue for her to leave.
- she whispered, her voice tight with emotion.
- Rose knelt down to face her two year old brother Tony, who also wrapped her in a
  hug.
- His strawberry blonde hair poked out from underneath his small baseball cap she
  had given him for his birthday.
- He nodded his head vigorously.
- She began to leave, then turned back at the last minute.
- Deep in her heart she knew it was a lost cause, but she still had to try.
- She left the room, leaving Rose alone with the dimension cannon and the others behind
  the control room glass.
- She pulled the lid off the box, revealing the dark purple jacket inside.
- Roady asked.
- They both knew the cannon wasn't guaranteed to get her to the parallel earth, especially
  on the first try, but Rose was determined.
- But she had to do it.
- Caroline.
- she smiled encouragingly at Rose, who now looked a little nervous.
- Rose said anxiously.
- The dimension cannon staff were preparing for the biggest jump they had attempted
  yet.
- As the light dimmed and they looked back up, Rose had vanished.
- Suddenly, a small blue dot began flashing on the screen.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- Tell me what you think!
- Not sure how many more chapters there will be, but i promise it will be worth the
  read.
- she mused.
- He was alert, full on Director mode.
- he hung up the phone, then swung his legs over the side of the four-poster bed and
  hurriedly began dressing.
- he replied, swiftly tying his tie.
- Caroline shook Pete's hand, motioning him into the dimension cannon control room.
- Caroline frowned.
- He swiveled a monitor around to show Pete.
- This was very bad.
- Caroline shook his head.
- He decided to skip the details and get straight to the pressing problem at hand.
- If something seems off, just blame it on the wibly-wobly-timey-wimey-ness of Doctor
  Who and move on.
- Not sure how many more chapters there will be, but i promise it will be worth the
  read.
- The had just finished their usual Sunday morning run, and were now enjoying a nice
  cup of coffee.
- Roady snorted.
- Rose narrowed her eyes at him.
- he sat back down in in a huff breathing heavily, his breath all that could be heard
  down the silent street.
- He let his hands, and his heart, drop.
- he stood and walked away from the one he used to call friend, heading back home
  alone.
- she called after him, but he didn't turn around.
- he sneered the name.
- She was once again all alone.
- At least, that's what I do :)
- Rose and The Doctor forever!
- He was frustrated because just moments ago, some intern stopped by his table to
  tell him Rose was not going to be able to make it to lunch...again.
- That probably wasn't going to happen any time soon.
- Roady just scowled deeper into his cup.
- Roady shrugged halfheartedly.
- ! '''S a woman, isn''t it?'
- he left Mickey and Roady alone at the table as he cleared his lunch and rushed back
  to work.
- he mumbled.
- Mickey pushed his chair in and left, leaving Roady alone with his thoughts.
- He knew it was hopeless with Rose, but that 'pep' talk hadn't made him feel any
  better.
- And yes, I totally put Jake Simmonds and Toshiko Sato as a couple ;) you're welcome.
- At least, that's what I do :)
- Rose and The Doctor OTP forever!
- he turned his attention to Martha who was rapidly pressing buttons.
- She was nervous, anxious and excited, all at the same time.
- No turning back now.
- She could just make out one word...Doctor.
- The woman became somber.
- but Rose wasn't really listening her, only the pounding ringing in her ears.
- The woman tried to be comforting.
- Rose spun around to face her, taking in every inch of the woman.
- Rose asked.
- Rose decided it would be best to keep her identity a secret, just in case.
- Rose was going to have to fix it, she knew, and it would involve whatever the hell
  that thing on Donna's back was.
- Rose tried to play it off as nothing, but she was drawn to it.
- Everyone in the control room looked up in anticipation.
- Martha asked the question everyone was thinking.
- She reasoned.
- Now she was getting somewhere.
- At least, that's what I do :)
- Rose and The Doctor OTP forever!
- Good, she had traveled backwards, not forwards.
- She had gotten in touch with this world's UNIT and gathered information all about
  her.
- Rose deflected the question.
- she hissed.
- Donna shook her head.
- Donna's eyes widened with surprise, then narrowed again in suspicion.
- At least, that's what I do :)
- From her location on the side walk, Rose could see the blinkers of Donna's car change
  as she turned left.
- They would all be gone any minute now, as would she, thanks to Donna Noble, the
  most important woman in the whole of creation.
- Then she whispered the two words that had changed her entire life, the words that
  had led her to The Doctor, her Doctor; Bad Wolf.
- The Doctor would be alive and Rose would be on her way back to him.
- That's what I do :)
- Jackie scoffed ungratefully.
- They both entered the lift, slowly ridding down the bottom floors.
- Rose stated matter-of-factly, growing more irritated by the minute.
- She rose from her seat.
- Martha pleaded.
- Jackie sat next to the young scientist.
- Martha didn't make eye contact.
- she called.
- Martha sighed in relief.
- Once she was in the hallway, she whipped out her mobile and pressed speed dial number
  three.
- She was going to find Rose, help in any way she could, and give The Doctor a good
  slapping or two when she saw him.
- That's what I do :)
- How on earth was she going to find him now?
- It was Harriet Jones, former prime minister.
- Rose rolled her eyes.
- Rose was so excited to see them both.
- Rose grew hopeful.
- Suddenly, a dark skinned woman in all black appeared on the screen.
- the woman asked.
- Rose wished they could hear her.
- Martha Jones, who was the exact double of the Martha that Rose knew in the parallel
  world, said.
- Rose mumbled, just a bit jealous.
- Sylvia soon joined them; all franticly trying to phone The Doctor.
- Rose's heart flipped at the sight of the man she had travelled so long and far to
  find.
- Sarah Jane cut in, as everyone began talking at once.
- Rose would have laughed if she wasn't so sad.
- The Doctor nodded.
- Maybe she could try her teleport jumper.
- Wilf chimed in.
- She pressed down hard, feeling energy pulse around her as she was transported through
  space.
- She had found him at last.
:solitary:
- R&R
- ! 'Disclaimer: All rights go to BBC'
- The Black Guardian leaned back in his chair and smiled grimly.
- He reached and shifted a piece on the board and the White Guardian's eyes narrowed
  in thought.
- The smile fell from his face and his dark eyes snapped in anger.
- He sent his ship spinning through the void, seeding it in his wake with snap-mines,
  Möbius barriers, and various other goodies.
- The Doctor ran into the console room to see Rose and Susan at the controls.
- So she typed out her first chat message.
- The Doctor grimaced.
- He'd been careful not to cluster anything too tightly, as he didn't want Susan to
  be hurt; but he had to get them to stop soon, or they'd be too close when he set
  off the Lens.
- The implosion was immediate and spectacular.
- ! 'Möbius Loop Five: Dolce Nocturum'
- For nearly a full day the battle raged green and silver and silent, until there
  was no more green, and the moon was grey with puddles and pools of silver beetles
  stretched as far as the eye could see.
- At length, the swarm rose, in countless trillions, and headed lazily towards the
  next moon.
- Of the first moon, there was nothing left, not even a pebble the size of a pea.
- ! 'Time of Takeover: 24 hours'
- The group of them ran for the bridge and the now familiar sensation of being sucked
  through a pipe came over him.
- The Revolution was on the move.
- She was encased in the snow and she had no idea how far away the surface was.
- He was freezing.
- He was alone in a wasteland of ice and snow.
- She took a breath, forcing herself to be calm and reached out to her husband, their
  link humming between them.
- /Koschei?/ she called.
- /Where are you?/ he asked.
- /A tiny narrow ledge over a precipice./
- /Hold on, love, I'm on my way,/ he sent back.
- /I'll hurry!/
- Diana-37 nodded and crossed her arms, waiting.
- He scrambled across the ice and onto the snowy ground, wondering how he was going
  to get them all out of this one.
- Susan's TARDIS lay in its crater, the systems down, it's corridors silent, dark,
  and cold.
- In the lab, fifteen tiny Time Lord Infants, too young to survive on their own, began
  to go into cardiac distress as the machines that kept them alive had stilled.
- Automatic systems tried to come on-line, but the TARDIS was too badly damaged, despite
  her best efforts.
- Alarms wailed in the medi-bay and K-9 roused from his recharging phase and lifted
  his head, ears swivelling as he went into action.
- He ran for the lab, to save the babies.
- Hope.
- Susan looked up at Koschei and he stood there a long moment, looking down the cliff
  face at her, his mind stuttering, as he tried to think through his desperation and
  panic.
- /Hold on, my love, I may have to build a Drone from parts here./ he told her and
  her laughter bubbled in his mind.
- It was a withered arm, sticking up through the snow, hands still curled, as though
  it was reaching for her.
- The Efapan snorted and shook its shaggy head and she clicked her tongue to get it
  to move forwards.
- The Doctor topped a rise and looked down into a field of snow and saw his wife,
  tiptoeing through it.
- /Rose?/ he sent and her head came up instantly.
- /Doctor!/ she cried and he ran forwards, slipping and tumbling down the slope and
  fetching up on the bottom with a small lump on his head.
- /I've got it,/ he told her finally and she sent him a kiss on the wind.
- /I never doubted,/ she assured him and he smiled.
- Sky-52 and London-11 were circling it, while the rest of the sisters were keeping
  it penned in the area, using spears and swords to prevent it from escaping.
- Madison-17 charged in, waving the battle-axe she'd taken off of that tribal chieftain,
  and with a deadly swing, she neatly decapitated the beast.
- The sisters and Jake all ran back away as the giant lizard began to thrash and scream
  for long moments before it finally died.
- It occurred to Adie, suddenly, that the other Time Lords might be able to hear her
- Koschei and Susan replied instantly, very much relieved.
- The Doctor and Rose replied as well, their minds both filled with the cold and the
  distress they were feeling from all of the dead bodies.
- / No one should have to endure this,/ the Doctor sent back, his mind filled with
  sorrow.
- /I know,/ she whispered.
- The ice floe crashed into the rock and shattered and he was trying to swim against
  the terrible strength of the river, being tossed about like a leaf, until he was
  flung out into the void, and found himself falling, with a vast weight of water
  coming down on top of him.
- As he lay panting he realized that he could dimly sense his other self in the area,
  which meant that it was likely Susan was around somewhere, and that put her in the
  blast radius.
- She pulled a barrel into the shelter and cut the top off, and lit it.
- One of the things Adie had found, while searching through the wreckage, was a portable
  player and a battery with enough charge to run it.
- Diana-37 stood over the body of the fallen warrior; his spear still clutched in
  her hand, and looked around at the other warriors of the tribe.
- ! 'Möbius Loop Seven: USG Cassiopeia'
- Then the wasps came.
- ! 'Time of Takeover: 20 hours'
- /We were already on our way there,/ he told her and Susan reached out and squeezed
  his hand before releasing it.
- It fell over slowly, it's vast bulk collapsing, like a building coming down.
- If nothing else came out of the Revolution, just getting to meet and become friends
  with all her sisters was still worth everything they were slogging through.
- She looked around at the twelve they'd gotten together so far and felt a warm glow
  in her hearts.
- She had family.
- The inside of the drone was, marginally, warmer than the outside.
- Adie turned off the disk.
- /Uncle… I believe I have found out why the Master cut off this series of loops./
- /You dated the Rani?/
- /Absolute nadir of my existence, she dumped me for Koschei, and then dumped him
  for science./
- /Did she try out the drugged lipstick on you?/
- /Where else would you keep something stupidly dangerous except for a sealed bundle
  of Time,/ he agreed.
- /So, what are we up against here?/ he asked, his mind sharp and hard.
- /Oh well, the Rani, she always did love a survivor,/ he sighed.
- /Adie, you just said they could hear telepathy, right?/
- /Which I can totally watch in the middle of a howling blizzard!/ he snarked back.
- /Don't tease,/ he chuckled and then withdrew from the conversation.
- He hadn't counted on the submerged bits of bodies and wreckage though and it was
  less of a slalom and more of roller-coaster before they finally skidded to a stop.
- They'd made it.
- Susan patted the Drone gently as they stepped out of the doorway.
- Adie appeared at one end of the downed shuttle, wearing some sort of old greyish
  uniform, that was ridiculously large on her, as she wasn't much bigger than Susan.
- Rose raced into the shelter, stomping her feet and warming her hands over the flaming
  barrel.
- Koschei and Susan both looked up and watched them, alerted by something in his demeanour.
- Adie looked at the ground.
- She was silent for a while.
- Family was nice, but sometimes privacy was needed.
- He looked at the readouts and his hearts sank like stones.
- ! 'Möbius Loop Six: Kalium Four'
- ! 'The swarm settled into orbit around Kalium Four: and the Rath rose to meet them.'
- ! 'Time of Takeover: 10 hours'
- /What do we do?/ Adie asked, suddenly feeling very small and frightened.
- She was standing in the shelter with Rose, Susan, and Koschei, but she was also
  with the Doctor, perched on the tower, staring up into the sky.
- The Doctor froze and severed the gestalt link in a hurry.
- The Doctor waited until it was good and gone, nowhere in sight, nothing at all in
  sight but snow, before unshielding and resuming the connection.
- /Bugger, one was just in front of me, but it left,/ he sighed out.
- The Doctor carefully climbed down the antenna, and then headed towards the ship.
- Half a mile seemed near, until you were walking into the teeth of a howling blizzard.
- The Doctor got the door free at last, popped it open, and looked inside.
- /I'm on my way,/ he replied.
- He got them all inside, shut the door, and turned the wheel.
- Tamara-61 ducked down as the rockets rained down around them.
- Then she opened a door and instantly shouted back to Susan.
- Adie was grinning when she got there.
- Adie nodded and went off to continue her explorations.
- Night had fallen and they were all exhausted.
- After a few minutes, the nest of blankets and mattresses became quite cosy and they
  all fell asleep.
- A shadow in the greyness caught his eye and he spun, throwing himself backwards.
- He had been trying to keep a low profile, but that was blown now.
- She was looking up at him, her conflicted emotions warring through her.
- But everything was spinning, the walls and the floor, and even his blaster, inexplicably
  dropped to the ground, spinning around in circles… his eyes flickered closed.
- Susan and Koschei both stumbled as the pain from the Master flooded them.
- He had to get moving before the scattered insects could congregate again and remember
  to come after him.
- Fighting to stay conscious, he searched desperately for the fallen weapon, the cold
  of the wall seeping in through the layers of his clothes and the exposed skin on
  his face burning from the bite of the frozen air.
- The snow was whipping around her, she could barely see at all, but the slender golden
  cord remained steady and she followed it blindly.
- Something caught her eye and she turned, feeling something sluggishly stirring in
  her mind.
- The Master had the blaster in his hand; he realized that he must have picked it
  back up, and he pointed it at the apparition in the snow.
- There were hands on him, turning him over, and then Susan's face came into view,
  looking down at him, her eyes filled with tears and her face pale.
- They reached the TARDIS, which was lying on it's side, and Susan lowered him gently
  to the ground.
- There was the sound of gunfire and flashes of light, but they didn't last long.
- There was no more.
- Adie looked very awkward as she switched off the player.
- They all looked at each other and wondered what it must have been like for some
  lowly engineering tech to keep that secret, even when death finally came for them
  all.
- The sound of choppers behind them made them speed up.
- Diana-37 soon discovered that swamps smelled even worse after they'd been carpet
  bombed and set on fire.
- On her TARDIS, Susan stared at the mess of wires and burned components with a sigh.
- Koschei settled against the bulkhead of the downed hospital ship and closed his
  eyes.
- /All right, love, I'm here, / he told her and slipped into gestalt with her.
- Susan crawled under the console, Koschei's mind nestled against hers, with him watching
  through her eyes, helping her the best he could, and K-9 cheerfully gave her suggestions
  and ran the diagnostic tests for her, but it was still frustrating.
- Then there was the Master's mental state.
- /He's a wreck,/Koschei agreed and she sighed.
- /He thought he was having a psychotic break,/ she told him.
- An alarm went off and she slid out from under the console quickly, the Master was
  waking up.
- The Master became aware of his surroundings slowly.
- Koschei, still closely linked to her, added his own strength to hers, his mind filled
  with his appalled compassion.
- /He's in pieces,/ Koschei murmured in her mind and she couldn't fault his analysis.
- Arse, he cursed silently at himself.
- She tugged his shirt and looked up at him with a melting gaze.
- He stared at her, searching her eyes.
- Her words were cut off by his kiss and she melted against him.
- He had a moment of concern, about how the other him would feel about this, but it
  was washed away in the flood of need, of love, and the feeling of coming home to
  a safe harbour, that she always evoked in him.
- Zoi-29 snapped the grid together and slotted the last circuit into place with a
  grimace.
- Koschei raised an eyebrow at her, his face unhappy.
- ! 'Möbius Loop Four: Abandoned Dalek Cruiser'
- Those Dalek weapons that they had been able to bring online and fire, tore gaping
  holes in the endless clouds, but they just kept coming.
- Then the locusts came.
- On the other side, in normal space, a tiny point of light formed, glowing faintly,
  and rapidly began to grow.
- ! 'Time of Takeover: Two Hours'
- She was right where she belonged, next to the Doctor.
- Shevia-48 and Madison-17 were using the whetstone to sharpen their blades, bonding
  over their shared love of bladed weapons.
- He was her world and without him, there'd be nothing.
- Koschei followed the Doctor and Rose, his face abstracted, and Adie paused to glance
  at him.
- She sat right next to him, and rested her head on his shoulder.
- Adie looked very surprised.
- Adie stood there, looking startled and a bit scared, which puzzled him, the Doctor
  was hardly a threat to her, nor was Rose.
- Now, if only his wife was here, everything would be good.
- The Doctor chuckled, a low throaty sound of enjoyment.
- Maybe, they weren't scared of him, but for him?
- Leia-76 was chewing on a pencil end, as Zoi-29 worked through the schematics.
- They looked at each other and burst into giggles, amused by their unrealistic dreams.
- She opened her eyes and looked at the deep circles under the Master's eyes, the
  lines of pain etched into his face, and felt an aching tenderness inside that drove
  her to care for him, to love and tend to him, but the conflicted feelings in Koschei
  made her wince as well.
- /What's wrong?/ Koschei's mind touched hers as he picked up her conflict and distress.
- /I don't know how this is going to work,/ she admitted.
- /However you want it to, wife,/ he replied, his mental voice very gentle.
- /We can give him the chestnut bureau, and the middle drawer in the bathroom!/ she
  decided and Koschei laughed.
- /We'll talk to him about what he wants, Susan, going slowly, as he's very badly
  hurt, okay?/ Koschei replied and Susan chuckled softly, breathing easier now.
- There was a jolt under her feet, a sensation of movement and the hill upon which
  they were walking suddenly sprouted a head and was now looking at them rather quizzically,
  its long antennae rising some thirty feet into the air.
- The Doctor fiddled with his sonic sent a quick burst of EMP out at the giant metal
  insect they were standing on.
- The Wasps shifted into formation and Rose glanced back.
- Blackness overcame her.
- The Doctor raced towards where an Ant the size of a pony had impaled Rose, his hearts
  pounding madly from sheer terror.
- The Doctor ignored everything; his only concern was Rose, his only thought to get
  her to safety, to make sure she was alive.
- He could not lose her, not after everything they had gone through.
- The Doctor didn't spare the breath to answer; he just kept running while Koschei
  kept disrupting the bugs around them.
- He reached the TARDIS, which sat there looking like a large boulder on the snowy
  plain, and leaned his forehead against the door.
- He recited the string of numbers and letters to her and she tapped it into the door
  lock.
- There was a long moment, as the TARDIS considered, and then the door opened and
  he shoved into it, looking around wildly.
- The Doctor raced after Adie, pounding down the darkened corridors with no thought
  to spare on anything but Rose.
- Adie looked at the scanner with a pale face.
- He climbed out of the trapdoor, filthy and covered in soot and ash, brushing futilely
  at his clothes and shaking his hair out.
- Koschei stroked the console softly, remembering all the things he'd done in this
  TARDIS and then looked around, thinking about what he needed to be fixed once the
  architectural reconfiguration system was up and working again.
- If there was anyone in the universe who could understand what the Master had lost
  after all, it was Koschei, who had gone through it too.
- He hit the intercom.
- He leaned down and kissed her brow and then just held onto Rose's hand and prayed
  to every power he could think of, hoping that at least one of them was listening.
- Koschei upgraded Adie's permissions to full co-pilot, so she'd have access to everything,
  and then called down to engineering.
- Adie began her chores rather sadly.
- It was a bit amazing, really, the number of assumptions which had somehow crept
  into her life, things she had never looked at or thought about until the present
  circumstances had required her to do so.
- But, for a hundred years, this ship had been the closest thing she had had to a
  friend, the only thing to possess anything resembling a presence or intelligence
  in what had amounted to enforced solitary confinement; the thing that had kept her
  from going quite mad.
- As for the Master...
- He was already moving, throwing on another jumpsuit from the medi-bay's locker.
- The sound of a TARDIS re-materializing split the air and she ran for the door.
- The Master put an arm around his shoulder and the Doctor turned and buried his face
  in his shirt, shoulders shaking.
- The Master turned that thought over in his head, trying it on for size and then
  nodded again, this time thoughtfully.
- The five women looked at each other and their smiles in the pre-dawn light were
  fierce and terrifying.
- In absolute silence, they sneaked into the camp.
- When they were done, not a single hunter was still alive and six Mashas returned
  to the base camp.
- He stood and edged forward, towards the dark hulking machinery, following the flickering
  light, and then bent over to peer into a crystalline tube.
- /The Master is on his way!/ she sent back.
- The sound of running feet answered him and Adie came in, sprinting up from the bowels
  of engineering, where she had been working.
- They worked in silence, just the sound of their breathing and the slap of shoes
  on the decking breaking into the rising beep of the alarms.
- Koschei pulled open the first one to be finished and lifted the girl out, setting
  her on the floor.
- He waved a hand in the air absent-mindedly, checking over the other containers.
- Koschei set the girl inside of the device, gently folding her arms over her chest
  and brushing the hair from her eyes.
- Koschei blinked.
- She held up a hand.
- He snorted, suddenly rather amused at the mental picture that evoked.
- Tomoko stood quietly, mulling that over for a long moment and then nodded at some
  notion in her head.
- He sighed and shrugged, looking resigned and very tired.
- He was silent for a while.
- /Susan will go spare if they hurt you, that's all I'm saying, / Koschei sighed out.
- The Master snorted from the other room.
- She took the tablet and scanned through it rapidly.
- Tomoko was silent for a while, considering this.
- Koschei shrugged, letting the fact that she'd nicked it pass, and looked at the
  Master.
- The Master was silent for a while.
- He was silent for a long while, working on the console with Koschei.
- Sophie-24 raised an eyebrow at her and Diana-37 nodded back, glad she wasn't the
  only one who had noted the problem.
- Susan grabbed her winter coat and ran for the Master's TARDIS, very much worried
  about the Master's safety where the Mashas were concerned.
- The Master didn't say anything, but she saw him nudge Koschei.
- Susan's felt a frisson of fear move through her and held his hand even more tightly.
- Koschei resisted the urge to smack the other him and reminded himself that he'd
  barely been free of Rassilon for a week.
- /Hold her, kiss her, and tell her it will all be all right,/ he sent back more gently.
- Susan leaned up and kissed him.
- The Master was quite certain there were things he was supposed to have said, but
  he couldn't for the life of him think of what they might be.
- Tomoko walked into the console room to find a tall, skinny man in a gray jumpsuit
  and blue trainers leaning against the piloting controls, while Koschei's legs stuck
  out from underneath.
- He twisted around so that he could look at her face.
- She grinned and folded up to cuddle next to him, leaning against his shoulder.
- He looked at her and shook his head.
- She didn't respond immediately, flipping around the notebook, until she came to
  a particular screen and stopped dead on it.
- Tomoko turned her full attention to him.
- The screen filled with faces.
- The Doctor peered into the screen and waved at Diana-37.
- Diana-37 looked at Jake-77.
- He waved his hand dismissively.
- They still had to figure out a way to survive all this after all.
- Koschei watched as Tomoko and the other four Mashas walked past the console and
  out of the TARDIS, Tomoko waved a little as she left.
- The Doctor looked up as they trooped by.
- Everyone looked at each other.
- They had trooped out of the TARDIS in relative silence, and in relative silence,
  they all trooped back.
- Adie jumped, and by reflex tried to sit up, managing only to bang her head hard
  on the top of the crawlspace.
- Adie twisted around in the space until she could see his shoes, shoes that she recognized.
- She tucked in her own feet a little bit farther, and began turning.
- She nodded thoughtfully, then realized that while she was working here, he couldn't
  see her nodded.
- Adie worked up her courage and backed out of the crawlspace.
- She sighed visibly.
- She got her spanner in place and held it steady and didn't say anything for a while.
- She thought of that for a few minutes, her eyes curiously flat.
- She turned to him and looked genuinely frightened.
- She was silent for a long time.
- She smiled at him.
- He nodded and then finished with his repairs with the board.
- She looked at him.
- She shook her head.
- Adie looked unconvinced, but desisted.
- Tomoko looked back and forth between them all.
- The Doctor laughed.
- Tomoko smirked and dropped her head back down over her notepad, while the Doctor
  and Rose continued working.
- Tomoko pulled the lever and was rewarded by a sudden burst of sparks from a nearby
  panel.
- Koschei crawled out of the vent and sat there, looking at the Doctor with worried
  eyes and Rose was frowning now.
- That made Tomoko's smile a bit stronger.
- Susan and Koschei looked at each other and Tomoko got the impression that they were
  having a deep conversation of some sort.
- Susan turned to look at her grandfather, her face pensive, and continued the conversation.
- Susan looked at Koschei and felt his agreement in her mind.
- /Together always, love,/ Koschei murmured to her and she turned and smiled sadly
  at him.
- /No matter what,/ she agreed.
- Tomoko reached up her hand for it, to see if it would alight there, but it simply
  shifted closer to the controls, acting as a guide for her.
- She felt a twinge of sorrow, looking at it.
- In fact, peering at it more closely, it looked more like wadded-up paper inside,
  she could glimpse a few scribbles in circular Gallifreyan on it.
- The Butterfly seemed contented with her efforts, because it fluttered off and drifted
  up to the canopy of vines, where it joined a dozen others in a myriad of sparkling
  jewel-like colours.
- Dear Amaranthia,
- Someone's coming; I'll hide this letter and come back later.
- I love you, always,
- Farian
- He read it in silence and frowned.
- She'd turned the temperature down as far as she could and then began stripping off
  her coat, kicking off her shoes, and allowing the many drugs in her system to be
  nullified by the slug attached to her stomach.
- The door opened and a ginger head poked in, a pair of warm brown eyes regarding
  her curiously through the archway.
- She turned Susan's words carefully over in her mind, looking at the many facets
  of the problem and then nodded slowly.
- After several minutes, Tomoko had worked her aura back down to its typical levels
  of brilliance, instead of the painfully hot glare of light.
- Tomoko exhaled thoughtfully, her breath icing into a cloud of mist.
- Tomoko blinked in genuine surprise.
- Tomoko raised an eyebrow.
- Tomoko pondered this.
- Susan grinned and ticked off on her fingers.
- She walked back across the room.
- Tomoko stared after her as Susan walked away.
- /I'm depending on you to guard her,/ he sent to Guinn who nodded.
- Koschei nodded.
- Koschei hid his smile, but it was hard, when Rose was grinning broadly at them.
- Jake looked up and nodded.
- Tomoko-6 arrived to general cheers.
- Tomoko sighed and her eyes brightened visibly.
- It was what he'd been thinking about for two years, as he gathered them, and he
  needed to know the answer now, before he saw them let loose on the universe.
- Tomoko nodded at him and he sat down, while she stood up and took over.
- There was silence.
- He held up his hand and then turned it into a fist-pump.
- Diana-37 slipped her hand into his.
- She looked at him thoughtfully.
- In the image, Tomoko was talking to a group of the Mashas and Jake.
- Koschei snorted and the Doctor laughed.
- The three Time Lords looked up from what they were doing, Koschei and the Doctor
  were playing a game with a multitude of coloured sticks and tweezers, while Rose
  smiled up at her from her spot on the floor.
- Jake, Diana-37, and the rest of the group came in behind her, looking around at
  the TARDIS in wonderment.
- Zoi-29 walked into his workshop and stopped dead in her tracks, mouth open, and
  tears starting in her eyes.
- Together they went to work and he pretended not to see her petting the tools and
  crying.
- Puzzled, he unfolded the cloth.
- Jake looked up when he heard the Doctor's quiet cursing.
- Tomoko began snapping out orders and the Mashas scrambled out of their rooms, down
  the hallways, and out of the doors.
- Moira smiled grimly at the other two.
- Nikki ignored her and charged the beetle head on, her monofilament blade humming
  in the cold still air.
- A loud humming noise pulled their minds back to the fight as three large Wasps came
  over the hill to join the remaining Beetle.
- Diana ran forwards, grabbing Neveah and hoisting her over her shoulder.
- Behind her, Nikki-69 said nothing, just fought with all of her fury and skill to
  keep the Wasp from moving closer to the TARDIS.
- Diana ran to her.
- It took fourteen minutes, an eternity as far as battles went, before they were finally
  able to clean up the last of the bugs.
- They made for a dreary picture when they limped painfully back aboard the TARDIS.
- Susan was forced to dose them in alkaloids and then carefully peel it off, a small
  bit at a time, handing the flecks over to K-9 to incinerate.
- It took most of the day, but at last all the Mashas were sleeping it off, curled
  up in various beds.
- Tomoko left Susan to comfort Jake, and went to find Koschei.
- In the storeroom she found the Doctor and Rose, already sorting through boxes.
- Rose was taking things from him and putting them on a float cart and with a shrug,
  Tomoko joined in.
- Four hundred feet away, she spotted it, and they got close enough to observe it,
  although they were careful to give it a very wide berth.
- Several hours later they trudged into the Console room and found Koschei bent over
  the controls.
- Koschei looked uncomfortable at that and Tomoko nodded.
- They all turned to look at the screen, where the sun was setting into the snow and
  in the distance flashes of light, like the twinkling of far off stars gave away
  the positions of more insects.
- Rose studied Diana's face for a long moment and then nodded.
- After a minute of uncomfortable silence, Tomoko-6 crossed her arms.
- Many of the Mashas looked at each other.
- He felt rather like a condemned prisoner walking towards the gallows, as their angry
  eyes lingered on him.
- Lastly, no matter how confusing all of our timestreams get, no matter what happens,
  you will always my daughter and I will always love you.
- Hope I see you soon,
- I guess I will just say,
- Your daughter
- He held in his hand a small circular ball that glowed with an odd, green light,
  and he watched it with a certain intrigue and grace with which you would inspect
  a person for injury after a fall.
- It clicked again and a sliding part moved over the inside, and for a second he saw
  a small cube inside, but it was gone again before he could do anything about it.
- Still with it in-hand, the Doctor made his way back to the console room, giving
  this curious little orb more attention than he perhaps should have, resulting in
  him taking two wrong turns and having to circle back.
- The Universe was obsessed with him dying.
- The story had interested the Doctor, even though he was looking for some quiet time
  alone, and he intended to go there and investigate the hypnotic caves of a moon
  called Gug.
- He picked up the orb as the TARDIS began moving off towards Gug, throwing it into
  the air, testing it's weight.
- Oh god.
- ! 'Perhaps that''s why the universe keeps trying to get rid of him: it''s grown
  sick of him.'
- He searched the leaflet, but it didn't give a number of how many people had been
  lost inside before they had set up these posts.
- Apparently, there used to be live guards watching the mouth of the cave to make
  sure people didn't walk in, but the guards kept walking in too, so that was an abandoned
  idea.
- He heard a beep from his pocket.
- It began to vibrate violently, shaking in his hands until he covered the cube up,
  pushing the sides of the orb back into their stubborn places.
- But why?
- Maybe that was it.
- ! '''Because I''m not sure anymore,'' said the voice.'
- And, if that meant that 'God' was just a writer with an offbeat sense of humour
  and a slightly inflated ego, this meant that 'heading towards the light' was spelling
  of certain doom, or of great untold riches and pleasantness.
- A TARDIS.
- ! '''I see it,'' he eventually responded.'
- ! '''I''m not mad?'''
- ! '''Who?'''
- ! '''Yeah.'''
- ! '''Screwdriver?'''
- ! '''It''s sonic!'''
- ! '''Why?'''
- ! '''Where am I?'''
- ! '''A space-boat, yes.'''
- Nothing.
- ! '''How would that help?'''
- The sound of feet, rushing down the cave and into small, hidden, dark passages could
  be heard, but neither the Doctor nor the boy could see.
- ! '''So,'' he said, ''what''s the plan?'''
- ! '''You want a plan, now?'''
- ! '''I don''t remember.'''
- ! '''A cave?'''
- ! '''And when did you get here?'''
- ! '''When did I get here?'''
- ! '''As long as I can remember.'''
- ! '''Yes, I know, don''t worry.'''
- There was a sound somewhere in the cave.
- ! '''Are what coming back?'''
- The boy moved with him, still occasionally punishing himself for something, hitting
  and biting himself.
- They began down a corridor deeper into this TARDIS, it's cave walls claustrophobic
  and all bizarrely similar, giving the boy no way of keeping up with where they were
  headed down the twists and turns of the caves, moving deeper and deeper down.
- After darting round corners, holding back the boy's arms and avoiding anything that
  wasn't fully lit, the lights started to demand attention.
- One cut out directly above the young boy, scaring him half to death.
- At first the Doctor tried to ignore it, and he began to walk away.
- ! '''I know you,'' came a voice.'
- The boy started to cry.
- He could feel the shadow smiling at him.
- ! '''I know it ends.'''
- ! '''You are alive, then?'''
- ! '''Life is a fault.'''
- ! '''You are correct.'''
- ! '''We are not in your Universe.'''
- The Doctor's face dropped.
- ! '''You were so close, Doctor.'''
- ! '''But there wasn''t a door,'' the boy said.'
- ! '''Your memories are not mine to steal,'' it said, as the lights began to turn
  back on, revealing the corridor, or cave, rather, that they had followed down here.'
- ! '''Simuss.'''
- But it was his.
- Simuss.
- ! '''That''s my name,'' he said, just as the shadow evaporated, leaving the empty,
  light corridor open to them.'
- He had a brainwave, however.
- The Doctor bounced up to him, tearing out from his bigger-on-the-inside pockets
  a dark blue stethoscope.
- A second heartbeat.
- The rhythm of time, pumping through this boy's veins, coursing through him.
- Moving the stethoscope away from the boy's chest, he looked Simuss directly in the
  eye and, with grace and nobility, and a desperate eagerness, took the boy in his
  arms, lifting him off the floor.
- The Doctor thought back, to what had lead him here.
- ! '''And we''ll figure out why not in a little while, okay?'''
- ! '''Alright.'''
- ! '''For now, we get out.'''
- ! '''What about the shadows?'''
- ! '''Why?'''
- ! '''Where do we go after we leave?'''
- ! '''We''ll figure that out when we get there, Sim!'''
- That was it, he realised.
- That was what was plaguing the Doctor.
- And now he had no clear direction.
- They continued on, slowly now, with the Doctor still silent.
- ! '''Good thing I''m not human,'' Simuss said.'
- It felt wrong, what happened after that moment.
- ! '''Maybe what?'''
- ! '''Plus, there are shadows in an alien ship that, according to everything I know
  and believe, can''t exist.'''
- ! '''Why not?'''
- ! '''How did you do it?'''
- ! '''River?'''
- It dragged a shiver up the Doctor's spine.
- Simuss avoided looking at them directly at all.
- ! '''I want out of this prison.'''
- ! '''For what purpose?'''
- ! '''Freedom.'''
- ! '''Well, you were all ''the only fault is life'' - what was that all about?'''
- ! '''What would you do?'''
- ! '''I have not murdered anyone.'''
- He held it up and the shadows seemed to hide away, shifting back.
- ! '''Yes, well, I have a very definitive persona,'' he said with a perfectly straight
  face.'
- ! '''What''s inside?'''
- ! '''Once it has seen all it need to.'''
- ! '''Into what?'''
- ! '''Time Lord.'''
- There was a silence.
- ! '''I''m lost,'' Simuss said, not following.'
- ! '''Why can''t you?'''
- ! '''What, so whatever did this is in there, with my memories?'''
- ! '''And countless others, swimming around together.'''
- ! '''And if you let out my memories, you let out the big bad monster that trapped
  them in there.'''
- ! '''Yeah.'''
- ! '''You assume I haven''t got a plan, young Simuss,'' the Doctor chimed, inspecting
  the box in one hand.'
- ! '''What, so you don''t have a plan?'''
- ! '''Of course not, who told you I did?'''
- ! '''You did!'''
- ! '''So?'''
- ! '''Would it make a difference?'''
- ! '''And if we''re clueless?'''
- SImuss and the Doctor both stopped and stared at the shadows, the Doctor sporting
  a small smile.
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''Well, I thought you could help us...'''
- ! '''You think they''re still down there?'''
- ! '''How long has this cave been here?'''
- ! '''What the hell are you on about?!'''
- ! '''What does that mean?'''
- ! '''And you''re going to do it.'''
- ! '''Just do it, Doctor.'''
- He pressed it.
- Click.
- The top flipped over.
- For a second, there was nothing.
- The shadows, now behind the Doctor, dispersed, becoming nothing more than black
  smoke that filtered into the green light as it collected above the box, which had
  been dropped onto the floor.
- It formed a human-like shape above the box once the yellow light had cleared.
- Simuss was still asleep, out from his fall.
- Suddenly there was no more TARDIS.
- No more cold.
- The air was warm and dry, a breeze hitting him.
- He could see a few other bodies, all dispersed over the desert.
- He couldn't really remember much of what had happened within the caves.
- His steadied himself up on his elbows, looking around at all of the people he could
  see on the desert ground, moaning in the heat as they woke up.
- Sure enough, they were all human, and he had them in a large circle in a few minutes,
  with the Doctor standing on a small rock just to show his status of knowing possibly
  a little more than the rest of them.
- ! '''As do most boxes,'' the teenage girl smirked.'
- ! '''This guy''s a nutter, look at his shoes!'''
- ! '''Everyone-'' the Doctor was completely ignored.'
- ! '''People, will you-'' Simuss tried, but he was yelled at by someone who shut
  him up completely.'
- Then they all stopped blaming eachother, and they looked to the man in the funny
  bowtie.
- ! '''Who the hell are you?'', ''Why do you know so much?'', ''How come he gets all
  the answers?'''
- The crowd fell silent.
- He swallowed.
- ! '''I''ll go with the man,'' Harper said, stepping forward.'
- ! '''With help.'''
- ! '''Yet?'''
- ! '''I get told that a lot,'' the Doctor admitted.'
- ! '''Do you intend to do good this time?'''
- Harper looked unimpressed.
- ! '''Bigger?'''
- ! '''I don''t think I like this,'' Harper said just before he was flung off his
  feet by the TARDIS'' momentum.'
- ! '''I wouldn''t have let you bring me out if is wasn''t,'' she smiled.'
- But this felt so right, being back in the TARDIS.
- On a job, working a mystery.
- As they appeared from the box, the crying boy latched himself to the Doctor.
- Clara mouthed 'hey-ho', trying to work out whether he had genuinely thought it was
  a good idea.
- They blinked.
- ! '''I don''t know, you''re supposed to tell me!'''
- ! '''Maybe you are, but my family is missing and you''re all we have.'''
- ! '''...and?'''
- ! '''...You''re kidding me.'''
- ! '''Of course I am, you''re sticking with me.'''
- Simuss hopped after them, giving a curious look back at the crowd.
- ! '''Are they going to be okay?'''
- ! '''If you had all of time and space to explore, and you''d been locked in a cave
  for God-knows how long, where would you go?'''
- ! '''Couldn''t be, Time War and everything.'''
- ! '''Well-'''
- The TARDIS gave a hum, almost in agreement.
- ! '''That''s a good-'''
- ! '''Or it could be a monster, good and simple,'' Simuss suggested.'
- ! '''In the dark?'''
- ! '''Are we helping?'''
- ! '''I don''t think so.'''
- They stared at him, waiting to know.
- They paused.
- Eventually Clara said, 'We know.'
- ! '''We''re in a pocket universe,'' Clara said, nodding.'
- ! '''Can we?'''
- ! '''...What?'''
- ! '''Leak?'''
- ! '''Leaking?'''
- ! '''So that''s what''s happened here.'''
- ! '''Not necessarily, but if it is, we need to know how big it''s gotten and how
  fast it''s growing and if we can move faster to get out.'''
- ! '''If not?'''
- They were stumped.
- ! '''I don''t know where you''re going with this,'' Simuss stated, honestly dumbfounded.'
- ! '''Dirty work?'''
- The Doctor smiled as he started pressing buttons again, calculating the distance
  the room that they were trapped within seemed to have between walls.
- ! '''I feel like that''s going to be the bad news.'''
- ! '''Nothing?'''
- Simuss nodded, Clara looked unnerved, the Doctor smiled.
- ! '''You''re worrying me,'' Clara said.'
- ! '''...What?'''
- The three of them peered out as the door slid open, revealing the burning sun Gus
  as it loomed over where Gug should be, hanging in the black against the stars.
- ! '''There you go, dad.'''
- ! '''Do you have to call me that?'''
- ! '''I see a floaty green thing with a TARDIS and fifty people on the surface of
  a moon that you''ve taken hostage with families that, I presume, you''ve also taken
  hostage.'''
- ! '''So you are Time Lord.'''
- ! '''Stolen.'''
- ! '''As is yours.'''
- ! '''Do you?'''
- ! '''Well then, I''m sure it''ll take you no time to work it all out.'''
- ! '''I thought you were clever.'''
- ! '''I am.'''
- ! '''I did.'''
- ! '''Check them.'''
- ! '''What about those people?'''
- ! '''Find them and you can keep them.'''
- ! '''What the hell does that mean?'''
- ! '''If what''s possible?'''
- ! '''To make a Time Lord out of a Human.'''
- What that the green figure seemed to evaporate into stardust, leaving Clara, Simuss
  and the Doctor, each with their own versions of a particularly shocked expression.
- Simuss, Clara and the Doctor all looked to where the green figure had been only
  a moment ago, and saw the burnt-orange surface of that little desert moon.
- ! '''And what do I mean?'''
- ! '''You mean you''re hurt.'''
- ! '''You?'''
- ! '''This again?'''
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''You have bad taste.'''
- ! '''You''re no monster.'''
- ! '''What is it?'''
- ! '''Disguised as a moon?'''
- ! '''He has another TARDIS?'''
- ! '''What?'''
- ! '''Simuss, when you were a Time Lord, what was it like?'''
- Time Lords get things wrong, too, she thought.
- He gave her a smile and a poke to the forehead - she assumed this was some form
  of a show of endearment - and pulled a single lever, sending them into the TARDIS
  at the heart of that small moon.
- Clara wasn't prepared to see what had happened to all those innocent people at the
  hands of the Doctor's brethren.
- Simuss wasn't prepared to step back into the vicinity of the creature that had stolen
  his humanity, and was taking other people's too.
- He lead them towards the pillar, the unimaginably tall pillar of white glass and
  shimmering lights.
- ! '''Don''t know,'' the Doctor said.'
- ! '''Don''t know,'' the Doctor said again.'
- ! '''Don''t know anything, apparently,'' the Doctor laughed.'
- ! '''I do,'' said Susan.'
- ! '''Not in the war.'''
- ! '''How did you do it?'''
- ! '''That''ll be the cave,'' the Doctor noted.'
- ! '''You went last?'''
- ! '''Alone?'''
- ! '''Yes.'''
- ! '''And you died because of it.'''
- ! '''I was wrong, I know-'''
- She flickered again.
- ! '''It''s a Time Lord.'''
- ! '''One of us?'''
- ! '''I''m guessing so.'''
- ! '''You don''t know?'''
- Clara did it for her, keeping him upright as his body sagged.
- ! '''Yes, well, I have a very definitive persona,'' he said with a perfectly straight
  face.'
- ! '''What''s inside?'''
- ! '''Once it has seen all it need to.'''
- ! '''Into what?'''
- ! '''Time Lord.'''
- There was a silence.
- ! '''I''m lost,'' Simuss said, not following.'
- ! '''Why can''t you?'''
- ! '''What, so whatever did this is in there, with my memories?'''
- ! '''And countless others, swimming around together.'''
- ! '''And if you let out my memories, you let out the big bad monster that trapped
  them in there.'''
- ! '''Yeah.'''
- ! '''I know,'' the Doctor nodded, holding his mouth.'
- ! '''PTSD?'''
- ! '''I was going to ask, how does a Time-Lord turn into a glowing green mass in
  a box?'''
- ! '''I''ll try,'' she said, and promptly flickered out of existence.'
- Pop.
- It was off.
- Clara and Simuss began working immediately, getting every person out as slowly and
  cautiously as possible, but a slick as they could.
- While they were working, Susan reappeared next to the Doctor, her head low.
- His eyes began to glow a deep emerald green, a green that quickly enveloped his
  body.
- ! '''Why''s that?'''
- All of a sudden, the Doctor was back in the room, like a bad hypnosis trick.
- ! '''I''m not sure he was ''all there''.'''
- It seemed that barely a minute had passed, as Simuss and Clara had managed to unhook
  barely fifty of the two hundred, so the Doctor joined in.
- Two hundred people hidden under the skin of a false moon, one of them possessed
  by a Time Lord intent on releasing the Time War, and a TARDIS disguised as said
  moon that also happens to be sitting on top of the very hole in reality Carltesque
  wanted to rip open.
- This was an interesting one.
- Nothing.
- Carl was gone in amidst a sea of the innocent.
- Again.
- So he had a back-up.
- ! '''...What?'''
- ! '''Well, you didn''t think I was going to turn you off, did you?'''
- ! '''I...'''
- ! '''Okay?'''
- ! '''I soniced you.'''
- ! '''For what?'''
- He'd missed her.
- ! '''I''ve missed you, Granddad.'''
- ! '''I know, but now it actually works!'''
- ! '''I hate it when you call it that.'''
- ! '''Nope.'''
- ! '''You didn''t even listen to me!'''
- ! '''We''re not going Dalek-hunting.'''
- ! '''You''re not my dad.'''
- That's what made it so easy.
- ! '''My list?'''
- Lussi came back through, now with a small piece of paper in her hands.
- ! '''There''s the Daleks-'''
- ! '''A new one?'''
- ! '''The man was Death.'''
- ! '''Then everything got bad again.'''
- ! '''I''ll think about it,'' Jaymse relented.'
- ! '''And what''s mine?'''
- ! '''Yeah, but I want to go to the beaches there.'''
- ! '''Are you going in disguise?'''
- ! '''Nahh, I''ll just try a few on the trip over.'''
- They took a left down a wider stretch that lead to a huge port, to which thousands
  of ships were tethered, hovering over ground and water alike.
- Jaymse settled into the single seat at the front while Lussi stood behind him, hands
  latched onto the sides of his huge leather chair.
- ! '''We''re about to land,'' Jaymse announced just as Lussi reverted back into her
  usual humanoid shape, and she joined him in the front of house, looking down onto
  the beautiful green and red planet below.'
- The made their way to the beach on their right, where Lussi could already see at
  least two species of alien she'd never met before, and was tugging at Jaymse to
  let her grab a sample of sweat or something, just to let her try it out.
- Jaymse, however, had noticed an aim of his own.
- She changed in a matter of seconds into a perfectly identical version of the male
  Fox-like Plothrite, only female and wearing clothes that made her out to be completely
  out of place.
- Not giving half a damn, Lussi strolled over and started talking to the Plothrite,
  possibly flirting a little to keep his attention, and then strolled back over to
  Jaymse.
- ! '''He knows you''re a thief who wants his chair,'' she said.'
- ! '''What about you?'''
- ! '''Can you get it?'''
- ! '''What is it?'''
- ! '''Nope.'''
- It stank.
- Like really.
- It smelt like wet socks feel.
- ! '''Err, I must insist.'''
- ! '''You run a stall?'''
- ! '''I do, friend.'''
- Jaymse gagged.
- ! '''What did you say you would do?'''
- ! '''What do you mean?'''
- ! '''I think he might be a little deluded.'''
- ! '''You think?'''
- ! '''I think he thought I was going to follow him.'''
- ! '''Why would he think that?'''
- Jaymse smiled, holding the stool under his leg when he heard Hawll over his shoulder,
  yelling something in a language he didn't know.
- Jaymse was the first to stop laughing as he saw a figure through the fog and smoke
  from their ship; a face he really didn't want to see.
- He said nothing.
- They set off home.
- Jaymse wasn't even sure it was who he thought it was.
- It probably wasn't.
- It could be anyone.
- But was it him?
- Silence.
- He brought up courage to look inside, into the light.
- He saw Lussi in her.
- Damn.
- This wasn't the right place.
- He tried to walk, but his strength was plummetting and his leg gave out under him.
- The black stone floor was unnaturally warm against his shins as he dragged himself
  up to the man's side.
- He couldn't even remember his name.
- He couldn't allow that.
- He had to live.
- He had to protect her.
- Lussi asked something.
- The Daughters screamed something.
- The Sun burned.
- Her lips were next to his as she whispered 'I know what you've done Jaymse, and
  I will never forgive you.'
- And with the sound of a flapping curtain, he was alone.
- Even the daughter was gone.
- Next to him was a glass Jaymse would find to have held poison - the same poison
  Jaymse then absorbed, leading to Lussi discovering him.
- He'd been greedy.
- He killed a father.
- Lussi had left.
- She was gone.
- Lussi.
- If she wasn't back in the tent, then he hadn't dreamt it, it was real and he'd just
  missed another day.
- He darted back to the tent he had left Lussi in, their tent, throwing aside her
  curtain and bursting in, calling her name.
- ! '''Lussi?!'''
- Her bed seemed flat, but as he threw back the covers he saw her, curled up, with
  light blurring against her face.
- ! '''You were on your phone?'''
- ! '''I''m so sorry...'''
- ! '''Yeah?'''
- ! '''Lussi listen to me-'''
- ! '''And we''ll stay for the market day, but after that we need to go, okay?'''
- ! '''Do you?'''
- ! '''Do you remember home, Lussi?'''
- ! '''Left?'''
- ! '''Left.'''
- ! '''Do you remember why he ''left''?'''
- ! '''Do you remember that feeling, Lussi?'''
- ! '''Do you remember?'''
- ! '''Where is it from?'''
- ! '''There''s a place...'''
- ! '''Yes?'''
- ! '''A bubble?'''
- ! '''What''s it called?'''
- ! '''Home, Lussi.'''
- ! '''Isn''t that good?'''
- ! '''I remember Famine.'''
- ! '''That''s me, good.'''
- ! '''You were Famine?'''
- ! '''That''s right.'''
- My life was a whole bunch of why's.
- I am the unknown girl, eight hundred and seventy three years old, who's real name
  hasn't been spoken in almost as many years.
- My first ever Doctor Who fan fiction, but I really wanted to write it after realizing
  just how much I love the eleventh doctor.
- ! 'Chapter 1: Invitations'
- Olivia froze and turned a glare to her mother, ready to start an argument, but a
  knock at the door drew their attention to it.
- Olivia pulled the box open and grinned at the sight of a brand new Silver Sonic
  Screwdriver inside, sitting delicately in the packaging inside.
- Utah...
- He sighed again and leaned back on the hood on the station wagon, taking her hands
  in his and pulling her closer.
- They all jumped when a gunshot sounded, sending the Stetson on his head flying off
  it before they all looked behind him to see River blowing the end of the barrel
  of her revolver before shoving it into her holster.
- Later...
- The Doctor smiled at her and she could tell he knew she wanted explanations.
- The Shore of a Lake...
- Olivia nearly spit out her sip before looking at him with huge eyes.
- Amy giggled before looking up and she seemed distracted, making Olivia frown but
  she said nothing.
- Olivia gave a squeak when the Doctor grabbed her around her waist and pulled her
  against him, making her giggle when she landed.
- They all stood, frozen in their spots as they watched at the Doctor, who seemed
  to be speaking to the astronaut before he lowered his head, River coming up next
  to Olivia to take her arm, feeling her trembling.
- They all jumped when a gunshot sounded, the Doctor falling back with a green blast
  to his chest.
- They all froze when the Doctor fell to his knees and she could see the familiar
  golden glow of his hands, signaling his regeneration.
- Amy uncurled herself and set her head on his chest, still sobbing as Olivia stared
  down at him, stroking his hair and face.
- Sunset...
- Olivia sniffled and turned to follow River toward the old man that had given them
  the gasoline.
- Without another word he placed his baseball cap on his head and turned to head back
  to his van as River and Olivia turned to Amy and Rory.
- Later at the Diner...
- Without a word River slapped him across the face, the force of it sending his head
  whipping to the side and he looked surprised as he looked back at her.
- ! 'Chapter 2: Secrets'
- Olivia looked up to see Amy head down the stairs leading to the underside of the
  console but said nothing and didn't go after her.
- He tapped a button on the screen as the four crowded around him.
- He plopped down in the jump seat, making the four glance at each other before cautiously
  heading around the console to stare at him as he leaned his head into his hand then
  looked up at the group.
- She still said nothing as they only stared at each other.
- River and Olivia parted to head toward the computer where he stopped and they all
  looked at the screen.
- Olivia couldn't help but smirk and shake her head as the Doctor began running around
  the console.
- The image on the scanner soon revealed the Doctor being held down by men in suits
  in the Oval Office of the White House.
- The two worked on the console to obey him before looking back at the scanner to
  see the men in suits staring at the TARDIS in awe and disbelief, then looking to
  see that the Doctor had escaped their grasp.
- It wasn't long before the maps were spread out around the Oval Office, all five
  of them looking over the maps as the Doctor jumped around all of them, Nixon and
  Canton watching them with two other agents in the room.
- Olivia frowned at him from where she sat on the edge of the president's desk, watching
  everyone, and when her gaze fell on Amy heading toward River she stepped toward
  them as well.
- Olivia watched River for a moment before looking to Amy, seeing a terrified look
  on her face and stepped closer to her.
- He nodded to her as she followed Amy, Rory attempting to follow them but being stopped
  by Peterson.
- The thing had no time to reply before a toilet flushed and a stall opened to reveal
  a blonde woman in a pantsuit stepping toward the sink.
- The woman turned to them, frowned in wonder through her huge red glasses then turned
  and screamed in fright before laughing.
- ! 'Chapter 3: Astronaut'
- Olivia caught the sound of a telephone ringing as she and Amy rounded into the Oval
  Office where President Nixon stood from his desk, the Doctor leaning in front of
  him with a map over the desk, Canton right next to him.
- Olivia and Canton looked to the map as River stepped closer to them as well.
- Olivia, the Doctor and River ran around the console to fly it, Amy watching them
  as Rory stood with Canton by the door, Canton staring around the TARDIS in shock
  and awe.
- River only winked back at her and Olivia couldn't help but roll her eyes with a
  smirk.
- The Doctor slid to a stop, almost running into Canton, making the women behind him
  do the same as Canton glanced between them all.
- ! 'Olivia stepped up next to him as he parted the blinds and revealed three street
  signs: Jefferson Street, Hamilton Avenue, and Adams Street.'
- Olivia pulled out her Sonic to scan the machine, River using her handheld as Amy
  stepped next to the blonde with a flashlight.
- Olivia hurried around the machine and toward River, as did the Doctor when she moved
  the cover away from the hole where the cords led.
- He shot his gaze to her, their eyes locking, instantly.
- Olivia swallowed, doing as he said and watching a frown come to his brow.
- Olivia sighed, but nodded before stepping next to him, using her Sonic on something
  he lifted from the table they were standing next to.
- She nodded and left a kiss to his cheek before heading toward them as they looked
  over the machine.
- She watched the Doctor drag Amy after him before they all rounded a corner and Olivia
  frowned at the red head.
- Olivia pulled Amy with her toward Canton who didn't move and the Doctor looked him
  over.
- It stopped and lifted a hand to the helmet as Amy turned and grabbed Canton's gun,
  discarded on the floor, but Olivia and the Doctor saw the child inside the suit.
- Amy pulled the trigger with a scream.
- ! 'Chapter 4: Fights'
- She instantly realized his meaning and tried to yank out of his grip in anger, but
  they'd reached the car and he shoved her into the back seat, another agent getting
  in on the other side of her, two more in the front.
- Area 51 Nevada...
- Olivia swallowed as she glanced between the body bags the agents were dragging on
  either side of her before she looked to the huge box in the center of the huge building.
- He shoved her into the doorway of the cube where she stared wide eyes at the Doctor
  as he sat in a chair in the center of it, wearing a straitjacket wrapped in chains
  with months worth of beard and hair on his face and head.
- Olivia instantly stood on her knees with a groan, stretching out her back as the
  Doctor stood and wriggled out of his restraints easily and the bags next to them
  sat up, gasping.
- She pulled him forward and planted a kiss to his lips as he stared at her in shock
  before she instantly pulled away with a strange look over her face.
- Olivia released his face, letting him lift his jacket off the chair near the stairs
  and put it on before they both ran around the console again.
- She tossed it to him before heading after Amy and Rory as they headed for the TARDIS
  showers, then the wardrobe, and it wasn't long before they all regrouped in the
  control room again where the Doctor hadn't left the console.
- He grabbed Olivia's hand and bolted toward the door, making her give a squeak of
  surprise before giggling as he pulled the door open, everyone following behind them
  as they stepped into a field and he pulled her to face a rocket.
- Later...
- Olivia turned and marched toward the console and the Doctor followed quickly.
- The Doctor hit something on the console that made an image appear near the doorway,
  making Canton look around when he noticed the Doctor glance that way.
- Canton turned and once he took his eyes off the creature he calmly reached up and
  straightened the Doctor's bowtie as everyone stared at him with wide eyes.
- Canton pressed the button and a beep sounded before the entire conversation played
  over again, making him slowly turn and stare wide eyes at the creature he saw…again.
- They all stared at it before the image disappeared.
- Later...
- Olivia sighed before her phone went off and she frowned as she pulled it out, looking
  to the caller ID then answering it.
- Footsteps caught her ear and she looked up to the end of the hall with wide eyes,
  swallowing hard.
- She hung up the phone as the two men in lab coats stared at her and the Doctor as
  he sat up in the hatch of Apollo 11.
- Later...
- Olivia glared at the Doctor as they sat side by side in handcuffs in a room that
  looked more like a classroom than a room at NASA, two men in white shirts, ties
  and khakis standing in front of them, a guard behind them.
- Olivia frowned at him as she watched him lift his cuffed hands to his face and bite
  the chain between them in what she could only assume was frustration.
- The door to the room opened to reveal President Nixon, followed by River and Rory
  in professional wear.
- Nixon looked to them and Olivia noticed Rory look up as well and River shook her
  head with a knowing smirk as the Doctor mouthed 'Sorry' to Nixon.
- He grabbed Olivia's hand and pulled her toward the door the three had entered to
  head into the TARDIS sitting outside the room.
- Olivia swallowed against the lump forming in her throat at the thought of what she'd
  seen back at the lake and looked away from him before he could see the tears forming.
- Rory retreated up the stairs where Olivia had disappeared, leaving River and the
  Doctor alone in the control room.
- They stared each other down before she turned and headed for the stairs.
- ! 'Chapter 5: Rescue'
- Rory stepped toward the light and knelt down to pick up the nanorecorder then looked
  to the Doctor.
- The Doctor ran out of the room followed by the rest of them until they reached the
  manager's office where they found one of the creatures on the floor.
- Back at the Warehouse...
- River and the Doctor examined the astronaut suit the little girl had escaped from
  as Olivia watched them, Rory cradling the nanorecorder.
- They all watched the launch of Apollo 11 before the Doctor's handheld beeped and
  Olivia looked to Rory when she heard Amy sobbing on the nanorecroder he still held,
  River still using her handheld on the suit.
- Meanwhile...
- Amy re-awoke in a daze, wincing at the blinding light above her before she looked
  around and realized she was strapped into a chair in a spaceship…surrounded by the
  Silence.
- The Silent inched closer to her face as she protested, struggling against her restraints…but
  the sound of the TARDIS engines filled the room, stopping it and the Silence in
  the room looked to it as it appeared and the Doctor opened the door.
- Olivia marched around the console that the Silence were manning, carrying a TV as
  the Doctor followed right behind her.
- The Silent he was speaking to said nothing and only stared at him.
- They said nothing as the live footage from the moon showed up on the TV.
- She and the Doctor looked to the TV as it still went on.
- The Doctor's plan had worked.
- She grabbed the Doctor's sleeve as the Silence attacked, hitting the TV instead
  of him with a zap from its huge middle finger.
- Olivia ran around the console as Rory got Amy inside, sitting her in the chair next
  to the console and Olivia looked to him with a frown.
- Olivia shoved the Doctor past her toward the console as she watched River take out
  every Silence in a graceful twirl until she stopped and twirled her gun on her finger,
  swiftly holstering it.
- The Doctor opened his mouth to reply but Olivia only walked around him to head toward
  the stairs.
- Oval Office...
- She sighed through her nose with a smirk before shoving off the TARDIS and stepping
  toward them as the Doctor placed his hand on the small of her back, just below her
  jacket, to lead her next to him, making her swallow.
- Olivia nodded to her as River headed toward the stairs leading deeper into the TARDIS,
  Amy and River curiously looking over the console.
- River nodded before heading toward the stairs leading deeper into the TARDIS as
  Amy and Rory stood at the bottom.
- Olivia smiled and nodded before wrapping her arms around him under his jacket, resting
  her head on his chest, feeling one of his hearts thump against her cheek.
- Olivia couldn't help but giggle as she lifted her head to rest her chin on his chest
  and grin up at him.
- Olivia couldn't help but let out a hearty laugh.
- ! 'Chapter 6: Questions'
- Olivia finally pulled herself away from the screen to rush toward the door and look
  out at River and the Doctor.
- Olivia swallowed as she watched him head toward her and step up into the threshold,
  before he turned back to River.
- Olivia moved out of the way to let the Doctor pass as she stared at River's depressed
  and disappointed expression with sorrow and sympathy.
- River only nodded before turning into her cell to let the door shut and Olivia turned
  back into the TARDIS, shutting the door behind her to head toward the console.
- He frowned at her in wonder but she only shook her head before they both looked
  to Amy as she stepped up next to her.
- She shook her head as if to shake the memories back to her.
- Later...
- She took in a deep breath before resting her head on his shoulder, still playing
  with his bowtie.
- He said nothing as he only held her.
- The Doctor dropped his Sonic again and tried catching it in mid-air again as it
  fell but was unable to succeed this time and it fell to the floor below with a few
  soft clangs, followed by Olivia's giggle.
- Later...
- The TARDIS shuddered violently, making every stumble and shout in surprise before
  the Doctor shoved something back into place to correct the ship.
- A knock on the door made everyone frown around at each other before Olivia and Joyce
  headed toward the door.
- Olivia's chin fell slightly as she opened her door and stepped into her room, not
  saying anything and making Aaron frown at her in wonder as he followed her in and
  shut the door behind him.
- She couldn't help but giggle as he led her toward the door, her bag in hand.
- ! 'Chapter 7: Siren'
- A beeping came from the scanner, making all of them crowd around it, the Doctor
  in the center.
- In the Captain's Cabin...
- Olivia swallowed when Avery cocked his gun and aimed it at the Doctor's face.
- They climbed out of the hatch and snuck back toward the group as the Doctor still
  stood on the plank.
- She was cut off when a beautiful voice suddenly filled the air around them, making
  them all look around for the source.
- The Siren shrieked, turning red and baring her teeth and sending Amy flying across
  the deck before she returned to normal and began her song again.
- Avery grabbed onto Olivia's arm as the Doctor handed her to the captain and she
  struggled against him.
- Olivia went into another fit of giggles but whether it was from what he'd said or
  from being under the influence of the Siren he had no idea.
- One of the men shouted in pain as he lifted his leg from the bilge water around
  them, something attached to his shin.
- He looked to his hand warily before showing off the black spot on his palm to everyone
  else.
- As if on cue the Siren appeared behind him, singing and making the Doctor shout
  in surprise as he turned to her, holding Olivia back as she instantly tried to reach
  out to touch her.
- Once they reached the door the first mate searched the keys on his belt, but was
  taking too long for everyone's comfort.
- He sat him down on one of the benches the boy, Toby, had made for a bed and sat
  a foot away from him as Olivia looked around with a frown, starting to come to her
  senses, but the Doctor still held onto her.
- Avery thought for a moment before pulling the pendant he wore from around his neck
  to hang it on Toby's.
- Without a word she pressed her lips to his and savored the short, tender kiss before
  they pulled away and he turned to head out the door after Avery, heading for the
  TARDIS to get them all out of here.
- ! 'Chapter 8: Medics'
- Olivia smirked before looking to the sailors at the door removing the barricade
  of barrels from it.
- Toby glared at him before turning to run into the room, making Amy and Rory frown
  at him, but Olivia kept her glare on the two sailors.
- Toby moved forward and cut the first mate's hand, making him stare at it in panic
  before turning his hand over to see the Black Spot on his palm.
- Mulligan said nothing as he turned and marched out the door.
- It wasn't long before the Doctor and Avery returned and explained everything they'd
  seen and learned, the Doctor telling them their plan.
- Later...
- Olivia woke to the sound of thunder, making her shoot up to sit upright just as
  the ship rocked and she slid into one of the barrels.
- Rory and Toby hurried after them and when the Doctor dragged Olivia out into the
  rain, she couldn't help but grin and stop on deck to stand in the pouring rain,
  instantly soaked.
- Toby disappeared in a plume of smoke as Amy kept Rory at bay…but Olivia was still
  heading toward her as the Siren still sang, now singing to her.
- On the Other Side...
- She struggled to stand as she looked around, but when she looked ahead her eyes
  widened at the sight of the ship she'd been on, the storm raging on and she could
  see everyone on deck…except Rory.
- The couple finally came up for air and Olivia couldn't help but grin, making him
  grin in return.
- An alarm caught their attention, making them turn into the ship and cautiously head
  deeper into it.
- The Doctor stepped toward Rory and Amy to scan him with his Sonic.
- The Doctor moved to take the thing around Rory's neck off, but they stopped when
  the monitor started beeping faster and they heard the Siren's Song.
- The Siren raised a hand over Toby, still singing, causing Avery step out from behind
  the tarp, drawing his gun.
- Amy moved to take the collar off Rory, but the Siren shrieked at her, quickly phasing
  from red then back to green.
- A tear ran down Amy's cheek before the Siren lifted her hand and a ring of light
  formed around it, making Amy frown.
- Olivia sniffled as the Doctor pulled her toward Avery who still stood next to Toby.
- The Doctor only shook his head in apology.
- Encouraged, Amy tried again before begging him to wake up then finally giving way
  to sobs.
- Later...
- Olivia tapped his shoulder with hers as they left, but he didn't look at her.
- ! 'Chapter 9: House'
- The TARDIS console suddenly sparked as the ship jostled, violently.
- Amy and Olivia screamed when the console sparked again and they were all thrown
  around the TARDIS until it finally came to a stop and they regained their footing.
- The lights in the TARDIS suddenly and slowly dimmed.
- They all turned to the sound of the unfamiliar voice to see a woman with unruly
  dark hair in Victorian style dress pointing at the Doctor as two other people hobbled
  after her.
- Olivia and the Doctor frowned at each other in wonder before Olivia looked to Amy
  and Rory in confusion but no one said a word.
- Her legs instantly came out from under her, making everyone grab a limb on her to
  set her down on a makeshift bed in the nearby pile of junk.
- Amy and Rory turned, making Amy gasp when they stared at the bald headed, tentacle
  mouthed alien with a ball in his hand.
- Olivia stepped up next to the Doctor to look over his shoulder as the Ood nodded
  and he took the ball from its hand to pull it apart.
- He turned and took Olivia's hand to head after Auntie and Uncle, Amy and Rory following
  after them until they were in a room made of junk, a glowing green vent on the far
  side of it.
- The Doctor and Olivia jumped back when a deep, unfamiliar voice came from Auntie
  and Uncle as they spoke together.
- Olivia groaned at the ebbing pain in her head, making the Doctor pull his hand from
  hers to wrap it around her shoulders and hold her up as they walked toward Amy and
  Rory.
- Olivia swallowed when she noticed one of Auntie's hands looked a lot bigger and
  far more manly than the other as she touched Amy's face before she tucked it back
  into her sleeve.
- The Doctor led the three through the halls, but stopped when a sound caught his
  ear, making him stop and shush the others to listen.
- Olivia frowned up at him before her phone rang in her pocket and she pulled it out
  to answer it.
- Olivia pulled her phone out when it rang as Uncle retreated and answered it.
- Amy was cut off when Olivia hung up the phone.
- ! 'Chapter 10: TARDIS'
- She moved her mouth and she made a familiar sound, making Olivia's eyes widen at
  her in absolute disbelief.
- The Doctor tried his Sonic on the door, and she instantly pulled out her Sonic to
  try it on the door as well as he snapped his fingers.
- She ran toward the exit but stopped, shouting in pain and grabbing her stomach.
- Olivia watched him run off somewhere as she and Idris remained on the hill before
  she turned to her to ask a question.
- Olivia glanced at the Doctor rummaging through a pile of spare parts before stepping
  closer to Idris.
- Olivia swallowed, tears welling in her eyes and her stomach turned, not just from
  the rift energy around her now, but because of the subject of their conversation.
- The three worked, Idris easily finding the things they needed and the Doctor telling
  Olivia what to do until she looked ready to be sick again, then he told her to sit
  and rest while he worked.
- Olivia's eyes widened at Idris who smiled, warmly making Olivia grin back.
- Olivia remained silent as Idris and the Doctor worked, and she did what she could
  to help a little longer until she was standing at the nearly completed console where
  the Doctor had asked for her help.
- The console sparked, making the three jump with a start.
- ! 'Chapter 11: Return'
- She was tossed back again but gripped the console as the Doctor came up between
  them to look into the mirror as well.
- She spoke to Rory again as the two worked on the console, and Olivia looked ahead
  with a grin.
- Olivia's laughter howled even harder through the room as the Doctor groaned and
  turned to Amy.
- They all grabbed at their throats out of reflex when the air rushed from the room,
  making them gasp for breath.
- A bright light shone brightly above them, blinding them, and a second later…they
  were in the main control room.
- He began clapping, urging Olivia to do the same as she stood with him and she frowned
  at him in absolute confusion before beginning to clap.
- They all stared in awe as the lights dazzled around the room, House objecting and
  sounding as though he were struggling.
- Olivia felt tears gathered in her eyes as Idris shuddered from crying, but kept
  a smile as he Doctor reached for Olivia's hand and she gripped it tightly without
  a word.
- Later...
- Brilliant sparks went off around him when Rory touched a circuit.
- Olivia couldn't help but smile when his case was met with frowns from the two.
- Olivia hid her sad smile as she stroked the console, not saying a word.
- The launching lever moved on its own and the engines came alive, making them both
  grin before the Doctor ran around the console excitedly.
- Later...
- Olivia grinned as she looked around the room that was designed exactly like her
  room at her mother's house in Los Angeles…but with bunk beds.
- When she came out of the shower fifteen minutes later in a fluffy purple robe, rubbing
  her hair dry with a towel, she couldn't help but giggle when she found the Doctor
  lying on his back in the bottom bunk.
- ! 'Chapter 12: Flesh'
- She and the Doctor operated the console, Amy and Rory stumbling around them.
- The Doctor grabbed Olivia's hand and walked her back with Amy and Rory, letting
  Dicken scan them.
- Olivia watched the Doctor closely, seeing the wheels turning in his head but noticing
  that he was anxious as they did.
- Jennifer turned to head out of the room as Olivia watched the Doctor pull his Sonic
  out and aim it at the Flesh.
- He lifted a hand over it and lowered it to the surface of the Flesh, struggling
  to hold it there.
- The Doctor groaned, his face tightening in pain as he held his hand on its surface,
  everyone watching him before he yanked his hand away, taking a step back.
- Thunder crashed outside as the Doctor pulled out the little snow globe again to
  examine it while the whole building shook.
- Jennifer hesitated when he pointed to her, making him ask her again.
- Her head jerked when something hit the back of it, hard and she fell forward onto
  the Doctor, unconscious.
- ! 'Chapter 13: Gangers'
- It was louder now, and she felt as if she were being shaken.
- She groaned and the shaking stopped as her eyes fluttered open, making her frown
  against the shifting sunlight above her.
- Olivia held out her hand to let him drop the pill into her palm then tossed it into
  her mouth, swallowing it as he took both her hands and stood.
- He took her hand and dragged her toward the stairs, and she was thankful her head
  was starting to feel better as they hurried down a set of stairs.
- He led them down the hall again until they reached the harness room where Amy and
  Rory had found everyone else.
- Music suddenly began playing, making everyone freeze and stare at each other in
  confusion.
- Cleaves cut herself off as the music continued then led everyone through the building
  to the dining hall which was a mess as they saw when they stepped inside.
- Jennifer suddenly gasped, making the Doctor and Olivia look to her as Rory stepped
  toward her.
- Olivia straightened as she watched her march out of the room.
- Olivia stared at the sink Jennifer had been standing at with a wide-eyed frown of
  wonder as Rory stepped next to her.
- He turned to Amy to stare at her and Olivia frowned in wonder at the look in his
  eyes, almost as if he didn't know what to make of her.
- He grabbed Olivia's hand and bolted back up the stairs, Amy and Jimmy following
  them.
- The Doctor didn't answer as he led them through the building, still gripping Olivia's
  hand, and she rubbed her thumb over her Psychic Band to find their link.
- They turned into a hallway, but stopped with a shout when steam blew from a pipe
  on the wall, making them back away to stare down at the acid puddle on the floor.
- The Doctor pulled her away but had to go back as Jimmy pulled a box of distress
  flares from the wall they'd passed.
- She swallowed before nodding, lowering her gaze which he quickly brought back up
  to meet his by pulling her chin up, gently.
- Ganger Cleaves stared at her for a moment before giving a nod, making the Doctor
  grin and clap his hands.
- They managed to form their faces properly and he took Olivia's hand to lead her
  up the stairs, followed by the Gangers.
- He stopped at the table as the crew stared at their Gangers in wide-eyed shock.
- He took the shoes and put them on before sitting in one of the chairs, Olivia kneeling
  to tie them as he spoke.
- No one objected, or said a word.
- Buzzer rushed toward Cleaves, making her aim the weapon at him and she zapped him
  with it three times, making him stop dead and seize as he fell to the floor.
- Cleaves looked away from Olivia to look at Jennifer and Olivia pounced, wrestling
  Cleaves to the ground and unplugging the probe as she struggled.
- ! 'Chapter 14: Doctors'
- The Doctor, Olivia and Amy looked to the room as the crew barricaded the door.
- Olivia gasped and ducked behind the Doctor when Ganger Doctor stepped into the light
  to reveal his face, unformed and white.
- She tried to hold onto the Doctor's arm when he slowly approached his Ganger.
- Ganger Doctor gasped in pain before reaching for the Doctor.
- He gasped and looked up at her with wide eyes, making her jump but she didn't back
  away.
- Ganger Doctor planted a kiss to her cheek before releasing her and as she passed
  the Doctor, he stopped her and pressed a kiss to her cheek as well before she made
  her way toward Amy.
- She turned to head toward the Doctor and his Ganger to find them standing side by
  side.
- Both Doctor's headed toward them, one of them grabbing Olivia's hand to pull her
  with them.
- The three frowned at Olivia when she grabbed the left hand on the Doctor still holding
  one of hers and examined it.
- Olivia gave a slight cough from the steam flowing around them.
- They all started coughing, choking on the air around them.
- Olivia let the Ganger Doctor's hand go so he could run toward the computers and
  work on them with the Doctor as a bell tolled.
- All they got was warbled feedback, making her shake her head.
- Olivia frowned at her and opened her mouth to object, but the Doctor threw an arm
  around her to cover her mouth with one hand as he made eye contact with his Ganger.
- The Doctor lowered his hand from Olivia's mouth as his Ganger stepped toward the
  center of the room to pace.
- ! 'Chapter 15: Real'
- Olivia stepped around the panel to head toward the Ganger Doctor, standing next
  to him as Amy scooted closer to the Doctor to watch him work on the panel.
- Amy moved her chair to look at his Ganger as he stood with Olivia, stoic and very
  not like the Doctor.
- She hurried toward the Doctor as Olivia frowned between all of them then looked
  to Ganger Doctor in wonder as they all listened.
- Olivia's frown deepened before she looked to the door when it was flung open and
  Amy stumbled in.
- She gritted her teeth, folding her arms in front of her as her nostrils flared.
- Olivia watched the Doctor use his Sonic on Cleaves as the foreman sat next to him
  rubbing her head with a frown before Amy marched out from behind the panel.
- He took Olivia's hand and pulled her out the door, Buzzer right behind them.
- The building shook, cutting her off as they were tossed to one side, hitting the
  wall and groaning in pain.
- The building thrashed again, making them stumble as they tried to head down the
  hall, but this time they went at a run, the Doctor holding onto Olivia's hand, tightly.
- She screamed and jerked back when Buzzer used his flashlight to hit the Doctor over
  the head, knocking him out and she stared wide eyes at him in angry confusion.
- Before they could respond the Doctor shifted and groaned, opening his eyes wide
  and looking up at her.
- She frowned in utter confusion but before she could question him he stood tall,
  pulling her with him and shoving her away from him as Gangers Jimmy and Dicken remained
  behind him.
- Olivia said nothing as her heart raced in panic and they both turned glaresto the
  Gangers.
- The telephone in the room suddenly rang, making everyone frown in wonder.
- They all watched him march toward the phone, and use his Sonic on it before a hologram
  of a little boy in his pajamas came up.
- Ganger Jimmy turned and bolted out of the room.
- Jennifer only rolled her eyes and turned to march out, making Olivia sigh in exasperation
  before looking back to Ganger Doctor.
- ! 'Chapter 16: Amelia'
- Olivia ran in and started operating the console as Dicken ran in, soon followed
  by Cleaves.
- Amy stared at her for a moment, taking everything in before looking to Ganger Doctor
  and hurrying toward him, hugging him tightly as he hugged her in return.
- Olivia frowned when they let each other go and the wall shook again when Jennifer
  slammed against it.
- She stared at him before turning to Ganger Doctor and hugging him tightly as the
  Doctor still spoke to his Ganger.
- He tossed his Sonic to Ganger Doctor, which he caught with one hand as Olivia still
  clung to him.
- Olivia and the Doctor ran toward the console to dematerialize out of the factory,
  and Amy stepped toward Olivia as she worked.
- He looked at her and instantly came back to his senses.
- A Beach in Scotland...
- Amy suddenly doubled over in pain, making Rory and Olivia step closer to her and
  Rory looked to the Doctor.
- She took his arm as Rory glanced between them, realizing she was right and letting
  her pull him back from Amy, slowly.
- Olivia looked to the Doctor and saw his own pain as he lowered the Sonic and turned
  to the console, slamming a lever down and starting up the TARDIS.
- Somewhere in Deep Space...
- The ship thrashed, making the Cyberman holding her stumble and release her, and
  she shoved it away.
- Olivia ran for the door as the ship thrashed again, and she pulled her Sonic Screwdriver
  from her jacket as she ran.
- The door slid open and to reveal Rory in his Centurion armor as Olivia stepped back
  when he marched in, the Cybermen aiming their guns at him.
- The Cybermen were silent as they stood with their guns still drawn on him.
- Olivia aimed her Sonic at the Cyberman and made a shooting sound, imitating the
  recoil of a gun as the Cyberlegion outside…exploded, ship by ship.
- In the TARDIS...
- The TARDIS thrashed once, making Olivia roll her eyes and sigh before flipping some
  switches and the ride smoothed.
- A loud explosion went off outside, making the TARDIS shudder before Olivia turned
  a wide-eyed stare at the Doctor.
- Olivia frowned when River said nothing and looked astonished to see them.
- Olivia swallowed as Rory frowned in wonder but said nothing for a moment before
  Olivia broke the silence.
- ! 'Chapter 17: Melody'
- The three monks on the platform with him stepped to center stage as Colonel Manton
  stepped to one side.
- He stepped back down the platform to the monk on the far right.
- All the Clerics cocked and aimed their guns at him, the Headless Monks readying
  their swords that were charged with electricity.
- The monks ignited their swords, causing the Cleric to shoot him.
- Manton looked around the room to see his Clerics surrounded by Silurians and the
  Judoon, appearing from nowhere.
- Manton dove for it, shoving it into his gun but Olivia aimed her Sonic at it, making
  it spark and he cried out in pain as it fell from his hand.
- She turned and led the way to the control room, Strax keeping his weapon aimed at
  Manton's back.
- Olivia shot her gaze to the door to see a woman in a black pantsuit with an eye
  patch, guarded by two Silurians.
- Olivia watched carefully as the Doctor stepped toward her.
- The Doctor smirked at her before stepping away to take Olivia's hand and pull her
  back down the hall.
- Olivia pulled him through the door this time and headed down the stairs to hug Amy
  as the Doctor grinned down at the baby in Rory's arms.
- She made a little sound, making Olivia giggle.
- They all laughed as Melody made another little noise.
- Olivia nodded as Amy came up behind her and the Doctor helped her step up into the
  TARDIS as Rory remained outside as well.
- They turned back to the TARDIS when they heard Melody crying and Amy came back out,
  shushing her and trying to calm her.
- The Doctor watched Olivia with Melody, making her frown up at him and meet his fond
  gaze.
- Olivia's eyes shot wide and she wanted to hug him so tightly but she only grinned
  instead, and Amy continued her questioning since she hadn't heard him.
- Amy and Olivia giggled as he touched his hair before Amy continued.
- He took Olivia's hand and pulled her with him as he was about to head to the main
  control room but Amy followed them.
- He turned and this time made it to the hall leading to the main control room.
- Olivia hugged his chest and he hugged her in return before Vastra continued.
- ! 'Chapter 18: Human'
- The Doctor stared at the screen as Olivia frowned in wonder before her eyes widened
  in realization as she shot her gaze to him.
- Demons run when a good man goes to war
- Night will fall and drown the sun when a good man goes to war
- Friendship dies and true love lies
- Night will fall and the dark will rise when a good man goes to war
- Demons run, but count the cost
- The battle's won, but the child is lost
- Strax moaned in pain, leaning against a crate and Rory went to him to kneel next
  to him and examine his wounds
- Olivia looked to him, seeing the pain in his expression at Amy's rejection of his
  attempt at comforting her, the lump in her throat growing until she felt she couldn't
  breathe.
- Her head tilted to the side as her eyes slowly closed, letting out her last breath
  and Olivia couldn't stop the tears that flowed down her cheeks as the Doctor looked
  up at Vastra.
- He swallowed before throwing his arms around her to hug her tightly and she pulled
  him close in return as he buried his face into the crook of her neck.
- A bright light filled the room from behind him as thunder crashed, making her look
  over his shoulder but he didn't move or release her as her eyes widened at who she
  saw.
- Olivia slowly stepped toward River when the Doctor strolled closer to her as well
  until he stopped to loom over her, staring her down.
- He made kissing faces at her as Olivia couldn't help but giggle.
- He took Olivia's hand and pulled her toward the TARDIS, using the Sonic to lower
  the forcefield that had been placed around it as they ran after him.
- The Doctor stepped up behind her to wrap his arms around her waist as she still
  hung onto the scanner, looking it over, his chin on her shoulder.
- Olivia nodded before lifting her head to look up at him and he smiled, warmly as
  he lifted a hand to stroke her cheek.
- Olivia bit her lip as she took in his words and she nodded in understanding.
- Three Months Later...
- The Doctor frowned at the screen and gave a groan when he saw its screen before
  hurrying around the console again.
- He slammed a lever down and the TARDIS jostled, making Olivia laugh, excitedly.
- ! 'Chapter 19: Mels'
- Olivia sighed as she stepped out of the TARDIS and into a huge crop circle in a
  field of wheat, the Doctor right behind her and he held up a newspaper as Amy and
  Rory climbed out of their car, having just made the crop circle.
- Olivia examined the picture of the crop circle with a line through 'Doct,' stopping
  at the second 'O' where they were.
- Olivia frowned at him as they operated the TARDIS and Mels looked to her gun while
  Amy and Rory frowned at him as well.
- He placed a finger over his lips, making her roll her eyes at him.
- They all hurried to the door, not caring where they'd ended up, and only caring
  about getting away from the smoke filling the room.
- Mels marched away from them, rolling her eyes as Rory and Amy hurried toward the
  man they finally noticed lying on the floor.
- Olivia and Rory looked to the Doctor as he and Amy stared at Hitler in disbelief.
- Olivia stepped toward Mels had an arm wrapped around her stomach as Hitler reminded
  Rory of his rank but Rory only shut the door in Hitler's face as the Doctor stepped
  toward the other man to question him, but he only fainted.
- Everyone's eyes shot wide as Olivia looked to the Doctor in realization, and he
  only glanced between Amy and Rory when they looked to him in wonder.
- She jumped just as Mels jerked her head forward with a gasp and shuddered…but she
  didn't look like Mels anymore.
- She lifted her hands to her head to feel at her outrageously curly hair.
- Olivia shot her gaze to the Doctor as he took a step toward them, but began sinking
  to the floor, making Amy and Rory help him stand.
- ! 'Chapter 20: River'
- She stood and a burst of energy launched the men to the ground as Olivia covered
  her face, but was soon dragged to her feet by River, the men scattered around them,
  unconscious.
- River glanced at Olivia in the mirror as she only sat at the table.
- River said nothing as she tossed the hat away and lifted something else from her
  pile to try on.
- River sighed before tossing away the thing she'd tried on and placing her hands
  on her hips as she looked Olivia in the eye.
- Amy moved, almost robotically around, River to look at her face to face, making
  Olivia's frown fall as she reached into her jacket for her Sonic Screwdriver, but
  she only watched for the moment.
- Olivia froze and they all whirled around to see the Doctor in a tuxedo and top hat
  leaning back against his TARDIS with a cane in front of him.
- He grabbed Olivia's hand and pulled her toward Amy and River to stand in front of
  Amy and examine her.
- Olivia giggled before glancing at River, who was eyeing an exit.
- He suddenly shouted in pain and fell to the floor, making Olivia hurry toward him
  to try helping him up.
- Amy's mouth closed but River was suspended in light as she looked back at them with
  a blank expression.
- Olivia's eyes widened before she looked to the Doctor, his casual smile falling
  as he glared up at the robot.
- A moment later River was released but before she fell completely to the floor, Olivia
  shot toward her and caught her.
- Olivia hurried toward him, letting River sit in one of the chairs at one of the
  tables as she knelt in front of the Doctor.
- He tried to lift his foot but he stumbled over the stair, sending them both tumbling
  onto the stairs as Amy cried for help.
- Olivia's foot slid out from under her and she landed on the top stairs, bouncing
  down to the next one and crying out in pain as the Doctor growled in anger at River's
  request.
- It was a lie, but she needed River's cooperation…to help herself.
- He nodded with a slight smirk before lifting a hand to beckon her closer and she
  leaned forward to let him press a kiss to her lips.
- Olivia's smile fell as River came out from behind the console, making the couples'
  eyes widen at her.
- Amy bowed her head before she and Rory stood and Olivia moved to stand as well,
  but he gripped her wrist, making her frown down at him.
- The robot's image changed to reveal River Song and Olivia looked to the real River
  to see her eyes welling with tears as she saw herself and realized she was River
  all along.
- Olivia saw something change in River as she looked down at the Doctor, then saw
  her hands glow again, making her frown, taking a step back toward Amy and Rory.
- They watched River's hands glow brightly as she knelt next to him and placed her
  hands on his face, making his eyes shoot open as he gasped.
- Later...
- Olivia hugged the Doctor's arm as they stood in River's hospital room, Amy and Rory
  on the other side of her bed just as she awoke.
- Back in the TARDIS...
- He looked to the scanner, making Olivia frown at him and she quietly approached
  him to try seeing what was on the screen.
- She cut him off when she punched his other arm.
- He gripped her wrists and shoved them onto the wall on either side of her head as
  she stared up at him with wide eyes and he loomed over her.
- Olivia's breath hitched and he recognized the terror in her eyes making him frown
  down at her in wonder.
- He watched her in confusion as she ducked under his arm and hurried back toward
  the control room.
- ! 'Chapter 21: Cupboard'
- The Doctor shoved the scanner away, finally making Olivia glare at him.
- Rory nodded before glancing to the Doctor as he looked at the scanner as Amy stood
  with him.
- Rory was the first to head out, followed by Amy, but the Doctor gripped Olivia's
  arm before she could head out of the TARDIS, making her look up at him with a frown.
- They walked toward the lifts as Amy and Rory followed Olivia and the Doctor.
- He pulled Olivia into the lift with him, Amy and Rory following them in.
- He smiled at her, but they both turned to the door when it opened to reveal an elderly
  woman on the other side of it.
- The door was slammed in their faces and Olivia sighed, tiredly before they turned
  to head toward the next door.
- Some time later...
- She frowned at him before following his gaze, seeing Amy and Rory on the floor below
  them, and a little boy peeking out of the curtains covering his windows.
- Olivia frowned in wonder at how he knew his name as Alex shut the front door, then
  noticed a door with a child's drawing on it with the words 'George's Room' written
  on it.
- He helped her flip through the book to the pages with George in them.
- She only nodded as she looked through the pictures.
- There was a crash from his room, causing all three of them to shoot to their feet
  and hurry toward the door, Alex in the lead.
- George gasped, his already wide eyes shooting wider and making the Doctor frown
  as he stood to step next to Olivia who was also frowning at him.
- The Doctor pointed his Sonic at the toys scattered across the room, and one by one,
  robots and cars came to life, moving around the floor.
- He nodded and took the Sonic to examine it, carefully.
- Olivia frowned at him in wonder, however she couldn't help but smile as she looked
  up at him.
- The Sonic made a strange sound, making Olivia frown up at him as she remained on
  the bed with George.
- He stepped toward the cupboard to open it.
- George nodded and Olivia smiled warmly before heading out the door and into the
  kitchen where the Doctor was looking through the cabinets.
- The Doctor opened the door again, making Alex shut it again.
- Olivia bit her lower lip, staring at the Doctor as he stared at Alex who stared
  back at him.
- Later...
- Alex choked on his tea as Olivia frowned up at the Doctor in confusion.
- ! 'Chapter 22: Tenza'
- She nodded and hurried out of the room to get the photo album, opening it to look
  through it, frowning at it in wonder when it suddenly hit her as well.
- Olivia's eyes widened at him before she looked to George now sitting on his bed
  and she sat next to him.
- They both looked to George as he sat on the bed, staring up at them.
- In the Cupboard...
- Olivia groaned as she awoke lying on her back in a dark room.
- Alex and Olivia followed right behind the Doctor.
- He handed the fruit to Alex before grabbing Olivia's hand and dragging her down
  the halls of the house, Alex dumping the load in his arms and heading after them.
- Olivia and Alex listened to the familiar sound fill the room.
- The Doctor stepped toward a corner as Alex noticed the electric candles in the room
  and watched them, Olivia stepping toward the Doctor.
- Olivia frowned and the three turned to see a tall, scary-looking doll standing in
  the doorway.
- Olivia opened the door to reveal more dolls behind it making her shut it again and
  shake her head at the Doctor who ran to another door.
- The Doctor stepped closer to protect her as Alex kept the dolls coming up the stairs
  at bay and Olivia closed her eyes to concentrate.
- The dolls were closing in on them, pushing the four of them together and just when
  they all thought they were goners, the dolls froze, making them all look around
  before looking to the bottom of the stairs and Olivia sighed in relief.
- Olivia noticed the dolls' head's turn to him as they began heading down the stairs.
- George shook his head and Olivia turned to the Doctor, at a loss.
- Back in the Flat...
- Olivia grinned at George but once the family was distracted with each other, the
  Doctor grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the door, making her frown at him
  but he just marched on, heading onto the balcony to head toward the lift.
- Olivia smiled when she saw George behind Alex and waved at him before releasing
  the Doctor's arm and kneeling in front of him, reaching into her jacket pocket.
- George nodded with a grin as he took the Sonic.
- She looked to him with a frown before it fell to a smile and she nodded, pressing
  a kiss to his cheek just as the lift stopped and they stepped out to meet Amy and
  Rory in the courtyard.
- The Doctor watched them head up the stairs to head for the kitchen then looked to
  Olivia and made his way to her around the console.
- He smiled warmly at her before nodding and stepping close to wrap an arm around
  her waist and pressed a kiss to her cheek.
- The Doctor smirked and pulled the scanner in front of them, making her frown in
  wonder before he flipped a switch and the screen showed a list of names of all kinds.
- Later...
- She nodded.
- Olivia giggled again before shifting her head to press a kiss to his lips.
- Olivia grinned as she snuggled against him again, closing her eyes to fall asleep
  to the sound of his hearts.
- ! 'Chapter 23: Timestreams'
- He opened the door to reveal sterile, white surroundings and—
- They both headed out the door, Olivia shutting the door behind them as Amy knocked
  on the door the men had gone through.
- The door slid open to reveal a room with a glass table, three chairs and a huge
  magnifying glass standing on the table.
- Olivia pulled out her Sonic Screwdriver and ran it over the edge of the door to
  open it but it remained shut, making her frown before she looked to her Sonic.
- Olivia, the Doctor and Amy looked around the glass, but Olivia and Amy didn't see
  the Doctor on the other side as they thought they would.
- The screen blipped off, making the girls stare at it in growing panic.
- Amy nodded as Olivia began twirling her Psychic Band on her left ring finger, closing
  her eyes to concentrate on finding him.
- A Week Later...
- Amy squatted in a corner as Olivia rested her head on the table where she sat in
  front of the magnifying glass.
- A moment later the image returned to normal.
- The Doctor grabbed the lapel of his coat and covered his face, making Rory do the
  same with his jacket as Amy and Olivia covered their noses and mouths with their
  hands.
- The Hanbot disappeared and the girls lowered their hands from their mouths when
  they saw the Doctor and Rory lower their jackets.
- Amy and Olivia glanced at each other in thought before Amy answered.
- The Doctor lifted the glass from its stand, making it completely disappear in front
  of Amy and Olivia.
- An alarm suddenly blared, making both girls shake their heads in exasperation.
- The doors closed, truly separating them from the ones they loved.
- In the TARDIS...
- He plugged something in and the console sparked before he hurried toward a drawer
  of the console to rummage through it.
- The Doctor began flying the TARDIS and looked up, expecting to see Olivia helping
  him, but both his hearts sank when he recalled where she was.
- Meanwhile in Two Streams...
- They were suddenly stopped by a bright light aimed at them from the ceiling.
- The panel on its chest came down to reveal a syringe-like device.
- Olivia pressed one of the buttons as Amy came up to her.
- Interface remained silent still.
- They hurried out of the garden and through the facility until they reached the door
  Interface had showed them with the temporal engines behind them.
- She opened the door and hurried inside to find Amy.
- ! 'Chapter 24: Waiting'
- Rory held tightly to the timeglass as he stepped out of the TARDIS door, the Doctor
  remaining at the console to watch the Rorycam.
- Rory obeyed and looked through the glass to see ghostly figures passing through
  it, their voices overlapping.
- Rory lowered the glass to find a sword coming at his face, a figure in battle clothes
  behind it.
- Both figures froze, the one with the sword still pointing it at him, the one with
  the stick loosening its grip.
- Amy lifted her sword, making Rory lift his hands in surrender.
- Amy marched toward the exit, Rory hurrying after her with Olivia following.
- Olivia hurried through the doors to head toward her's and Amy's hiding place in
  the temporal engines, finding Rory examining the Handless Handbot named Rory.
- Olivia gave a small laugh as she passed Rory who hurried to catch up with her.
- The girls led Rory to the garden, stopping under an awning before Amy spoke.
- The three of them laughed, making Amy look to Rory as Olivia took that as her cue
  to head toward the steps leading to the trail through the garden.
- Olivia headed down the trail, Rory following after her.
- Rory smacked into the invisible wall on one side of the door, making Olivia give
  a small giggle before she turned.
- Olivia smirked at the scene, seeing the old Amy coming back.
- She turned to head into the doorway, Olivia and Rory right behind her.
- Olivia pushed through the doors, Rory right behind her to catch up with Amy.
- Amy marched through the overhanging drapes, and Olivia wasted no time before she
  followed her.
- Amy frowned at Olivia in disbelief, but Olivia continued.
- Amy glared at Olivia just as Rory entered and Olivia turned to march out of the
  hiding place to pace outside.
- She was brought out her mind when Rory stepped up next to her, making her frown
  in wonder.
- Olivia nodded in understanding, pacing in front of Rory as he watched her.
- Olivia could hear it in his voice, and she knew it through her studies and her own
  experience…it couldn't be done.
- Rory obeyed before tossing it back to Amy.
- Rory started throwing the levers as the girls started thinking.
- Rory came up behind Amy and hugged her as the Olivias only smiled at each other
  in wonder before Rory let Amy go and older Amy cleared her throat.
- Rory's glasses sparked as feedback sounded from them.
- The glasses sparked again and Rory looked to the four girls.
- ! 'Chapter 25: Death'
- Olivia Two opened the door of the TARDIS to let Rory carry Amy Two inside, laying
  her on the floor as the Doctor hurried toward them to place his long coat over Amy
  and look her over.
- Rory looked up at the window when he saw Amy's hand come up and rest on the glass.
- Olivia stepped up next to the Doctor at the console and before she could say a word,
  he turned to her and threw his arms around her, pulling her close.
- He pulled her through a door and she gasped when he threw his arms around her again,
  giving her no time to see what room they were in as he held her tightly, pinning
  himself between her and the wall next to the door.
- Olivia sighed in realization, hugging him tighter and nuzzling her face into his
  shoulder.
- Later...
- Olivia giggled as she looked at the screen of the scanner in the control room of
  the TARDIS.
- The Doctor strolled down the stairs to the control room, frowning when he saw Olivia
  on the other side, focusing on the scanner.
- The screen blipped on by itself, making Olivia stare at it with wide eyes as the
  Doctor stepped in front of it to look at it.
- The screen changed to the previous picture to show a little girl with black curls
  and big blue eyes, resembling Olivia very much.
- Olivia shuddered, stepping toward the Doctor as he watched Amy and Rory.
- Olivia rang the bell on the front desk in the lobby, and the ring was followed by
  a shout as three people ran out from the hallway, a young man with glasses and a
  woman in scrubs armed, an odd looking man waving a white handkerchief.
- Amy couldn't help but laugh as the Doctor opened the doors to reveal a wall behind
  them.
- He stepped toward Olivia to grab her hand and pull her up the stairs.
- They stopped when they reached the spot where the TARDIS had been only to find that
  it was gone.
- The music Olivia had shut off started again, making her look to the Doctor as he
  looked around the stairs.
- ! 'Chapter 26: Fear'
- He laughed and all the dummies around him laughed as well, making Olivia stare around
  the room in horror before it died.
- The Doctor nodded before patting Olivia's leg, making her stand to let him do the
  sane and grab the dolly on one side of the room, wheeling it toward him and tucking
  it under his chair.
- Olivia nodded as the Doctor lifted Joe with the dolly and wheeled after her, the
  group following them to the lobby.
- Joe suddenly started laughing manically as he sat on the other side of the desk,
  still tied to his chair.
- In the Halls...
- The Doctor led the group as they all wandered around, Gibbis wheeling Joe still
  tied up and his mouth now duct-taped shut.
- Olivia clenched the Doctor's hand tightly as they strolled, making him frown down
  at her as he felt her anxiety.
- He couldn't help but smile warmly as he pulled his hand from hers and wrapped it
  around her shoulders to pull her close.
- The man stepped back into the room and the Doctor shook his head in confusion as
  Olivia turned around to make sure everyone was together.
- They all laughed and Howie stared around at them in panic.
- Olivia froze, her eyes shooting wide as she slowly turned to look at what she knew
  was behind her in terror.
- She stumbled back as the door swung open then slammed shut in front of her and a
  pair of arms wrapped around her to pull her close, a bowtie brushing against her
  forehead as she buried her face into the chest she turned into.
- Dining Hall...
- Olivia watched the Doctor as he scanned Joe's body and the ventriloquist dummies
  with his Sonic, then watched Rory and Howie barricade the door before eyeing Gibbis
  sitting at a table by himself, Amy sitting on the bar adjacent to him.
- Olivia smiled at Amy and was about to stand from her seat to head toward the Doctor
  but stopped short when she noticed Rita set the tray she was carrying on the table
  Olivia was sitting at and set a cup of tea in front of her.
- Amy laughed before sitting on the edge of the table next to Olivia and Rory sat
  in the chair she'd been in.
- Olivia froze as she looked up at Amy then sighed as she set her cup on the table.
- Rory placed a comforting hand on Olivia's shoulder when she took in a deep breath,
  patting his knee in thanks.
- The Doctor looked at her in wonder as Olivia frowned before she answered.
- The Doctor took a drink of his tea and threw his head back to gargle it, making
  Olivia try to stifle a snicker in vain.
- She smiled and opened her mouth to reply—
- He took the papers and tapped her head with them, making her chuckle before he grabbed
  Olivia's hand and pulled her under his arm, reading the papers.
- The Doctor stepped away and Olivia leaned down next to Gibbis' ear, still gripping
  his shoulders.
- The Doctor sat in one of the chairs, pulling another up right next to him for Olivia
  to sit in it, Amy, Rita and Rory crowding around to watch them.
- The Doctor stood, making everyone follow him as they huddled away from Howie while
  he sat giggling giddily in his seat.
- ! 'Chapter 27: Praises'
- He was about to slip the mop through the door handle to barricade it but Olivia
  flung the door open and stepped in ahead of him.
- She shoved Rory out and didn't move from the door until she heard Rory shove the
  mop through the slot then turned to the room, only to gasp when the Doctor stood,
  looming over her.
- The thing growled as the Doctor and Olivia stepped out from their hiding place,
  the strategically placed mirrors confusing it as to where they were.
- The Minotaur growled again as Olivia swallowed, her heart thumping in her ears.
- The Minotaur shook its head as it growled.
- Amy frowned at him but he only grabbed Olivia's hand and pulling her toward the
  other end of the room to find Rory lying amongst glass on the floor.
- The Doctor laughed before shooting to his feet to run down the hall.
- She sniffled and wiped her face, taking a deep breath to calm herself as she nodded,
  looking up at him.
- On the Staircase...
- Olivia stared at the pictures on the wall lining the staircase leading to the lobby,
  the Doctor standing next to her with an arm around her shoulders.
- Olivia nodded but said nothing when she noticed Rory coming up to them and the Doctor
  looked to him with a short smile.
- Olivia smiled before the Doctor took her hand and pulled her down the stairs but
  just as they disappeared from Rory's sight, before they reached the others, she
  gripped the lapel of his jacket and pulled him into a corner, making him stare down
  at her with wide eyes as he pinned her in it.
- He said nothing as he stepped toward a door, still holding Olivia's hand and she
  stared wide eyes at the door, trying to pull him back by the arm.
- He opened the door enough to peek inside and Olivia tried to look inside as well
  but he kept one hand on her shoulder, pressing her against the wall.
- Olivia said nothing as she frowned at him when he shut the door, glancing at the
  Do Not Disturb door-hang on the knob before grabbing Olivia's hand again to drag
  her down the hall.
- Rita appeared into view on the screen, holding the phone to her ear with one hand,
  its stand in the other and the couple read the expression on her face.
- Olivia looked into his eyes and saw all the guilt he was feeling before he looked
  to Amy and Rory.
- They all froze and the Doctor spun around to stare wide eyes at Olivia as she slowly
  turned in her chair to face him tears welling in her eyes.
- ! 'Chapter 28: Sacrifices'
- She sobbed as she fell to her knees, clutching her head as she cried out in pain,
  the Doctor kneeling next to her.
- He stepped toward the symbols going through the air as Rory stepped toward Olivia,
  Amy heading toward the Doctor.
- Olivia finally detached from him and looked at their feet as Gibbis came up to them
  to look out the window as well.
- The Doctor looked to Olivia who was slowly stepping toward the TARDIS, his hearts
  clenching so tightly that he could hardly breathe before he turned back to the computer.
- The Minotaur began growling, softly, drawing everyone's attention to it, and as
  Amy, Rory and the Doctor stepped toward it, Gibbis remained in his spot as Olivia
  sat in front of the TARDIS.
- He stood and turned to head toward the TARDIS but stopped short when the creature
  spoke again.
- Later...
- He tossed the keys to Amy and she caught them before she and Rory stared at them
  then looked to the door.
- Rory turned to the Doctor and Olivia stepping between them to place a hand each
  around their shoulders.
- Olivia scoffed when he stepped toward the house, still looking at the car and she
  glanced between Amy and the Doctor.
- They both laughed as the Doctor stood from the car, his hands tucked in his pockets.
- She chewed on her lower lip nervously but only nodded that she understood.
- He stared at her for a moment, making Olivia swallow as she thought he was going
  to take it all back and say he was leaving her.
- She gave a slight frown but said nothing as he pulled her close to lean in and press
  his lips to her ear.
- TARDIS Kitchen...
- When the song ended Katy Perry's ET came on next, making her smile at the memories
  that came to mind of a different kind of hotel than the one they'd just come from,
  dancing, Cybermen and shots.
- She couldn't help but laugh before turning to grab the plate of pancakes and handing
  them to him.
- He gave a pout then made his way to the dining room, Olivia piling the fish fingers
  on a plate before following him and they sat at the table as the music still continued.
- He bit into it and hummed in satisfaction before scooting his chair closer to Olivia
  to wrap an arm around her shoulders.
- ! 'Chapter 29: Birthday'
- He still smiled as he showed his Psychic Paper to the person behind the cart she
  took the dress from before wrapping his arm around her shoulders to whisper in her
  ear.
- She laughed as he pulled her forward to a cart filled with untied bowties hanging
  around it.
- The information from the Tessalecta appeared on the screen.
- The date, time and location of his death.
- The Doctor smiled, his gaze scanning her from her silky raven hair that she'd let
  loose over her shoulders, the green, sleeveless dress with a skirt that brushed
  her knees to the cream and copper colored, strappy heels that gave her another three
  inches to her height of five foot two.
- He sighed, his hands settling on her hips as they kept each other's gazes.
- Felton Home...
- Joyce sighed as she switched the TV off then picked up her cell phone sitting next
  to her to text Olivia.
- Happy Birthday, sweetie xoxo
- She threw her arms around Olivia and Aaron to hug them close, tears of joy coming
  to her eyes.
- Everyone froze and looked to the stairs leading to the bedrooms as a familiar face
  made his way down the steps.
- Olivia pinched his wrist, making him wince as she gave him a mild glare before looking
  to Jack and Aaron.
- She only nodded, her mouth full of cake, making he and Jack chuckle at her as they
  watched her.
- Jack gave a long whistle as Aaron stared at her in wide-eyed disbelief.
- Olivia sighed and nodded as she stood.
- She ran into the TARDIS and shut the door behind her, hurrying up the stairs toward
  the console where the Doctor was working.
- ! 'Chapter 30: Teleport'
- Olivia's eyes widened as she saw the diapers and toys littering the floor as Craig
  stepped closer to the Doctor when they stopped at a door.
- Craig and Olivia hurried into the room after him as they heard crying and Olivia
  stopped as she looked around the baby's room.
- Olivia grinned and reached into the crib, carefully lifting the baby and pulling
  him close in her arms so that he was sitting in the crook of her elbow, her other
  hand on his back for support, still crying.
- She stepped into the chaotic mess of the kitchen as Craig ran around it, trying
  to fix a bottle for the baby as she set him into his highchair at the table, the
  Doctor stepping toward the fridge.
- The Doctor laughed heartily at a children's book he'd been reading as Craig spoke
  and Olivia shook her head in shame.
- Craig sighed, lowering his face to his hands and Olivia frowned at the Doctor in
  confusion as he ground pepper over Craig's shoulder before setting the grinder down
  and rubbing the other man's shoulders.
- Olivia couldn't help but giggle at Craig's sarcasm, but soon hid her smile when
  the Doctor turned a comical glare at her.
- Olivia frowned at him when she noticed him look at the newspaper on the table then
  place it back on the table…then pick it up again for a better look.
- Olivia and Craig glanced to the paper as the Doctor started pacing around the table
  again, Olivia's eyes growing wide as she stared at him.
- The lights flickered, making Olivia look around the room and stand, Alfie finally
  releasing her finger as she marched toward the Doctor.
- Alfie started crying as the Doctor dragged Olivia toward the door, Craig hurrying
  after them.
- He sighed, setting his forehead against hers, unmoving as they closed their eyes.
- The Next Morning...
- He stood, giving one of the kids a high-five as Olivia ruffled another child's hair
  before he ran off.
- He turned to step away, and Craig moved to follow.
- Olivia looked up at the Doctor expectantly as he twisted his mouth in thought before
  speaking.
- Craig instantly turned to Alfie's stroller, grabbing the newspaper he'd gotten as
  the Doctor looked around and Olivia stepped around the stroller to play with Alfie.
- The Doctor grabbed the stroller and started wheeling Alfie toward the door, Olivia
  following as Craig still examined the paper.
- The doors opened and he wheeled the stroller in, Craig following.
- The lights flickered, making it dark for a split second then there was a soft glow,
  Olivia and the Doctor instantly noticing their surroundings had changed.
- Craig started to turn around but Olivia quickly stepped between him and the Doctor
  to grab his arms and turn her back to him.
- The Doctor resumed adjusting his Sonic.
- She puckered her lips dramatically, closing her eyes and he instantly started pulling
  back as he laughed.
- ! 'Chapter 31: Cybers'
- The three stared up at the night sky as the Doctor aimed his Sonic up at it, scanning
  it.
- Olivia wrapped her arms around the Doctor's chest as they all walked back into the
  mall, letting him go to hold his hand as they went by the jewelry counter.
- The Doctor patted Craig's shoulder with a smile and was about to head toward Val
  when Craig stopped him.
- He placed air kisses on both her cheeks before grabbing Olivia's hand to pull her
  away.
- They were soon in the toy store again where Val claimed she'd seen it and Olivia
  held a net on a tall stick, frowning at the Doctor as he ducked under the table
  to scan beneath it.
- Olivia looked to Alfie as he began to fuss and tried to shush him as the two continued
  to argue.
- Olivia couldn't help but giggle at his reaction.
- That Night...
- Olivia, Craig, the Doctor and little Alfie kept hidden as George, the security guard,
  walked by them in the shopping center and as soon as he was completely out of sight,
  they all stood and the Doctor scanned the room with his Sonic.
- Olivia grinned at Alfie and reached into his stroller to lift him, tickling him
  and making him squirm in her arms, happily.
- Alfie made a baby noise as they crept forward.
- She nodded before handing Alfie over the Doctor.
- Olivia held Alfie toward Craig who took him just as they all heard a beeping, making
  them turn to see the Cybermat on the floor rushing toward them and the Doctor trapped
  it in the net he brought with him.
- The Doctor grabbed the Cybermat from under the net and stood, holding it up for
  Craig and Olivia to see.
- They all froze when they heard a terrified scream from somewhere in the mall.
- The Doctor groaned as he awoke, and Olivia looked to him with a sigh of relief.
- The Doctor stumbled around, using his Sonic as a torch again and he leaned heavily
  against Olivia.
- ! 'Chapter 32: Cybermat'
- He tossed the phone Olivia as the Doctor still worked.
- Olivia couldn't help but grin at how awkward he looked when he stepped into the
  room and she followed to see him step toward the crib with a stuffed bunny in his
  hand, shushing Alfie.
- He pulled out his Sonic and aimed it at the lamp, making Olivia frown before she
  looked up at the ceiling to see a much more believable image of the stars and galaxies
  on the ceiling.
- Alfie made a baby noise that made Olivia giggle.
- Olivia rolled her eyes as the Doctor pressed a kiss to Alfie's head and the baby
  made another noise, making the Doctor glance at her cautiously.
- He pulled Olivia out the door and down the stairs, still holding Alfie as they headed
  for the back door.
- The Doctor opened the door, dropping his Sonic Screwdriver in the process before
  shutting the door behind them.
- Olivia pulled the house phone from her pocket to speed dial Craig's cell.
- Craig launched himself off the Cybermat and the Sonic blasted it, shutting it down
  for good.
- The Doctor clapped as the two caught their breath, Olivia stepping up to them.
- She yanked her hands away from him, still seething before storming out of the kitchen
  without a word, both men staring at her exit.
- In the TARDIS control room...
- He bit his lower lip to keep from bursting into laughter but when he said nothing
  and only stared at her, she looked up at him with a frown of wonder.
- His smile was contagious and pretty soon Olivia couldn't keep herself from smiling,
  then succumbed to giggling.
- Olivia pulled back to look up at him, making the Doctor frown at her in wonder.
- He pressed a quick kiss to her lips before releasing her to hurry toward the door.
- Olivia giggled as he rushed out the door.
- Craig's Living Room...
- ! 'Chapter 33: Cybermen'
- He led her toward the fitting rooms, pulling the Cybermat from his coat.
- He lifted his hand toward the edges of the mirror and felt around before a soft
  sound was made and the wall opened.
- Olivia swallowed but nodded and he gave a sigh of relief.
- She instantly began pacing within the room, hearing his Sonic hum drift farther
  and farther away until the sound was gone completely.
- The Cyberman shot the scanner from Craig's hand, making him shout in pain and Olivia
  went to use her Sonic on another that approached him, but another Cyberman grabbed
  her from behind and held her arms behind her back.
- The Cybermen locked Craig into the machine.
- One of the Cybermen stomped on the Cybermat, destroying it.
- Craig froze as the helmet closed around him, Olivia hyperventilating next to him
  as a helmet closed around her head as well.
- Alfie's crying suddenly filled the room as he panicked when she didn't respond.
- An alarm suddenly blared as the Doctor noticed one of Craig's hands move.
- The Doctor pulled the bonds holding Olivia's arms and legs in place before working
  on the helmet.
- He trailed off as he slammed a fist into the helmet holding Olivia's head and it
  popped open, letting her drag in a loud breath then cough it out again before she
  fell forward and into the Doctor's arms, unconscious.
- The Doctor knelt down next to the lift to support Olivia as he tried waking her.
- He placed his ear next to her mouth and felt her breath fan his ear before lifting
  his head with a sigh to look down at her.
- Olivia couldn't help but burst into laughter as Craig hurried back toward Val as
  she stood at the register, Craig wearing new clothes.
- Later in the TARDIS...
- She smiled, weakly and nodded, feeling tears come to her eyes as she realized he
  knew her so well, and she wondered what she would do without him.
- He left the room, making the Doctor frown before he turned to the fridge and opened
  it to peek inside.
- They looked to Craig as he reentered, holding a Stetson in his hand and Olivia's
  smile instantly fell as both men grinned.
- He turned to her but his grin fell when he noticed her wiping tears from her face
  as she strained a smile up at him.
- They both watched her retreat, shutting the door behind her before the Doctor turned
  back to Craig.
- The Doctor marched out the door, missing the knock on the front door of the house
  as he spotted Olivia and hurried to catch up with her.
- He took her hand as she nodded and he led her to the blue box on the sidewalk, stopping
  at the door to stroke it as three children played in the small walkway they were
  parked by.
- He glanced to the children and stepped toward them as they stared at the couple,
  Olivia quickly wiping away her tears to smile at them.
- The TARDIS lurched on take-off, making Olivia take a step to the side to keep her
  balance as the Doctor stopped on the console to look up at her and she stared back,
  knowing he was talking about her.
- She swallowed as they stared at each other a moment before he slid his arms around
  her and hugged her close.
- ! 'Chapter 34: Why?'
- Gideon lowered his hood to show pale skin and an eye patch Olivia had seen before…on
  Madame Kovarian.
- Later...
- The Seventh Transept...
- Olivia swallowed hard as Gantok led her and the Doctor through a tunnel covered
  in cobwebs, the only light coming from the torch Gantok held as she clung to the
  Doctor's arm.
- Olivia's grip on the Doctor's arm tightened as the three saw the skulls shift to
  stare at them as they passed.
- They made their way through the hall to a room with pedestals, boxes on top of them,
  bare skulls on shelves all around the room.
- The Doctor and Olivia eyed the skulls around them as they shifted in their places.
- Dorium laughed and the Doctor looked to Olivia as she shuddered next to him.
- He cut himself off and looked to Olivia as she still held the handset to her ear
  and she felt tears well in her eyes at the look in his.
- He stepped closer to take the phone from her and wrap his other arm around her neck
  to pull her close.
- The Docks of Calisto B...
- Lake Silencio, Utah April 22nd 5:02 pm...
- Olivia nearly spit out her sip before looking at him with huge eyes.
- Amy giggled before looking up, seeming distracted and he watched her but said nothing.
- He stopped in front of it, watching the astronaut lift its visor to reveal a familiar,
  younger face.
- ! 'Chapter 35: Time'
- The Silurian nodded, bowing out of the room with his things to call for the soothsayer
  to be brought to Caesar.
- Olivia's breath caught when he lifted his head, his eyes boring into her for a moment
  before turning them to Churchill to answer his question.
- He told a story of things Olivia never dreamed of, but somehow felt familiar, as
  if she'd been there, and when he got to the cave full of skulls and a talking head,
  Churchill interrupted.
- He stopped and turned to Churchill, still holding Olivia's hand in the huge room.
- Olivia sniffled, a tear trickling down her cheek, making the soothsayer…the Doctor,
  look down at her in wonder as she wiped it away.
- He looked to her and she frowned in absolute confusion.
- Olivia frowned in thought, biting her lower lip but before she could think too deeply,
  Churchill had more questions.
- Olivia's eyes fell to their hands as he lifted her left one and the ring she couldn't
  remember where she'd found suddenly had an origin.
- He explained what he meant when he told them what happened…what River had done to
  change his fixed death, then said nothing else.
- The Doctor looked to his arm, noticing he now had four marks on it and Olivia met
  his gaze when he looked up at her.
- Churchill aimed his revolver at her but the Doctor grabbed his hand to push it away.
- Amy lifted the gun in her hand and aimed it at him without a word.
- With that, the men holding her dragged her out of the Senate Room, another man talking
  to Churchill to calm him down, and two more grabbing the Doctor to carry him after
  her.
- On a Train Bound for Cairo...
- He shoved himself to his feet and Olivia tried to help him but he only stumbled
  to the other side of the car, making her sigh and sit where he'd been laying.
- Later...
- The Doctor hugged her closer and pressed a kiss to her temple before a door opening
  behind them caught their attention.
- Olivia hugged his arm as she leaned her head on his shoulder.

- Donna.
- And now there was another bossy little red haired girl glaring at him.
- Okay, so maybe he shouldn't have spit that out on her floor, he'd aim for the sink
  next time.
- But if he didn't get some food in him he was going to go crazy.
- Did she have any peanut butter?

:dialogue:
- ! '"Hello!"'
- ! '"Ok…" He made a face, along with a strange noise.'
- ! '"New teeth… that''s weird."'
- He looked back at the two women, then continuing, "So, where was I?"
- He looked down at the Console before adding, "Oh, that's right!"
- He looked back at them, ending, "Barcelona!"
- ! '"6pm," he decided.'
- ! '"Tuesday… October…Five thousand and six… on the way to Barcelona!"'
- ! '"Now then, what do I look like?"'
- ! '"No, no, no, no, don''t tell me!'
- Let's see…" he muttered, checking himself over.
- ! '"Two legs, two arms, two hands… slight weakness in the Dorsal Tubercle…" Remembering
  the most important thing, his hands flew to his head.'
- ! '"Hair!'
- I'm not bald!"
- ! '"Ow… big hair… side burns, I''ve got side burns!'
- …I've got really bad skin…" he looked down, tapping his stomach.
- ! '"Lil'' bit thinner, that''s weird.'
- Give me time, I'll get used to it," he frowned for a few seconds before turning
  to the women again.
- ! '"I have got… a mole," he muttered excitedly.'
- ! '"No, really, I can feel it," the Doctor muttered again, more so to Eliza this
  time.'
- ! '"right between my shoulder blades, there''s a mole.'
- Love the mole!"
- he looked back at the two and ended, "Go on, then.
- Tell me, what do you think?"
- ! '"You''re very… pretty."'
- ! '"Ohhhh, I''m not a pretty boy, am I?"'
- When they broke apart, Eliza heard Rose whisper, "Who are you?"
- ! '"I''m the Doctor," he replied, slightly concerned at her sudden question.'
- ! '"No…" Rose shook her head in denial.'
- ! '"No, where''s the Doctor?'
- What have you done to him?"
- ! '"Really, Rose, it''s him."'
- ! '"Yeah, you saw me; I changed, right in front of you."'
- ! '"I saw him sort of… explode… and you replaced him like a teleport or a transmat
  or something..."'
- ! '"You''re not fooling me," she hissed.'
- ! '"Rose-" Eliza started.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Neither of you.'
- Nanogenes, Gelth… Slitheen…" she eyed them both up and down before whimpering, "Oh,
  my God… are you Slitheen?"
- Eliza chuckled, the Doctor replied for both of them, "We are not Slitheen."
- ! '"Send him back," Rose ordered.'
- ! '"I''m warning you, send the Doctor back, right now!"'
- ! '"Rose, it''s me!"'
- ! '"Honestly, it''s me.'
- To save my life, I changed my body, every single cell, but it's still me."
- Rose shook her head in denial again, whispering, "You can't be…" Where had her Doctor
  gone?
- ! '"Then how could I remember this?"'
- ! '"Very first word I ever said to you, trapped in that cellar, surrounded by shop
  window dummies… oh, such a long time ago," he smiled, and grasped her hand.'
- ! '"I took your hand, and I said one word.'
- I said… 'Run!'," he whispered the last word, giving it more meaning.
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Hello!"'
- ! '"And we never stopped, did we?"'
- ! '"All three of us, all around the Universe, running, running, running, running!'
- Hoping for our lives!"
- ! '"Yeah?'
- Hop…" the Doctor slowed down his imitation when Rose continued to stare at him,
  her bemused look still evident.
- ! '"No…" the Doctor ended.'
- ! '"Can you change back?"'
- ! '"Do you want me to?"'
- ! '"Yeah," Rose nodded immediatly.'
- Looking disappointed, he muttered, "Oh."
- When he said nothing else, she asked, "Can you?"
- ! '"No," he replied, biting his lip.'
- ! '"Do you wonna leave?"'
- ! '"Do you want me to?"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"But, it''s your choice, if you want to go home."'
- ! '"Cancel Barcelona.'
- Consider it a Christmas present," he said, giving as much as a smile as he could.
- ! '"We''re going home?"'
- ! '"Up to you," the Doctor shrugged.'
- ! '"Back to your mum.'
- Turkey!"
- ! '"Although, having met your mother, a nut loaf would be more appropriate."'
- ! '"Was that a smile?"'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"You smiled," the Doctor sung.'
- ! '"No, I didn''t," Rose replied.'
- ! '"Oh, c''mon, Rose.'
- All I did was change- argh!"
- ! '"Uh-oh," the Doctor said as he watched the energy fade.'
- ! '"the change it going a bit wrong," he noted.'
- ! '"Look," Rose muttered as she began to panic.'
- ! '"Let''s go find Captain Jack; he''ll know what to do."'
- ! '"Nah, he''s busy!"'
- ! '"He''s got plenty to do, rebuilding the Earth!"'
- ! '"Hello… I haven''t used this one in years…" he flicked the switch, giving the
  TARDIS a violent jolt, causing the three of them to fall against the Console.'
- ! '"What''re you doing?!"'
- ! '"Just putting on a bit of speed!"'
- He began pressing several more buttons, practically ripping them off from the amount
  of force her was using, yelling all the while, "That's it!
- We wonna go faster, wonna brake the time limits!"
- ! '"Stop it!"'
- ! '"Oh, don''t be so dull; let''s have a bit of fun!"'
- ! '"Let''s rip through that Vortex!"'
- ! '"The Regeneration''s going wrong, I can''t stop myself… ahh, my head…" he grimaced
  in pain, then going back to his maniac side.'
- ! '"Faster!'
- Let's open those engines!"
- ! '"What''s that?"'
- ! '"Crash land!'
- Ha!"
- ! '"Do something!"'
- ! '"Too late!"'
- ! '"Out of control!'
- Oh, I love it!"
- ! '"Hold on tight, here we go!"'
- ! '"Christmas Eve!"'
- ! '"Was he always like this?"'
- ! '"What happened?"'
- ! '"Is he alright?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," Mickey replied.'
- ! '"He just keeled over.'
- Where's the Doctor?"
- ! '"That''s him," Rose replied.'
- ! '"Right in front of you."'
- ! '"What do you mean ''that''s the Doctor''?"'
- ! '"Doctor who?"'
- ! '"That''s him, Jackie," Eliza replied.'
- ! '"That''s ''the Doctor'', that''s our Doctor," Eliza looked around, hoping no-one
  saw their grand entrance.'
- ! '"Right, you lot, get him upstairs, quickly."'
- ! '"Why, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"I don''t know.'
- I just have a bad feeling," Eliza replied.
- ! '"I''ll meet you up there in about an hour, lock your door."'
- ! '"The writing is identical…" she whispered.'
- ! '"It doesn''t make sense!"'
- ! '"I DON''T KNOW WHAT TO DO!'
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!"
- ! '"Come to 28 Sultan Street in London ASAP"'
- ! '"He''s in the spare room, here."'
- ! '"Is that Harriet Jones?"'
- ! '"How is she on the telly?"'
- ! '"She''s the Prime Minister now," Jackie replied.'
- ! '"Hannibal," Eliza quoted, Rose laughing at the inside joke.'
- ! '"They''re calling it ''Britain''s Golden Age''," Jackie informed them.'
- ! '"They keep on saying my Rose has met her."'
- ! '"Done more than that," Rose smiled.'
- ! '"We stopped World War Three with her."'
- ! '"All that time ago when she was just a back-bencher," Eliza added.'
- ! '"By the way, I have to go," she said to the two.'
- ! '"I''ve got business to attend to."'
- ! '"Where are you going?"'
- ! '"You can''t leave me here with him."'
- ! '"Don''t worry," Eliza replied.'
- ! '"I''ll be back later.'
- A couple of hours max," Rose gave her a look, Eliza saying, "I'll be back as soon
  as I can, okay?
- I'll see you soon."
- ! '"Hey there, Wolf!"'
- ! '"Mistress!"'
- ! '"Alright, alright, calm down, Wolf," said a voice Eliza recognised.'
- ! '"Do you have an appointment?"'
- ! '"In fact I do," Eliza said, lifting the letter.'
- ! '"How''ve you been?"'
- ! '"Fine," he replied.'
- ! '"It''s not been that long since I left you guys.'
- Take your boots off, mum doesn't like dirt."
- ! '"I know," Eliza chuckled.'
- ! '"This is as fast as ASAP is to you?"'
- ! '"Sorry," Eliza shrugged, "lost my way three times."'
- ! '"I know you did," the woman replied, switching the telly off.'
- Like a name in a fairytale."
- ! '"Death cannot stop true love.'
- All it can do is delay it for a while."
- ! '"Death cannot stop true love.'
- ! '"Think of something happy," he muttered to himself.'
- ! '"Stupid universe," he mumbled under his breath.'
- ! '"Get a life!"'
- ! '"An interesting gambit," he mused aloud, eyeing his opponent with a frown.'
- ! '"Do you really think that''s a good idea?"'
- ! '"Why?'
- Do you think that your pieces cannot counter it?"
- No, I have faith in them," his opponent assured him.
- ! '"It just seems...'
- desperate."
- ! '"We''ll see who is desperate, soon enough."'
- ! '"Who the...?"'
- ! '"Step lively, chaps," he growled, and set about to shake his pursuer.'
- ! '"I''ve been trying to concentrate a lot of my repair efforts here," Aislynn said
  sadly, escorting Owen through the scorched medi-bay.'
- ! '"Unfortunately, it''s going more slowly than I would prefer.'
- However, I do have some goodies that you might like," she showed him the tools that
  were available.
- ! '"Tissue regenerator… Bone-resetter, and pain dampeners," she pointed out.'
- ! '"There''s a whole decontamination suite...'
- well, there was anyway."
- ! '"I think a clever doctor could make quite a lot out of what is still available."'
- ! '"I''m fairly clever, but I''d have to know how to use any of it, to be able to
  do much."'
- ! '"You got a manual for any of it?"'
- ! '"This is the database access."'
- ! '"There are help files for everything in here.'
- They are for all educational levels and include tutorials and demonstrations."
- ! '"Right.'
- Well, let's see how clever I really am," he muttered and dived into the complexities
  of Gallifreyan medical technology.
- ! '"So we''ve found the Master, I take it?"'
- ! '"We''ve got coordinates to the main complex!"'
- ! '"Because your wife is genius!"'
- ! '"I think so too," said the Doctor as he headed over to help and Rose grinned
  at them both.'
- ! '"You took your time!"'
- ! '"I always dress for the occasion," he intoned solemnly and Susan stuck her tongue
  out at him.'
- ! '"Not funny, Grandfather!"'
- ! '"He is a bit of a peacock, though," Rose teased and Susan nodded.'
- Then, when it seemed as though they couldn't stand it anymore, when everything was
  stretched to the breaking point, the pressure ended, releasing its hold, and the
  TARDIS rebounded, as if someone had let the stretched-out rubber band go, with the
  characteristic "snap" from which snap-mines took their name.
- ! '"What the hell was that?"'
- ! '"A snap mine!"'
- ! '"Well, that wasn''t fun, but we seem to be okay," Rose said as she checked the
  TARDIS.'
- ! '"That was just one," the Doctor contradicted.'
- ! '"If we hit a cluster of those, it''ll tear the ship apart!"'
- ! '"Excuse me?"'
- ! '"They''ll pull her in a dozen different directions at once!"'
- ! '"We''d never survive it."'
- ! '"Right!'
- So, let's not hit any more of them!"
- ! '"Good plan!"'
- ! '"You said a doctor survived the war?"'
- ! '"Yes," the answer came back immediately.'
- ! '"Do you think she would consult for Dr.'
- Harper?"
- ! '"I think that when she finds out that I didn''t bring her in immediately, she''s
  going to twist me into a pretzel and re-engineer me as a wombat," came the reply.'
- ! '"Perhaps we could arrange… I don''t know, a video conference of some sort.'
- Harper."
- ! '"I think that could work, assuming I can still use a keypad after I tell Susan,"
  he replied.'
- ! '"I can provide scans and other data which I believe she would want to see.'
- If you can arrange something… I would be grateful."
- ! '"My honour, my Lady, She''s off-world right now, but as soon as she returns,
  I''ll arrange a chat," he replied.'
- ! '"I''m reconfiguring the shields!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"A Cow scoop," he shouted back, trying to push the mines out of the way, so that
  they could keep clear of any clusters.'
- ! '"What about the other ones?"'
- ! '"That will only stop the snap mines."'
- ! '"I know, but I know what to do with the Artron Bursts," he replied.'
- ! '"Why are we slowing?"'
- ! '"I''m broadcasting the deactivation sequences hard-wired into the mines by the
  builders," he told her and waited.'
- ! '"Brilliant!"'
- ! '"Yeah, I really am," he chuckled.'
- ! '"Are you all right?"'
- ! '"Yes, I am fine," she responded, though she was wide-eyed and scared looking.'
- ! '"Strap in," he ordered and she scrambled into a chair and belted herself in place,
  as he did the same.'
- ! '"Oh bloody hell!"'
- ! '"Adie, what was that about bubbles?"'
- ! '"Could they be used somehow like a bomb, or to fire the damn weapon?"'
- ! '"It was one of the first configurations to be abandoned," Adie replied looking
  confused by the question.'
- ! '"It involves storing the clones in a series of probability bubbles and firing
  the weapon.'
- The only thing it would be good for would be a suicide run."
- ! '"Yeah, that''s about what I figured," Koschei groaned and Adie''s eyebrows rose.'
- ! '"You think he''s making a suicide run?'
- I thought he was all about survival?"
- ! '"Yeah, when Rassilon was running the show, sure, but now?'
- I'll bet there would be no way to regenerate from something like that blast, would
  there?"
- ! '"No, but he''d probably also take out that solar system…"she muttered and he
  frowned in thought.'
- ! '"Auxiliary scanners on-line," he murmured.'
- ! '"Maybe he''s seeing something that we aren''t?"'
- ! '"There, look at that: that''s got to be a group of Möbius Loops.'
- That's quite a piece of engineering to be able to pull that set together like that,"
  she marvelled.
- ! '"No one ever said I wasn''t a brilliant engineer, Adie," he mused aloud, his
  hands teasing more data from the scans.'
- ! '"Let''s see more detail."'
- ! '"That must be where he is planning to set off the Lens.'
- Why fire the Lens and why here, next to those Loops?"
- ! '"What''s inside of them?"'
- ! '"Why now?'
- I told him about Susan long before this, what's he thinking?"
- ! '"That''s weird," he muttered.'
- ! '"Bio-metals?"'
- ! '"These scans are very odd," Adie told him with a shake of her head.'
- ! '"Look at this!'
- Have you ever seen anything like these before?"
- ! '"Yes, actually," he moaned and leaned back in his chair, suddenly feeling his
  age in a way he almost never did.'
- ! '"I have seen it before…in the Rani''s lab."'
- ! '"Are you sure it''ll be there?"'
- ! '"See, it''s right there," he promised.'
- ! '"Adie hasn''t failed me yet."'
- ! '"Okay, if Adie says so," Kimberly agreed and Jake smiled at her.'
- ! '"He''s certainly making a mess, isn''t he?"'
- Calling the Vortex a "mess" was being charitable.
- ! '"Fine," she muttered.'
- ! '"If that''s how it is, well fine, but he''s going to have to say it to my face."'
- ! '"Right, none of this then," he growled and re-established contact.'
- ! '"Damn it all!"'
- ! '"Bloody hell!"'
- ! '"There!"'
- ! '"Omega!"'
- ! '"Didn''t need me at all," Jake chuckled.'
- ! '"Of course we need you!'
- You're here for… let's call it, 'morale duty,'" Diana teased him and he laughed.
- ! '"Perfectly happy to be so," he told them and came down to join them.'
- ! '"3-2-1...," Madison counted down and the bridge appeared.'
- ! '"Whooo!"'
- ! '"Under here!"'
- ! '"It''s safe."'
- ! '"You''re sure?"'
- ! '"I''ve been here for more than a century and this desk never gets blown up,"
  she assured him and they all settled down to wait.'
- ! '"Reset will be up in about a minute."'
- ! '"I am never gonna get used to that," Jake muttered.'
- ! '"Who are you, anyway?"'
- ! '"Why do you all look like me?"'
- ! '"I''m Diana-37" she replied and showed her palm.'
- ! '"74," she whispered and looked stunned.'
- ! '"This is London-11, Madison-17, Kimberly-21, Kayla-8, and Jake-77.'
- We're having a revolution," she announced.
- ! '"We can do that?"'
- ! '"Why didn''t anybody tell me that?"'
- ! '"I need to get off this ice," he groaned and pulled his sonic, scanning for the
  thickest parts of it and then edging in that direction.'
- ! '"I''m coming, love, and hold on," he whispered to the icy air and ran faster,
  his bare feet sinking into the snow, his toes already going numb.'
- ! '"I won''t die on you," she promised.'
- ! '"I won''t leave you alone."'
- ! '"Mistress Susan?'
- Master Koschei?"
- ! '"Bloody hell," she muttered.'
- ! '"Well, Allons-y, as he likes to say."'
- ! '"How much farther to the Bridge?"'
- ! '"Another two days ride and then it''ll be three more before it opens," Sophie-24
  replied absently.'
- ! '"What happens next?"'
- ! '"Right, well, I have nineteen days in my Loop," Sophie-24 explained.'
- ! '"I also have most of this continent, so it''s a bit harder to predict.'
- It's why I like being near it."
- ! '"I had two and a half days in mine and only seven square miles," Tella-19 admitted
  and Sophie-24 hid her wince.'
- ! '"Soon we''ll have a lot more space and a lot more time," Sophie-24 assured her
  sister and Tella-19 nodded, though she looked rather nervous about that prospect.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Bloody hell!"'
- ! '"Yeah, welcome to a Wes Craven movie set," she grumbled and he looked at her,
  not having a really clever comeback just then.'
- ! '"I''m Diana-37," announced one of the strangers and Masha-20 was wondering if
  her mind had cracked and if she was now delusional.'
- ! '"I''m...'
- 20," she finally said and the apparitions all grinned at her.
- ! '"We''re having a revolution," Diana-37 told her.'
- ! '"Wanna join?"'
- ! '"Please," she murmured.'
- ! '"There has to be more to it than this."'
- ! '"Do I get a name to?"'
- ! '"You can have any name you like!"'
- ! '"Sasha," she murmured as they walked away.'
- ! '"Hey gorgeous, need a ride?"'
- ! '"Going my way, soldier?"'
- ! '"Always," he told her and piloted them in a crazy zigzag back up to the construction
  site.'
- ! '"Come here, lover, let me get you warmed up," she told him and he laughed.'
- ! '"Alone at last, wife, just had to crash land in a wasteland to get some privacy,"
  he chuckled and held her against him, deeply glad that she was still alive and he
  had her back in his arms.'
- ! '"Whatever it takes," she chortled and kissed him.'
- ! '"We need clothes and then we need to find Grandfather, Rose, and Adie," she reminded
  him.'
- ! '"And the Master, I think he fell into here too," Koschei sighed and Susan nodded.'
- ! '"Grandfather, Rose, Adie, and then the Master," she agreed.'
- ! '"I just washed my hair, too!"'
- ! '"Looks like soup!"'
- ! '"Damn it all!'
- Keep Susan out of the blast radius, how hard was that?"
- Curious, she inserted the disk and pressed "play."
- ! '"Omega!"'
- ! '"Who''s next?"'
- ! '"You have defeated our Champion, Diana of the Amazons," the wizened old Shaman
  announced and the other tribe members, in their feathered armbands and kilts nodded
  at her.'
- ! '"Does she get a prize?"'
- ! '"Hopefully, they''ll leave us alone as we cross the area," he replied.'
- ! '"At least until reset and then we''ll have to do it all over again," London-11
  grumbled.'
- ! '"Reset here isn''t for another week," Kayla-8 reminded them.'
- ! '"Plenty of time to cross."'
- ! '"As the victor in combat," the Shaman was telling them.'
- ! '"You are now Leader of our tribe!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I just wanted to cross the bloody river!"'
- ! '"It''s only for a week," Kayla-8 pointed out, but Diana-37 glared at them all.'
- ! '"Let the feasting begin!"'
- ! '"Let the feasting being," Madison-17 said with a sudden grin and they all headed
  towards the centre of the village.'
- ! '"It''s good to be the Queen," Diana-37 announced and looped her arm through Jake''s.'
- ! '"Come on Consort, come feed me some fruit."'
- ! '"You''ve got her running again?"'
- ! '"Doctor and Rose first and then on to Adie," he murmured.'
- ! '"I think we ought to call her Bessie 3," Susan told him, patting the bulkhead
  and, despite the desperate straits they were in, he found himself laughing.'
- ! '"So, is this one of the Loops?"'
- ! '"And how exactly did we get here, because Malla doing the maths in my head is
  not actually helping!"'
- ! '"Oh, you don''t need maths for this, just a bloody ounce of intelligence!'
- He was crazy, sure, but he was never this stupid!"
- ! '"I mean, he, of all people should have bloody well known better!"'
- ! '"So, yeah!'
- Because that absolute moron buggered up the whole bloody thing!"
- ! '"And now I want to know where he is, because I am going to tear the hairs out
  that bloody goatee one at a time!"'
- ! '"Oi!'
- Me first!"
- ! '"Remind me not to order the Brontosaurus next time," Cassidy-9 shouted and Diana-37
  nodded her agreement.'
- ! '"Why is it always lizards!"'
- ! '"Who was the nutter with the giant lizard fetish?"'
- ! '"One of the Temporal Engineers was probably a Godzilla fan," Jake-77 said as
  he drew back the bowstring and sighted along the shaft of the arrow.'
- ! '"Me?'
- I liked Hawk-eye."
- ! '"Mind you Brontosaurus is pretty tasty," Cassidy-9 told them.'
- ! '"Tastes just like chicken!"'
- ! '"Have you actually ever seen a chicken?"'
- ! '"Well… no, not really."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Just checking," Diana chuckled.'
- ! '"Bloody hell!'
- Get down!"
- ! '"Come on!'
- Get in!"
- ! '"This is one jury-rigged monstrosity, Shay," the Doctor told him with an admiring
  glance.'
- ! '"Did it without my screwdriver, too," he preened briefly and they laughed together,
  as they worked to get the wallowing cow back into the air.'
- ! '"Drives like dead whale," the Doctor complained.'
- ! '"Smells like one too," Rose murmured from behind them.'
- ! '"Now I know how dice feel," the Doctor quipped and Koschei nodded.'
- ! '"Thank you," she murmured to it and Koschei took her hand in his.'
- ! '"I''ve got some temporary shelter set up!"'
- ! '"This way!"'
- The "shelter" was tiny, part of an old shuttle that had been all but cut in half.
- ! '"Doctor," Adie said over the wind, "We''ll need something more solid shelter-wise!"'
- ! '"I suspect that underground will be our best bet, Adie, the surface has been
  scoured clean," the Doctor agreed, staring out at the landscape thoughtfully.'
- ! '"Worst mistake of my life, dating the Rani, we were at the academy, both rather
  young.'
- She was utterly brilliant, it's always been a weakness of mine, smart people," he
  said it with a rueful air, but there was still a tension in him.
- ! '"She had this crazy notion about breeding a race that could survive anything.'
- Half the time she was more hindrance than help to us, but she did make some breakthroughs,"
  he admitted.
- ! '"If I could have found a way to kill her, I would have," Susan ground out, face
  and eyes bleak and angry.'
- ! '"The things they let her do!"'
- ! '"Susan!"'
- ! '"Don''t!"'
- ! '"You don''t know!'
- Trying to see how long they could survive without vital organs!"
- ! '"I was crazy, narcissistic, and homicidal, but even I was sickened by the things
  she was doing!"'
- ! '"All right, then," the Doctor murmured, his words as much an apology as an acknowledgement.'
- ! '"I missed that and I''m quite glad of that.'
- But, I do remember what she was like and how much she loved a survivor."
- ! '"So, let''s find some better shelter, shall we?"'
- ! '"She was ultimately successful.'
- He hated it; he complained that he felt like the Doctor."
- ! '"We couldn''t beat them," she said.'
- ! '"We had to lock them up.'
- Here, I think."
- ! '"If the Manifold are here, and if this Loop is leaking...'
- Omega knows how many people are going to die."
- ! '"We still need to find shelter than this before the blizzard hits," the Doctor
  pointed out.'
- ! '"Where''s the Master now, I wonder?"'
- ! '"Where did he crash down?"'
- ! '"Maybe he died?"'
- ! '"No, he''s alive," Susan sighed, looking down at the slender golden cord.'
- ! '"He probably knows more about this place than anyone else.'
- We could use his assistance."
- ! '"I''ll go scout out the area," the Doctor told them, twirling his sonic in his
  hand.'
- ! '"It''s thawed out now, so should work fine."'
- ! '"Sixteen," Jake muttered and looked over at the group of Mashas sitting around
  the campfire.'
- ! '"Eight months of jogging between Loops," she sighed.'
- ! '"Eight months and we''ve only got sixteen!"'
- ! '"I know, Angel, but we can only cross when a bridge is scheduled."'
- ! '"When is the Doctor coming?"'
- ! '"Well, according to the count Adie gave me, only two days have passed in the
  outer Universe," he pointed out and she nodded.'
- ! '"I know, he''s probably running around being brilliant and all, but how long
  is it going to take us to get the others?'
- How are we going to all stay together, find food, and to survive, all in one Loop?"
- ! '"We do what we can, Angel, that''s all," he told her and she snuggled against
  him, head on his chest.'
- ! '"I know what I want to do," she teased and he grinned into the darkness.'
- ! '"Let''s get further away this time, I don''t need to hear their suggestions,"
  he chuckled and Diana grinned and dragged him further into the forest.'
- ! '"Koschei, can you reach K-9 from here?"'
- ! '"I sent out the recall, but I think he was too far away to hear it," he confessed
  and she sighed.'
- ! '"Or, he was too busy to come," she suggested.'
- ! '"Busy with what?'
- We're freezing out here!"
- ! '"The babies," she murmured, a stab of worry going through her.'
- ! '"K-9 will take care of them and the systems back-ups I installed were engineered
  to survive worse than that crash.'
- Even if they went down, K-9 will get them going again," he assured her.
- ! '"They''ll be fine."'
- ! '"Lucky we''re all Time Lords," Rose murmured.'
- ! '"I''m glad that Martha wasn''t on board, or Donna."'
- ! '"True, Rose.'
- We're all going to get warm and then go sledding, eh?"
- ! '"Right, let''s bundle up then," Rose suggested and Susan nodded.'
- ! '"We look a mess," Rose laughed.'
- ! '"I''d rather be warm and tatty than fashionable and freezing," Susan chuckled.'
- ! '"Amen!"'
- ! '"I think we can bypass this, that should restore a bit of power," he told him,
  "Except that we have to get this out of the way before we can even begin to work.'
- ! '"'
- ! '"Can you help me with it?"'
- ! '"Yeah," Koschei murmured and studied it a moment.'
- ! '"Brilliant," the Doctor told him and they grinned at each other.'
- ! '"Listen," the Doctor told Koschei.'
- ! '"You restore power and I''ll go outside, try and get the ship buried as much
  as I can, it''ll cut down the heat signature."'
- ! '"Don''t bother, that blizzard is going to cover us in no time," Koschei replied
  and then ducked under the decking to get down to the engines.'
- ! '"Maybe, but I''d rather that the Manifold didn''t notice us at all," he called
  down, handing his sonic to Koschei.'
- ! '"On the other hand, why don''t you try to bury us some more?"'
- ! '"Hurry, Rose," he breathed nervously.'
- ! '"Don''t worry, Koschei is turning on the heat.'
- In here, hurry, hurry!"
- ! '"Perfect timing, if I do say so myself," the Doctor said with a small smile and
  then, with a subsonic rumble, the engines turned over before they quieted down to
  a soft hum.'
- ! '"You got the heat turned on!"'
- ! '"Apparently, I''m a genius," he told her with a small smile.'
- ! '"You''re wonderful," she murmured.'
- ! '"I''ve changed my mind about staying at this resort," the Doctor announced.'
- ! '"The service is terrible and there''s no pool!'
- I give this place zero stars."
- ! '"Right, next vacation, somewhere warm!"'
- ! '"I think I liked your Ice World better," she told Shevia-48, who shook her head.'
- ! '"Nyet, you had not seen the wolves," she insisted.'
- ! '"Big as trucks and with huge teeth, long as you are."'
- ! '"Okay, that doesn''t sound like fun," Marissa-32 agreed.'
- ! '"How long does this last?"'
- ! '"Oh, only another two minutes," she assured her sisters, while redoing her neon
  orange nail polish.'
- ! '"This way," she told them.'
- ! '"Walk where I walk."'
- ! '"The reset will be coming up in four minutes thirty," she added and they all
  looked at each other, shrugged and kept on.'
- ! '"Who''s that?"'
- ! '"That''s Martinez, he dies in forty seconds," Mica-41 told them and they kept
  walking, even when they heard his choked off scream, forty seconds later.'
- ! '"I''m going to check for supplies."'
- ! '"Hey, I found the medi-bay.'
- It's not level but it seems to be in pretty good shape."
- ! '"Wonderful, I''ll be right there!"'
- ! '"I even found you a bonus," she said, coming out of the nearby locker room.'
- ! '"There''s twenty of them back here.'
- Rated to eighty below."
- ! '"Susan," Adie was looking very serious now.'
- ! '"It may take us days to get back to the TARDIS.'
- Is there anything we can do to make this place more habitable?"
- ! '"I mean, I don''t know how good it is, but at least it has power."'
- ! '"Well, food, water, and places to sleep, that''s going to be most important,"
  Susan muttered and turned in a slow circle.'
- ! '"We can sleep on the mattresses from the hospital beds, but food and water is
  going to be most important."'
- ! '"Bugger, blast, damn, bloody hell!"'
- ! '"Susan, you felt it?"'
- ! '"Koschei..."'
- ! '"Can you get a direction?"'
- ! '"We''ll work this out, love, now go!"'
- ! '"Susan!"'
- ! '"We have to stay here."'
- ! '"She needs to be the one to talk to him first, you know that.'
- She's the only one he'll really trust."
- ! '"It''s too dangerous!"'
- ! '"Doctor, this is Susan.'
- She survived Rassilon, she survived the Tower, the Time War, and she bloody well
  survived me, she can handle herself," he spat out.
- ! '"Stop thinking of her as that frightened, screaming child!'
- Too many lives are at stake."
- ! '"Quite right," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"There''s some history there," he told her.'
- ! '"Why can''t I ever get this right?"'
- ! '"I''ll be back soon," she promised her lovely ship.'
- ! '"I''ll bring help, the Master can fix you, my dear, dear, girl.'
- Well, once I fix him," she sighed and resumed her trudge through the blizzard.
- ! '"Oh, for Star''s sake, Master!'
- Stop moving!"
- ! '"Now stay still, so I can get this thing out of you!"'
- ! '"Susan...?"'
- ! '"Get back," he said with cracked lips.'
- ! '"Don''t be ridiculous!'
- Your hand!"
- ! '"Just get back," he demanded, trying to think through the haze in his mind.'
- ! '"Let me help," she asked him, reaching out beseechingly.'
- ! '"No," he said.'
- ! '"I can work myself free.'
- You stay back."
- ! '"Oh, you ridiculous man!"'
- ! '"I''m trying to help you!"'
- ! '"You''re not real!"'
- ! '"I can''t afford to go mad now!'
- I have to deal with the Manifold."
- ! '"All right, love," she told him and backed away, her eyes never leaving his face.'
- ! '"Farther than that.'
- Go on," he told her, voice shaking with pain and longing.
- ! '"We''ll find a way, Koschei" she murmured.'
- ! '"Omega, please let us find a way."'
- ! '"Oh my darling man!"'
- ! '"Please, just let me help you!"'
- ! '"Stop it!'
- You'll kill yourself and trying to regenerate in a bloody blizzard would top your
  ten dumbest moments, even stupider than trying to open the bloody Eye of Harmony!"
- ! '"Now!'
- We are going to my TARDIS and you are going to stop being so bloody stubborn."
- ! '"Susan?"'
- ! '"Yes!'
- It's really me!"
- ! '"Now lean on me, love, let me take care of you," she told him, having to shout
  over the wind to be heard.'
- ! '"Why… are you here?"'
- ! '"Because you were hurt!'
- Did you think I wouldn't feel it?"
- ! '"Just a bit further, now!"'
- ! '"But our… bond was broken," he cried out and the anguish of that was enough to
  make his voice break and his body tremble.'
- ! '"Look down!"'
- ! '"Does that look broken to you?"'
- ! '"Susan… Susan… I…" He struggled for words, trying to understand how and when
  it had happened.'
- ! '"Shh, let me get you inside," she told him, hauling him up the hillside.'
- ! '"Hold on!"'
- ! '"Greetings Mistress Susan," a tinny voice announced.'
- ! '"Master Koschei."'
- ! '"Hello, K-9, you good dog!"'
- ! '"This is not Koschei, this is the Master, please amend him to your files," she
  told the dog, who nodded and cocked his head at him, eyes scanning.'
- ! '"Pattern for the Master amended to files, status?"'
- ! '"Full access, plus all the same protocols that pertain to Koschei" she answered,
  to his shock, and then she stood up.'
- ! '"Oh dear, this place is a mess," she sighed, looking around.'
- ! '"I''m…" He shook his head.'
- ! '"I''m so sorry, I was trying to keep you out of here… why didn''t you just go?"'
- ! '"How could I?"'
- ! '"Right, we have minimum power to the medi-bay, thank you, my dear!"'
- ! '"Susan… please listen to me," he begged, struggling to his knees.'
- ! '"In the Tower… I pushed too hard.'
- I broke your mind like a twig," his eyes were brimming and his throat was closing,
  but he had to get through this.
- ! '"By the time I smuggled you out, it was too late, I couldn''t…" He closed his
  eyes.'
- ! '"Susan, I killed you.'
- I could never, never trust myself with you ever again."
- ! '"Love, I know, Adie told me," she murmured and he looked up at her in shock.'
- ! '"But, you''re wrong.'
- If you broke me, it was because I made the choice to die," she told him and reached
  down to help him to his feet, tucking her tiny form under his arm, helping him towards
  the medi-bay.
- ! '"I always knew that it might come to that.'
- I knew it was a choice I might have to make, I'd seen those futures and planned
  for it," she explained and he winced.
- ! '"Oh, Susan," he gasped and she leaned her head against his shoulder.'
- ! '"Master, I couldn''t let Rassilon see the Final Vision and I couldn''t let him
  have access to the Arkytior''s power.'
- So," she grunted as they shoved through the doors.
- ! '"If you broke me, its because I let you, because I knew that you would make sure
  he never got me, never got the power."'
- ! '"I let you, because there was no one I trusted more than you to make it quick,
  painless, and permanent, my hearts," she finished, pulling her flesh regenerator
  from the wall cupboard and going to work on him.'
- ! '"For… for so long I have… hated myself for what happened to you…" he closed his
  eyes against the whirling of the room, his mind trying to readjust itself to accept
  this new perspective.'
- ! '"I''m sorry that the other version of me had to make that choice, I''m sorry
  I wasn''t able to explain it to you properly.'
- I never wanted that," she told him, tears in her eyes as she healed him up.
- ! '"And I am really sick and tired of you decorating my medi-bay with your blood!'
- You know how old it gets, to have to keep putting you back together again, after
  you do something impossibly noble and stupid?"
- ! '"Oh, I hate when I cry, my face gets all red."'
- ! '"Don''t cry," he tried to soothe her.'
- ! '"I''m all right now.'
- Just got unlucky with a beetle, that's all."
- ! '"You have a hole in your shoulder, a shattered scapula, and a missing hand!"'
- ! '"Don''t lie to your doctor, I have the scans to prove you wrong."'
- ! '"Oh, you ridiculous man, the things you get yourself into!"'
- ! '"Susan…" he looked away, and then looked back at her.'
- ! '"Just tell me, are you… happy?'
- With him, I mean?"
- ! '"Oh course I''m happy with you, why wouldn''t I be?"'
- ! '"I meant with Koschei," he ground out and she looked at him in surprise.'
- ! '"You are Koschei," she reminded him and he frowned more deeply.'
- ! '"You''re not a nutter anymore, not that that ever mattered to me as much as it
  probably ought to have," she grumbled a bit and put the scanner aside, switching
  to a bone aligner.'
- ! '"Bloody hell, your scapula''s in pieces."'
- ! '"Listen… when I get back to my TARDIS, I can use it to open you a portal out
  of the Möbius Grouping.'
- You'll be able to get to a safe distance."
- ! '"You keep saying ''you''," she pointed out.'
- ! '"Like you wouldn''t be coming along."'
- ! '"Of course I wouldn''t be coming along, someone has to stay behind, set it off…
  can''t let the Manifold out of the Grouping, it''ll keep going, eating everything
  in its path, you''ll die," he explained, his vision blurring, as he fought his fatigue.'
- ! '"Well, I am sorry to hear that, because you are bloody well not staying behind,
  love, and that''s that, so make a new plan.'
- Adie says that there's another way to fire the thing, so we'll just have to come
  up with something else," she told him, giving him a fierce look, while he tried
  to keep his eyes open..
- ! '"You''ve seen her…?'
- Otherwise we need to revert to the point-blank configuration…"
- ! '"Adie is here and in a safe place.'
- If I can get you taken care of and get my TARDIS running, which is not going to
  be easy, we can pick them up, find your TARDIS and work this all out," she told
  him in a soothing voice.
- ! '"In the meantime, you put yourself in a healing trance for a bit, while I try
  to restore full power, all right?"'
- ! '"I''m dreaming," he murmured, almost whispering, as the truth hit him.'
- ! '"I understand now.'
- When I wake up, you will be gone…" He closed his eyes.
- ! '"No love, if you were dreaming, we''d be somewhere warm, like the house on New
  San Martine," she sighed and kissed him, her lips chill against his.'
- ! '"Right, need to lay the heat on, damned landlord, what a lazy sot he is," she
  murmured, moving away, and he plummeted into slumber.'
- ! '"Now, what did you want to show me?"'
- ! '"It''s a video, probably taken from surveillance satellites, of what happened
  here," Adie explained.'
- ! '"Not sure I want to know that," Rose complained.'
- ! '"Know thy enemy," Koschei pointed out.'
- ! '"We need to know more about these bugs."'
- ! '"Yeah, but I saw the bodies, it''s not gonna be pretty," Rose sighed and then
  waved Adie forward.'
- ! '"Let''s see it then."'
- ! '"Ugh," Rose made a sound like she was trying to keep from throwing up.'
- ! '"I...'
- I don't think even the Rani wanted that," the Doctor sighed out, his face filled
  with grief and his eyes wet.
- ! '"Who knows what she wanted," Koschei shrugged.'
- ! '"She was falling apart rather badly towards the end, trying to find a way to
  make sure that the Time Lords survived the War, or that some part of their legacy
  did.'
- She was obsessed with it, especially as the outcome worsened."
- ! '"I think it was a field test," Adie''s eyes were unreadable.'
- ! '"The Command Centre was run by some… very unethical people.'
- There were other projects going in addition to the Lens."
- ! '"Adie, there is ''unethical'' and then there is absolutely insane.'
- No one sane could have devised these things," the Doctor told her.
- ! '"For all of their arrogance towards ''lesser lifeforms'', Time Lords are a telepathic
  race, we feel death, you know that!'
- terrible."
- ! '"I didn''t really believe it until I saw them swarming like this," she managed
  to gulp.'
- ! '"And now, I…" She shook her head.'
- ! '"We are firing the Lens.'
- There are inhabited planets, I can't watch this in real life…" She shook her head
  again, then took the disk and carefully stowed it away.
- ! '"And I would like to archive this somewhere.'
- These people oughtn't to be forgotten."
- ! '"This is a Loop.'
- We don't know."
- ! '"I will find out though."'
- ! '"There were a very few loops with extremely long resets," Adie said.'
- ! '"Oh, how stupid of me, of course the Loops were being used for weapons testing.'
- Bound to be other weapons scattered around here, I don't know why I am surprised,"
  she said in a discouraged tone.
- ! '"It''s a ''safe'' way to test," Koschei shrugged.'
- ! '"After all, it''s not even in the main timeline, so you don''t risk it getting
  out and harming anyone.'
- The loss of memory for a chunk of a population is a problem, but people always come
  up with excuses for that sort of thing."
- ! '"Mass hallucination, drugs in the water, conspiracy theories," the Doctor grumbled.'
- ! '"People find patterns."'
- ! '"Until, of course, you engineer something that can break out of a loop," Adie''s
  voice was dry.'
- ! '"Yes, that is a bit of a problem, but in their defence, I don''t think anyone
  but the Rani would be mad enough to do so," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"Barmy cow," Rose added with a grimace.'
- ! '"Glad she''s dead."'
- ! '"It''s a pity, because she really was brilliant, but yes...'
- too far gone," the Doctor agreed.
- ! '"I hope that no one else would be mad enough to try something like this," Rose
  grumbled.'
- ! '"Well, Rassilon, but that would be because he would be absolutely sure that he
  could control it, even when it was patently obvious that he couldn''t," Koschei
  muttered.'
- ! '"He thought he could harness the Arkytior, after all," the Doctor agreed with
  a look of baffled incomprehension and disbelief.'
- ! '"He thought that defeating the Daleks would be ''easy'' as well, that we''d ''dispatch
  them in the first battle!''" Koschei looked furiously angry.'
- ! '"Stupid, narcissistic madman."'
- ! '"Coming from me, there is some irony in that."'
- ! '"I wonder what other madmen Rassilon collected," Adie mused softly, looking deeply
  disturbed.'
- ! '"Well, to be honest, insanity wasn''t really common on Gallifrey before the War.'
- The only people who were crazy for a very long time were Koschei, the Rani, and,
  according to some folks, me," the Doctor teased.
- ! '"After the War got really bad, then people started losing it.'
- Even in your temporal grace point, you must have felt the lessening of the Song,
  Adie."
- ! '"Yes," she said simply.'
- ! '"That lessening was terrible for all of us, but then the timelines collapsed
  and people came back to life, but with the memory of dying, again and again and
  again.'
- That's when it got much worse for us."
- ! '"Some soldiers died hundreds of times, only to not have died, or people who''d
  survived before, suddenly vanished as that line collapsed.'
- The uncertainty of not even knowing if you were really alive, or if you were dead,
  or if you'd never have been born in the next collapse, it was too much for people,"
  Koschei explained.
- ! '"We were insulated from all of that in the Grace Point, or most of it," Adie
  explained.'
- ! '"In the beginning of the Command Centre, people would disappear… well, they would
  be summoned to the War and things… sometimes we never learned why they were missing."'
- ! '"We were changing history so often that towards the end, probability began to
  collapse.'
- We couldn't feel the rest of Time anymore, we were locked away and trapped in there
  with the Daleks."
- ! '"But, none of this is relevant now.'
- We just need to save the greater universe from the Rani's monstrous inventions."
- ! '"It''s not relevant, but it should help to explain, Adie, why things were running
  off the rails so badly towards the end," Koschei put in and then frowned.'
- ! '"I was thinking about it you know, why did Rassilon never come to finish the
  project?'
- One too many timelines collapsed and his memory of the project was gone, he never
  remembered building it at all, because he never did, not in that timeline."
- ! '"But, there were hundreds of people who worked on it.'
- One of them must have remembered!"
- ! '"Yeah, but were they crazy enough to remind Rassilon about it?'
- If I'd found out he'd forgotten about it, I'd have been very careful to never mention
  it to him again," the Doctor assured her.
- ! '"I''d have kept my mouth shut as well," Koschei agreed.'
- ! '"Zoi-29, What''s next?"'
- ! '"Well, the helicopters will be coming over in ten minutes and then they will
  start burning off the swamp, so we need to make dry land before that," she told
  them and squinted up at the sun.'
- ! '"Right."'
- ! '"Everybody start running!"'
- ! '"You said ten minutes!"'
- ! '"They''re early?'
- They're never early!"
- ! '"Darling man, I am really going to need help," she grumbled, reaching out to
  her husband.'
- ! '"You''re up!'
- I've got croissants and coffee for you," she told him with a smile.
- ! '"Susan?"'
- ! '"Hello, love," she replied and slipped her arms around his waist, smiling up
  at him softly.'
- ! '"Feeling better?"'
- ! '"You...'
- you're really here… It's really you…" Suddenly, she was drowning in his embrace
  as he pulled her to him, holding her much too tightly, sobbing into her hair, as
  if he could never get enough of it, as if he could never get enough of holding her
  close to him.
- ! '"It''s me, love, it''s me, it''s okay," she murmured, a warm, soothing, meaningless
  series of words that only served to underline her presence and reality.'
- ! '"Right, back on the bed, I need to scan you to see how healed up you are," she
  told him gently, then stretched up onto her tiptoes to kiss his mouth lightly "Bloody
  hell, I forgot how tall you were last time!"'
- ! '"You''re here," he murmured and held her tightly to him.'
- ! '"Oh my love," she whispered.'
- ! '"What are you doing here?"'
- ! '"You were hurt, so of course I came," she answered like it was self-explanatory.'
- ! '"It wasn''t that bad," he disagreed with a shake of his head.'
- ! '"You shouldn''t have endangered yourself."'
- ! '"Wasn''t that bad?"'
- ! '"You could have died out there!"'
- ! '"Possible, but improbable."'
- ! '"Nevertheless, I am glad to see that you are safe."'
- ! '"Oh!'
- You never change!"
- ! '"How many times have I hauled your arse out of danger now?'
- Frankly, I've lost count!"
- ! '"I was going back in time so often I think I aged an extra century!"'
- ! '"Yes, I remember," he told her softly and then took one of her hands and kissed
  it.'
- ! '"I don''t believe I ever said ''thank you''.'
- I cannot tell you what it meant to me."
- ! '"Well, you''re welcome, but I''m invested in your survival now, so please stop
  with the killing yourself, all right?"'
- ! '"There is no other way.'
- I…" He thinned his lips.
- ! '"What are you talking about?"'
- ! '"There is an exponential curve involved," he explained.'
- ! '"We are far past the point where anything but the Lens will have a chance at
  deflecting it.'
- Well… possibly a TARDIS self-destruct sequence, although that is quite a bit dicier."
- ! '"Right, so we put Adie in the middle and we use the Lens, why does that mean
  that you have to die?"'
- ! '"She said she was the focus."'
- ! '"You said that," he recalled suddenly.'
- ! '"You''ve seen her and you know where she is," the words she''d said to him before
  came back and he nodded.'
- ! '"Right now, she''s with Grandfather, Rose, and Koschei, in a downed hospital
  ship," she explained.'
- ! '"The Doctor is alive?"'
- ! '"Yes, he''s alive," she told him.'
- ! '"There are about thirty adult surviving Time Lords, another thirty War Orphans,
  and I''ve cloned nearly two hundred more.'
- We're rebuilding Gallifrey, the one in this universe, anyway, Great Gran helped
  us escape the Time Lock," she told him, shuddering in memory.
- ! '"I see," he kept his tone neutral.'
- ! '"What''s wrong?'
- You just went gray!"
- ! '"Mm, I''ll have to watch my shielding," he said.'
- ! '"I didn''t realize you were rebuilding, ridiculous of me, of course you would."'
- ! '"That''s bad, why?"'
- ! '"Oh, love," he turned back and leaned down to kiss her forehead, "It''s not bad.'
- I just…" his voice trailed off, reaching for words.
- ! '"I was just operating under… incorrect data, I suppose."'
- ! '"Love, you''re coming back with us, you''re invited too, you know," she told
  him softly.'
- ! '"Now that I''ve found you, I''m not inclined to let you go."'
- ! '"Thirty live Time Lords, and the Doctor among them?'
- I'd be lynched," he told her, wanting it so much, but shaking his head in refusal.
- ! '"Why?'
- Koschei hasn't been," she pointed out.
- ! '"They aren''t all thrilled, no, but they all know what happened and they are
  willing to leave us be."'
- ! '"My presence would only make that more difficult," he argued, even though he
  wanted nothing more than to fall into her and lose himself, never to leave her side
  again.'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"I mean, sure, it makes my life a bit more interesting, but what would it change
  for them?"'
- ! '"I''ve tried to murder or enslave them all on multiple occasions.'
- It is less easily forgotten with two versions to remind them of it."
- ! '"Well, Andred will probably never trust you, but Dar always has, and the rest
  are mostly neutral.'
- My mother hates you, but she's crazy, and my Dad actually gets along well with you,
  which still shocks me," she informed him with a small frown.
- ! '"Well none of that can happen if we don''t deal with the Manifold," he finally
  muttered.'
- ! '"Does the Doctor intend to help in any way?"'
- ! '"Of course!'
- Saving the universe is sort of his hobby, you know," she teased.
- ! '"They are busy formulating a plan with Adie."'
- ! '"You were going to kill yourself to stop them?"'
- ! '"Yes, of course I was," he mused, looking down at her, his hands tracing idly
  over her without his conscious thought.'
- ! '"They have to be stopped, and who else was going to do it?"'
- ! '"I never wanted you to see all of this," he cried, feeling keenly all his failures.'
- ! '"To be in this wretched frozen hell and deal with these… horrible… monstrosities.'
- I begged Koschei to take you somewhere away, somewhere beautiful, to live with you."
- ! '"How could I have been happy, knowing that my happiness was bought at the expense
  of your life?"'
- ! '"Did you think you meant so little to me, that I could go lie on a beach while
  you burned?"'
- ! '"I didn''t think you knew of my existence," he replied, anguished that she''d
  been endangered by his stupidity, by his errors.'
- ! '"I thought that it was better that way.'
- That you would have him and be happy, and you never needed to know about any of
  this."
- ! '"I knew about you before he did," she told him.'
- ! '"I felt you wake up.'
- I would have felt your death just as strongly."
- ! '"I tried to get through to you, but you''d locked yourself up tight," she murmured,
  her voice a bit muffled against his shirt.'
- ! '"I… don''t know what to do now," he confessed to her.'
- ! '"Omega, I just… I never…" he shook his head.'
- ! '"You can start by kissing me properly," she informed him and tilted her head
  up to look at him.'
- ! '"If I did that," he said, and his voice was low and unsteady, "I could never
  send you back.'
- I could never let go of you again."
- ! '"Why would you have to?"'
- ! '"Did you think that I came here without having talked this through with Koschei?'
- No, it's the three of us in this and that's how it is."
- ! '"We''re bound up already.'
- It's done."
- ! '"I promised you forever, love, and that''s what you''re going to get.'
- Whether you like it or..."
- ! '"Susan...," he tried to find words for his fears, for his reluctance to get too
  near to her.'
- ! '"I''m yours and you''re mine and that''s all that''s ever mattered," she told
  him, repeating the words she''d spoken to him so long ago and he lost the ability
  to think rationally.'
- ! '"Oh my love," she murmured and he wasn''t sure what the future held, but he was
  deeply grateful that he had had this moment, this second chance with her.'
- ! '"Will it hold?"'
- ! '"It''ll hold," she promised.'
- ! '"Right, then lets do this," Diana-37 told the others.'
- ! '"You heard her, Amazons!"'
- ! '"Fall in!"'
- ! '"As nice as this place is, we need to get back to the TARDIS," the Doctor groused
  and the others agreed.'
- ! '"As far as getting back to the TARDIS...'
- you know there is another possibility," Adie told them.
- ! '"You might not like it much, though."'
- ! '"Adie, I haven''t liked any of this since day one," he bit out the words in a
  clipped, painful manner, his shields tightly up to keep his pain inside.'
- ! '"Nor has being dropped in a snowbank and then running through a blizzard been
  my idea of fun," Rose pointed out.'
- ! '"I made a big splash when I landed, Adie, but it wasn''t quite what I''d had
  in mind," the Doctor added with a shrug.'
- ! '"At this point, merely not liking something is going to be a big improvement!"'
- ! '"I know, I''m...'
- I'm so sorry."
- ! '"What do you think of these readings?'
- he might have kept notes."
- ! '"Adie, this is not your fault and that''s a bloody brilliant idea, you clever,
  clever, girl," the Doctor told her with a grin, but she was already thinking ahead
  and she was worried.'
- ! '"Is the Master right?'
- Will we need to use the Lens against the manifold?"
- ! '"I don''t know, it might be, but I hope not," Koschei told her and she looked
  at the Doctor, whose eyes met hers with the same concern in them.'
- ! '"We''ll need to do something brilliant though," Rose pointed out.'
- ! '"Those things aren''t going to just politely go away!"'
- ! '"Yes," Adie agreed, "But we can''t do anything about anything from here.'
- We need to get to a TARDIS where we can get hard data, then see what's what."
- ! '"Agreed," the Doctor replied with a decisive nod.'
- ! '"Operation Grand Theft TARDIS is a go!"'
- ! '"We''ll be fine," he told her and she chuckled.'
- ! '"You always know what I need to hear," she replied and he pulled her into a kiss,
  his mouth on hers, breathing warmth into the chilled parts of her soul.'
- ! '"I love you," he whispered.'
- ! '"You are stars, moons, suns, and planets to me, the breath in my body, and the
  beat of my hearts."'
- ! '"The sky that arches above me, the world below, all are barren without your touch,
  your fire lives inside of me, you are my centre, the pillar that makes me stand
  tall," she answered and he smiled at her, face alight with joy.'
- ! '"That''s beautiful, who wrote it?"'
- ! '"No one knows.'
- It was found after the Second Great Time War, stuck between the pages of a field
  manual, scribbled by some soldier on the battlefield," he explained.
- ! '"Everyone there had died, so there was no one left to solve the mystery," he
  sighed and she closed her eyes, thinking of some poor young man, trapped and knowing
  he was doomed, writing a last message to his true love, before going out to die.'
- ! '"That''s so sad," she murmured and he nodded.'
- ! '"But that poem has become the way our people have confessed love to each other
  for millennia now," Koschei told her.'
- ! '"That''s lovely, though," she agreed.'
- ! '"That his words could live on like that, making people happy for so long."'
- ! '"Well, we look like a matched set," Adie said and smiled at them.'
- ! '"Ready for Grand Theft TARDIS?"'
- ! '"Wouldn''t be the first time," the Doctor chortled.'
- ! '"Um...'
- it's my first time," Adie said somewhat sheepishly.
- ! '"Not to worry, we''re old hands at TARDIS theft!"'
- ! '"My first time too, actually," Rose admitted.'
- ! '"Not quite the klepto that those two are!"'
- ! '"Rose, has it ever occurred to you that your husband is leading us into a life
  of crime?"'
- ! '"Of course!'
- Why do you think I married him?"
- ! '"As long as we are agreed then… after you," said Adie with a smile.'
- ! '"Allons-y!"'
- ! '"Twenty," Jake-77 murmured to Diana-37, as they sat curled against each other
  and she nodded, looking at her sisters.'
- ! '"A year and a half," she replied with a certain amount of satisfaction, leaning
  back in Jake''s arms and resting her head on his chest.'
- ! '"Are you all right, Koschei?"'
- ! '"Yes?"'
- ! '"This is just going to take some adjustment.'
- Is that stupid?"
- ! '"Are you saying that Susan found him?'
- And now… they're together?"
- ! '"She found him, she talked him down, and now all three of us are...'
- together," he muttered, rubbing the back of his head and turning a bit pink.
- ! '"The talking him down part was ridiculously easy, I''ve never had an ounce of
  willpower where Susan was concerned."'
- ! '"I… can''t… do this," she managed to choke out.'
- ! '"I''m sorry."'
- ! '"Adie?"'
- ! '"Can I talk to you?"'
- ! '"Koschei," she was scrubbing her eyes.'
- ! '"I''m so sorry.'
- I know that, I'm so sorry…" She was fighting her tears, but they were still leaking
  out, even as fast as she was wiping them away.
- ! '"Why are you apologizing?'
- I'm the one who should apologize!"
- ! '"I muck up everything, all the time, I''m incapable of getting through a conversation
  without shoving my foot down my throat to the knee cap," he sighed.'
- ! '"I was thrown off-kilter and completely forgot about how it would feel to you.'
- I am really sorry."
- ! '"You''re actually a very comforting person to be around," she told him.'
- ! '"I guess I''ve just… been in some denial, I suppose.'
- And Gallifrey is gone, and Masha-37 went back to the Loops, and it's just been a
  lot in a very short period of time, but I feel like I should be handling it better."
- ! '"I shouldn''t be going to pieces.'
- I am so sorry, Koschei."
- ! '"Adie," he started and then paused.'
- ! '"I''m not as good as the Doctor at saying things, but I''ll try.'
- You've not been given time to mourn, or to even really think about it."
- ! '"You are doing what we''re all doing, the best you can with what you''ve got,"
  Koschei sighed.'
- ! '"How old are you?"'
- ! '"I was two hundred and eighty-one when I had the Vision.'
- two hundred eighty-eight when the Seers… when Rassilon..."
- ! '"When I was removed from the tower and consigned to the Master.'
- We worked on the project for a century and then I spent a century taking care of
  it, while he was in Stasis."
- ! '"So, you have had about two hundred years or so of actually being sane, but are
  about four hundred biological years, eh?'
- That's not all that much, Adie."
- ! '"Yes, that''s about right and whether it is much or not, I have been feeling
  very old lately," she told him, her face reflecting her weariness.'
- ! '"Yeah, I know about that feeling," he sighed.'
- ! '"So, the point here is, how are we going to handle this?"'
- ! '"Better than I have so far, I hope," she gave him a slightly watery smile.'
- ! '"I meant are you going to be able to be in the same room with him, without having
  the urge to grab a spanner?"'
- ! '"Sorry," she said automatically, but then said, "Yes.'
- I will… cope and he won't be threatening anyone at that point."
- ! '"No, just my sanity," he sighed and twitched, his face flushing a bit.'
- ! '"This is hard, harder than I thought...'
- confused, I guess."
- ! '"Talking about myself again, wow, I am still a wanker," he groaned, fighting
  to keep his mind focused.'
- ! '"No, it makes you honest," Adie disagreed, "And if you are a wanker, I am a double
  wanker, because I have monopolized the conversation so far."'
- ! '"But the whole point was that I came back her to talk about you..."'
- ! '"Let''s really just talk about you, right now," he pleaded, needing to think
  about anything other than how he was feeling just then.'
- ! '"Um… all right… let''s start with… I''m feeling better?"'
- ! '"That''s good," he told her, trying to think about it all from her point of view.'
- ! '"Look, if you don''t want to see him, we can always keep you two apart somehow."'
- ! '"That won''t be necessary for me.'
- I will cope," she said, mostly to herself, but in a tone that brooked no possible
  contradiction.
- ! '"The problem is going to be the others."'
- ! '"The Mashas," Koschei groaned, feeling a rush of apprehension as he tried to
  picture that reunion.'
- ! '"Do you think they will be as understanding as Martha was?"'
- ! '"No chance.'
- ! 'But I will say this: if one of them comes after him, it won''t be with a spanner,
  it will be with something far more potent."'
- ! '"Right if he can survive the first few weeks, he''ll be okay, if not, well, my
  wife will be utterly devastated.'
- Great."
- ! '"That will work in his favour," Adie pointed out and Koschei nodded, as his mind
  worked through that as well.'
- ! '"Yeah, it''s like a magical power she has, people don''t like to hurt her.'
- He wanted to adopt her, make her a Princess of Avalon, the Galahad accepted her
  favour, even, went into battle for her."
- ! '"The Queen of Atlantis gave her a crown of pearls, several Emperors of China
  dote on her, as for just everyday average people, they love her too.'
- I used to not understand it."
- ! '"It took me ages to figure it out."'
- ! '"Oh?'
- What is the secret?"
- ! '"It''s actually both absurdly simple and really complicated.'
- She cares when most people don't."
- ! '"She even cares enough about a bastard like me, to spend her life putting me
  back together again."'
- ! '"From here it looks like it was an awfully good investment," she told him softly
  and he shook his head.'
- ! '"I don''t know, Adie, I have caused her so damn much pain.'
- I'm just not at all sure that I'm worth it," he admitted.
- ! '"Did it ever occur to you that you have given her great joy as well?"'
- ! '"Not enough," he sighed.'
- ! '"But maybe two of us can try to make it up to her."'
- ! '"But that is the catch," Adie said and looked at him earnestly.'
- ! '"You can''t gauge how she counts the joys against the pain.'
- That's her view of reality."
- ! '"I''m a bitter, cynical fellow these days, but you''re probably right, I guess
  I know that in my head, but it never seems to sink into my hearts," he told her
  and the understanding explained everything.'
- ! '"You know," Adie mused thoughtfully, "I used to talk to him.'
- Do you really think she can make that much of a difference to him?"
- ! '"She did to me," he pointed out.'
- ! '"Am I anything like him?"'
- ! '"No," she admitted.'
- ! '"I was shocked, when I first came, at how different you were."'
- ! '"That''s because I''m really me now and because Susan has been, ever so gently,
  helping me put myself back together again.'
- So, I become that for her."
- ! '"You see?"'
- ! '"I think I do," she said.'
- ! '"I understand being rebuilt at eight, that''s for bloody sure.'
- But it… makes me feel better about watching to see what he does, I suppose."
- ! '"It actually helps a bit that you understand, Adie, though I''m also sorry that
  you do," he told her and shook his head.'
- ! '"It''s going to take time for him to let down all the walls he''s built around
  himself.'
- Well, I had Susan and even so, it was a near thing several times."
- ! '"You really think he will react that strongly?"'
- ! '"I know he will and not just because it''s how I reacted.'
- I can feel him up here," he tapped his head.
- ! '"It''s like watching flood waters pushing at a dam.'
- ! '"Oi!'
- We have a TARDIS to steal!"
- ! '"Move it!"'
- ! '"Come on," she called.'
- ! '"We have an adventure waiting!"'
- ! '"I''m all right now.'
- Please accept my apologies."
- ! '"Did you?'
- I thought you'd forgotten your toothbrush or something," the Doctor answered, looking
  puzzled, while Rose just sighed behind him.
- ! '"Your Majesty, are we keeping you waiting?"'
- ! '"So terribly sorry that we''ve delayed your trek through a howling blizzard!"'
- ! '"As you should be!"'
- ! '"Allons-y!"'
- ! '"For my own curiosity," Adie asked.'
- ! '"How do you steal a TARDIS if you are not keyed for entry?"'
- ! '"So, Adie my dear, I knew from a young age that I really wanted to get off of
  Gallifrey.'
- So, how does one fly a TARDIS without the bonded pilot, how do you transfer ownership,
  as it were?"
- ! '"You are obviously dying to tell us, Theta," Koschei drawled.'
- ! '"So tell us!"'
- ! '"The High Council has a reset code that works on all TARDIS, setting them to
  be ready to accept a new pilot!"'
- ! '"All I had to do was to steal that code and any TARDIS I wanted to pilot would
  be mine!"'
- ! '"You hacked the Protected Files," Koschei murmured in wondering awe.'
- ! '"How in all the hells did you ever manage that?"'
- ! '"That secret, I will keep," the Doctor answered, his eyes twinkling.'
- ! '"Along with all the others," Koschei murmured, but Adie wasn''t sure that she
  had been meant to hear that, so closed her mouth on all of her questions.'
- ! '"Wait, you could have stolen any TARDIS?"'
- ! '"Yeah," the Doctor replied preening visibly.'
- ! '"Then why," Koschei asked, exchanging a look with Rose.'
- ! '"Why did you steal the oldest and most unreliable TARDIS in the universe?"'
- ! '"Well...'
- So, I stole the only one that was unlocked," he admitted, looking a bit less proud
  of his achievement.
- ! '"Wait, you stole the code, but couldn''t steal a key?"'
- ! '"They are biolocked, you know!'
- You need one that matches your own TNA, or has been coded for guest entry to that
  particular TARDIS!"
- ! '"So, how did that Chinese boy get into your TARDIS, or Tegan, or all the other
  ones who just wandered in?"'
- ! '"Ah, yes, you see, my girl was very old and a bit...'
- capricious," the Doctor replied, his tone evasive.
- ! '"So, she just let in anyone she rather liked?"'
- ! '"Something like that, I suppose," he retorted and began walking faster.'
- ! '"So, all those times I broke into your TARDIS?"'
- ! '"She was what?'
- Cheating on you?"
- ! '"It''s very important, you see, Adie," she whispered to her.'
- ! '"To keep his ego from getting too out of bounds."'
- ! '"He has so much of it you see, it might get to be a problem," Koschei teased,
  but Adie could sense something behind it all, a concern, even a fear that both of
  them shared, as they turned and hurried off after the Doctor.'
- ! '"I know that there has to be a way to create a bridge from inside the Loops,"
  Leia-76 grumbled.'
- ! '"I understand the principles, of course, the physics is dead easy, but the maths
  are proving elusive," she sighed out.'
- ! '"Well, if it was easy, one of us would have figured it out before," Zoi-29 responded
  with a small smile.'
- ! '"True," Leia-76 agreed.'
- ! '"Still, it''s theoretically possible, I''ve got the proofs," she pointed at the
  scattered papers around her, all filled with equations in her cramped handwriting,
  and Zoi-29 grinned up at her.'
- ! '"I''m sure that it is, but I''m working with bone knives and bearskins here,"
  Zoi-29 reminded her and Leia-76 bit back a snort of amusement.'
- ! '"What I wouldn''t do for a proper computer," Leia-76 mused and Zoi-29 looked
  up dreamily at the sky.'
- ! '"A workshop, a proper one, with an ion lathe," she murmured.'
- ! '"Get off the hill!'
- Get off the hill!"
- ! '"Run!"'
- ! '"Rose!"'
- ! '"Get the door open!"'
- ! '"I''ll cover you!"'
- ! '"Adie, I need you to enter the code," he told her, his arms filled with Rose.'
- ! '"Okay," she replied, her voice a little shaky, but her fingers quite steady.'
- ! '"Adie!"'
- ! '"Where''s the medi-bay?"'
- ! '"This way!"'
- ! '"Can you handle things here?'
- Are you a medical doctor?"
- ! '"No, I am not a bloody medical doctor, I''m a temporal physicist and I have a
  PhD in Cheesemaking!"'
- ! '"Me neither," Adie said, "I''m going to help Koschei get the TARDIS going, you
  take care of Rose, all right?'
- We'll try to get to Susan!"
- ! '"Koschei!"'
- ! '"The Doctor has Rose in the medi-bay, engineering is a mess, how much power do
  we need for you to do a hop?'
- And where are the locusts?"
- ! '"Good, yes, more than we have, outside," he rattled back and dived under the
  console.'
- ! '"We need to get into the Vortex!"'
- ! '"You keep oscillating the shields, I''m going to engineering!"'
- ! '"We could do a burn?"'
- ! '"Pick some rooms, disintegrate them, convert the mass to enough energy for a
  hop, what do you think?"'
- ! '"No, no!'
- Give me five minutes!"
- ! '"Koschei… I seriously doubt that we have five minutes."'
- ! '"Quarantine field is going up," Koschei called to her and there was now another
  hum underlying the rest of the sounds.'
- ! '"Just to make sure that the tiny ones aren''t able to get in."'
- ! '"Are you all right?"'
- ! '"Aside from nearly becoming bug chow, having my best mate nearly killed, and
  almost getting fried by the TARDIS, cause I did something stupidly dangerous to
  restart the engines?"'
- ! '"No, I''m not."'
- ! '"If you want go to help, with the Doctor and Rose I mean, I can probably handle
  repairs," she said shyly.'
- ! '"No, the only thing that will help Rose is getting us to Susan as fast as we
  can," he sighed.'
- ! '"She''s a brilliant doctor and Rose looks like she needs a brilliant doctor."'
- ! '"Agreed.'
- How can I help?"
- ! '"Get down to Engineering and let''s see what we can do to get the architectural
  reconfiguration system up and running, meanwhile I''ll hit the wardrobe and grab
  something to wear that isn''t smoking," he sighed.'
- ! '"Koschei, we need Susan, or Rose might not make it," he called.'
- ! '"Already on it," Koschei told him.'
- ! '"I need to repair a couple of systems and then we''ll have navigation back online.'
- ! '"Adie, do you have the architectural reconfiguration system online, yet?"'
- ! '"Almost.'
- Once it's up, what would you like me to build?"
- ! '"They Zyton-7 crystals are fried, but I will have spares, the Hadron Power Lines
  are not going to last much longer and life support is going to need new components...'
- Well, start with the replacements for the Hadron Power Lines, I guess."
- ! '"It would be rather awkward if the Protyon Unit failed after all."'
- ! '"I''m nearly done," she told him.'
- ! '"And done!"'
- ! '"Right, get the Hadron Power Lines patched up and after that, the Life Support
  Systems, we''re going to need them," he sighed.'
- ! '"What will you be doing?"'
- ! '"Well, until I get the Directional Unit repaired, we can''t re-materialize, so
  I figured I would fix that," Koschei replied.'
- ! '"Yeah...'
- that sounds like a good idea," Adie squeaked and Koschei went back to work.
- ! '"Love!'
- There's trouble, time to move," she told the Master, as she zipped herself up.
- ! '"Who is Rose?"'
- ! '"Grandfather''s wife," she responded and then blinked at him.'
- ! '"You heard that?"'
- ! '"The Doctor is married?"'
- ! '"Master," the Doctor turned, nodded at him, then turned back, his face anguished,
  as he looked at the woman on the bed.'
- ! '"Doctor," he choked out.'
- ! '"I''ll just… get out of the way," he muttered, and edged towards the door.'
- ! '"Please don''t," the Doctor asked softly.'
- ! '"I could use the company."'
- ! '"If you like," he said at length.'
- ! '"You want something to drink?'
- It may be a wait."
- ! '"No, I couldn''t swallow," the Doctor sighed.'
- ! '"So, is this what you looked like during the War?'
- It's not bad, suits you."
- ! '"She''s going to be all right.'
- Susan will see to that."
- ! '"Yeah, she''s brilliant, really," the Doctor said, nodding jerkily, his eyes
  filling with tears.'
- ! '"I just can''t lose Rose, we''ve gone through so much..."'
- ! '"You won''t lose her.'
- I would never let that happen," the Master said gently.
- ! '"And Susan wouldn''t either.'
- Your wife will be fine."
- ! '"Best in the universe," Susan corrected softly as she worked.'
- ! '"She died, Adie said," he murmured and the Master nodded jerkily, unable to speak
  for the unbearable pain of the memories.'
- ! '"Yes," he finally croaked out.'
- ! '"She died."'
- ! '"I''m so sorry," his oldest friend replied and he nodded, the fight to keep himself
  from distracting Susan, as she laboured to save Rose, giving him no energy to answer.'
- ! '"Things will be better now."'
- ! '"Yes," he finally replied.'
- ! '"They will."'
- ! '"I''ve got her stabilized."'
- ! '"Thank the stars," he muttered and the Master shook his arm gently.'
- ! '"Go sit with her," he suggested and the Doctor nodded and staggered over to collapse
  in a chair beside his wife, holding her hand in his.'
- ! '"Nicely done," she told him with a smile and a kiss.'
- ! '"We used to be friends," he mused softly, "A long, long time ago."'
- ! '"We still are," the Doctor replied looking up at him with a weary smile and the
  Master nodded.'
- ! '"Yes," he agreed and fell silent again, still rather stunned by the vast changes
  in his life.'
- ! '"Adie!"'
- ! '"I found the Mashas!"'
- ! '"What the hell?"'
- ! '"Hold on, I''ve got to get your sisters out!"'
- ! '"I''ve got one out!"'
- ! '"They''re out of air, this one is unconscious!"'
- ! '"Faster!"'
- ! '"It won''t go any faster!"'
- ! '"What''s happening?"'
- ! '"They''re suffocating!"'
- ! '"Right!"'
- ! '"Or, we can do it her way," Adie murmured in open-mouthed awe.'
- ! '"Two more!"'
- ! '"Right, medi-bay, come on, follow me!"'
- ! '"The next one doesn''t open for three days," Jake explained patiently and Devorah-4
  nodded.'
- ! '"Fine.'
- We'll just have to find a fortified position," she replied in her low gravelly voice.
- ! '"What''s your suggestion?"'
- ! '"The ridge, it''s got water, shelter, and a good view of the surrounding area,"
  she pointed out and he nodded.'
- ! '"All right.'
- All we have to do it hold out for three days," he murmured and then sighed gustily.
- ! '"Amazons!'
- To the ridge!"
- ! '"Twenty-three," Diana murmured to him with a smile and he chuckled.'
- ! '"Almost two years," he replied a trifle grimly.'
- ! '"Move out!"'
- ! '"Susan said we lost power?"'
- He looked around at the lab and the damaged tubes, and frowned "What happened?"
- ! '"They were suffocating and we had to get them out, but there''s something wrong
  with this one," Koschei replied, blinking up at him.'
- ! '"It''s all right.'
- They don't suffer brain damage from hypoxia until the fourth minute," he said as
  he knelt down by the clone, and checked her pulse.
- ! '"No, she''s fine, there should be some other storage units around here somewhere,"
  he got up again and headed purposefully to a series of wall-mounted containers.'
- ! '"She''s not fine, she''s brain-dead or something," Koschei pointed out.'
- ! '"I reset her earlier," he said and then paused, realizing that there was something
  wrong with that.'
- ! '"You what?"'
- ! '"Let''s leave aside how incredibly unethical that is, but Susan will go spare
  when she finds out, so let''s fix this before she gets back," he suggested.'
- ! '"I''m not sure that''s a good idea," the Master said, moving to the wall where
  he had a number of storage units stacked.'
- ! '"What are you talking about?"'
- ! '"It won''t affect the Lens firing, only the Locus requires consciousness."'
- ! '"Susan mentioned that you know Adie''s location?"'
- ! '"She''s in Medi-bay, taking care of the Mashas," Koschei replied and it was weird
  for the Master to see himself from the outside.'
- ! '"Master, look at the girl in my arms and try to think about her from the standpoint
  of decency and compassion," Koschei told him through gritted teeth.'
- ! '"She''s a person, so please let''s reverse whatever you did to her."'
- ! '"I am the Master!"'
- ! '"I don''t have a decent, compassionate bone in my…" But he thought of Susan suddenly,
  and his scowl changed.'
- ! '"Try to remember that you are lying to yourself over here," Koschei chuckled.'
- ! '"Now, let''s fix her, please!'
- Before Susan finds out and goes all ginger on us!"
- ! '"Susan probably wouldn''t like it, that''s true," he mused.'
- ! '"Why don''t we upload a nice starting imprint for her, I am sure I have one around
  here somewhere…" He was struggling with himself.'
- ! '"No.'
- She is a person, you!"
- ! '"I know that!"'
- ! '"But, I don''t know how to make her behave!'
- We cannot have her sabotaging our every move!"
- ! '"And if you explain that to her, she''ll listen, and she''ll help!"'
- ! '"Try reasoning with her, instead of torturing her, and you might get some better
  results!"'
- ! '"Or we could leave her exactly as she is and upload her personality after we
  fire the Lens!'
- Adie is the only one who needs to be conscious!"
- ! '"Or we could keep your balls attached and fix her, before Susan finds out what
  you did, not to mention the other Mashas, who will happily lynch you when they see
  this!"'
- ! '"Omega!'
- Why does she put up with me?"
- ! '"Fine," he conceded, going over to the bins.'
- ! '"Not this one… not this one… I know it is in here somewhere… ha, this is it."'
- ! '"That''s the data transference interface, I''ll load up the crystals.'
- ! '"Bloody hell, didn''t you even put in surge protectors?"'
- ! '"I didn''t see there was a need, once we had ensured they couldn''t feel pain,"
  he mused, loading up the crystals into their slots.'
- ! '"It has to scare the hell out of them, having lighting rocketing around in their
  brains," Koschei grumbled and then started readjusting the interior, adding padding
  to it.'
- ! '"Don''t you remember?'
- I became an engineer to build things that would make people's lives better!"
- ! '"I was young and stupid," he mumbled, but he didn''t really believe it.'
- ! '"No, we were ourselves back then, not Rassilon''s lap dog!"'
- ! '"I wanted to make things that would make the universe brighter and better.'
- This is the leftover bits of that bastard in your head."
- ! '"I don''t know… who I am now.'
- After Susan died, I wasn't anybody anymore," he muttered, setting the crystal down
  and feeling a bit dizzy suddenly.
- ! '"I know.'
- nothing mattered anymore."
- ! '"I''m sorry.'
- It took me years to fight free of it all," Koschei sighed and walked over to him,
  putting a hand on his arm.
- ! '"Let''s put her back together and then we can deal with the Manifold.'
- After that, there will be time to think about what all this means, okay?"
- ! '"I''m reversing the charge, you ready?"'
- ! '"It''s going to be okay, little one," he told her soothingly and her blank incurious
  gaze on him was trusting and sweet.'
- ! '"Uploading.'
- It's going to take a few minutes."
- ! '"Tell me you didn''t just rip out the cooling systems."'
- ! '"Of course not, I shifted them so that they weren''t right up against the heat
  exchange port, it reduced their efficiency to have them there," he replied with
  a frown.'
- ! '"Huh, should have done that myself, I don''t know why I didn''t think of it…
  all right, initiating cooling."'
- ! '"Is this the ''Rat''?"'
- ! '"You didn''t know?"'
- ! '"Yes, it''s why I was reluctant to bring her back."'
- ! '"Actually, I was hoping to meet her," he murmured and the Master watched him
  start dumping the waste heat into the TARDIS systems, using it to help get the environmental
  controls up and running better.'
- ! '"You''re going to get your wish, if we can get the upload to take without burning
  her out," his hands were constantly playing over the controls, trying to keep her
  temperature low enough to prevent her from burning up completely.'
- ! '"If we can make it for the next two minutes, we''ll be fine."'
- ! '"Try this," he murmured.'
- ! '"Good idea."'
- ! '"Complete," he said and stepped back a bit, nervous that she might lunge at him.'
- ! '"Hey," Koschei leaned over her with a smile.'
- ! '"You okay?'
- I'm Koschei," he introduced himself.
- ! '"I take it things have run off the rails?"'
- ! '"It''s a total train wreck," Koschei agreed with a smile.'
- ! '"We''re in it up to our hips and things are ...'
- fluid."
- ! '"You need me," she said, and it wasn''t a question.'
- ! '"No, that''s not right, you need the Lens… you need the Lens."'
- ! '"Yes," he replied, looking down at the controls, "We need the Lens."'
- ! '"Well, eventually yes, but right now, I am more concerned about you.'
- Any memory loss, are you feeling seated?"
- ! '"By definition I will be unaware of memory loss," she pointed out to him, but
  her eyes twinkled in amusement.'
- ! '"Seating seems sound."'
- ! '"No, you''d have memory gaps, trust me on that one," he teased.'
- ! '"I''m glad though.'
- Have you seen Masha-37 or Jake, by the way?"
- ! '"No, no, wait please, I am behind the times.'
- I gather an alliance is in place?"
- ! '"We''re all working together, yes," Koschei replied.'
- ! '"He''s the alternate timeline version, I''m Susan''s husband," he explained.'
- ! '"The Rani left behind a really big problem, one that threatens a lot of lives,
  and we''re all trying to stop it."'
- ! '"Thus you need the Lens, and thus you need me?"'
- ! '"Well, we do need the Lens, but honestly, I just wanted to meet you," Koschei
  muttered, looking a bit flustered.'
- ! '"To be able to hack your own QTE, that was really impressive.'
- I liked that."
- ! '"It was damned dangerous!"'
- ! '"What the bloody hell did you think you were doing!'
- You also could have torn a hole in the timeline with your node creations!"
- ! '"Hey!"'
- ! '"She''d been tortured and imprisoned!'
- Whatever she did to escape, to survive, it was understandable!"
- ! '"I''m sorry, he''s still recovering.'
- What can I call you, since 'Rat' seems a bit rude," Koschei asked softly.
- ! '"We all chose names for ourselves.'
- My name is Tomoko-6," she told him.
- ! '"I was told there was a bondmate in the picture.'
- And because of that," she frowned at the Master, "You suddenly have decided to walk
  the straight and narrow?
- For her sake?"
- ! '"Didn''t Masha...'
- What is she calling herself now, by the way?"
- ! '"She took the name Diana, after someone called, ''Wonder Woman.''" She looked
  back at Koschei and her eyes twinkled at him.'
- ! '"And have you ever heard her try to explain something?"'
- ! '"Yes...'
- Just like having that thing upload a new personality," he said, pointing to the
  sarcophagus.
- ! '"Only it didn''t re-write me entirely, I was still in there, underneath it all,
  able to see what I was doing, but not able to stop myself.'
- Susan sorts things for me, points out which bits are really me and which are leftover
  junk."
- ! '"Now, she''s sorting for us both."'
- ! '"He''s not trying to ''walk the straight and narrow for her'', he''s trying to
  learn how to think straight again."'
- ! '"Noted," she said at last, and turned to the Master.'
- ! '"I want to know your current intentions towards us and towards the Lens."'
- ! '"We''re going to fire the Lens at the Manifold, that''s all.'
- After that, I have no intentions towards you at all," he replied and he sounded
  tired and a bit lost.
- ! '"I don''t know what I''ll do after that."'
- ! '"I want all the data on the Manifold," she requested and he spun and looked at
  her in surprise.'
- ! '"Why would you even need it?'
- We just have to destroy it," he replied, looking off-balance.
- ! '"Because I want to evaluate, for myself, that this is the right thing to do,"
  Tomoko explained and the Master nodded slowly.'
- ! '"You don''t trust me, no reason to, after all," he murmured.'
- ! '"If you want me to keep my end of the bargain, I require data input.'
- I need to be the one to make the call."
- ! '"What bargain?"'
- ! '"The one you are about to make with me."'
- ! '"I am?"'
- ! '"Yes," she told him, while Koschei watched their byplay in amusement.'
- ! '"What bargain?"'
- ! '"For my part, I will organize the Mashas, guarantee they won''t hurt you, and
  will make sure that, if we decide it''s the right call, we are in place for the
  needed Lens shot for this Manifold."'
- ! '"And what do you want from me?"'
- ! '"For the present, I expect you to provide me with all necessary data and logistical
  information," she said.'
- ! '"For the future… the day will come when the Mashas are going to demand some sort
  of...'
- justice."
- ! '"Justice?"'
- ! '"Yes, that would be nice, wouldn''t it?'
- I'd like some justice myself," he replied.
- ! '"I''d like to have my life back, I''d like my Susan not to have died, I''d like
  to have the bastards responsible for all of this in front of me, so I could beat
  them all to death."'
- ! '"One day I am going to send you a message with a time and coordinates," she said
  finally, thinking furiously.'
- ! '"You''re going to show up there, alone, and stay there until… matters are settled.'
- It'll prevent a lynch mob and it's the best I can do for now."
- ! '"This is the price required to save her...everyone''s lives?"'
- ! '"Yes," she answered and had a moment where she felt a spurt of pity for him.'
- ! '"So be it.'
- I agree."
- ! '"Good.'
- Data, please," she asked, feeling strangely sympathetic towards him and nearly laughing
  at her own impulse to shield and protect the crazed monster who'd tortured her for
  so long.
- ! '"Was Diana okay when you last saw her?"'
- ! '"I held back Diana-37 when we made our last raid.'
- Diana-37 was to be the backup agent, and if we were killed or captured, she was
  to continue the Revolution."
- ! '"Good, I was really worried about her," he said and smiled.'
- ! '"I''ll assume you left before Jake got there, then."'
- ! '"I never met anyone named Jake...wasn''t he Diana-37''s partner, when she held
  a job at Torchwood on Gallifrey?'
- How would he have gotten in?"
- ! '"Adie sent him into the Loops after her, when Diana didn''t pick up her packages,"
  he explained.'
- ! '"Adyra did that?"'
- ! '"I thought that was ...'
- Tomoko."
- ! '"No, Adie and I were the ones who opened the portal in.'
- I think that his feelings run much more deeply than just being her partner," Koschei
  murmured, flushing a bit.
- ! '"Really?'
- She was quite head over heels for him."
- ! '"Is he a decent man?'
- This Jake fellow?"
- ! '"He''s much better than that," Koschei assured her.'
- ! '"He''s honest, brave, and cool-headed.'
- He's one of my very few friends."
- ! '"Good.'
- I had hoped she would have the sense to select someone of quality."
- ! '"I think the selecting was fairly mutual," Koschei chuckled.'
- ! '"He doesn''t fall easily, but he falls pretty hard."'
- ! '"As fascinating as this all is, can we deal with the threat to all life everywhere
  and leave people''s love lives for later?"'
- ! '"Right, sorry," Koschei agreed and handed a tablet to Tomoko.'
- ! '"Here''s the data on the Manifold.'
- You can see that she didn't put any replication limits on them at all, barmy cow,"
  he grumbled.
- ! '"Wait.'
- She must have been as mad as a hatter!"
- ! '"I''d have to agree," Koschei nodded.'
- ! '"She also put no size limitations on them, and look at the intelligence readings
  at the larger sizes!"'
- ! '"They used mercury to make the felt for hats, by the way," mused Tomoko absent-mindedly,
  as she paged through the data.'
- ! '"The hatters.'
- That is why they all went mad; mercury poisoning… wow, that is quite a jump… but
  I could see it, each individual unit has a certain amount of processing power, put
  them together and eventually…" She shook her head.
- ! '"You break the sentience barrier.'
- We broke it with time; they have broken it with size."
- ! '"The First Emperor of China ate mercury, trying to gain immortality, it drove
  him crazy as well," Koschei agreed.'
- ! '"Well, you all started out as clones of the Doctor''s niece, so you were bound
  to end up brilliant, one way or another."'
- ! '"It was inevitable."'
- ! '"Wait… that girl is the Doctor''s niece?"'
- ! '"Yeah, Brax''s youngest, you didn''t guess?'
- All those years with her and you never noticed?"
- ! '"She''s just like the Doctor at that age...'
- except, much nicer."
- ! '"No wonder the entire thing has been buggered from the get-go!"'
- ! '"Well, if you''re going to use a member of that family, with all that they are,
  you are going to have to assume that probability is not going to remain within normal
  levels," Koschei shrugged.'
- ! '"She was foisted off on me!'
- Part of her punishment for double crossing the Seers and after her role in Susan's
  death…" but he bit back the rest of his sentence.
- ! '"Please!'
- Besides, she told us all that up front."
- ! '"But Rassilon obviously wanted her for more than just that reason."'
- ! '"By ''that girl'', are you referring to Number 2, Adie, the girl that Diana-37
  was telling me about?'
- ! '"Yes, that''s her.'
- Adyra," Koschei replied with a nod.
- ! '"I see.'
- Now, please tell me about Rassilon?"
- ! '"Over a billion years old, one of the three founders of modern Time Lord Society,
  a brilliant engineer, and crazy as a bag full of weasels," Koschei told her.'
- ! '"One of those people who plays chess three hundred moves ahead and has a back-up
  plan for his back-up plans, but who isn''t quite rational enough to realize that
  he can''t control everything.'
- He never seemed to understand that other people might be real and feel things."
- ! '"Think he could have been the person in the number one slot?'''
- ! '"If it meant being the one in charge, then I would have to assume that, yes.'
- Rassilon never saw himself as number 2," Koschei agreed.
- ! '"No, I think it is more than that… I mean, mathematically more.'
- But, I don't know how to do the maths; it's this special block transfer computation…
  I don't know, it's like it is at the tip of my fingertips, but I don't quite have
  the grasp to catch it."
- ! '"When Rose recovers, she can do the maths for us, she''s a Computationist," he
  informed Tomoko.'
- ! '"All right… you say the others are in Medi-bay?'
- I am going to head there, make sure they are all right," Tomoko pocketed Koschei's
  tablet and headed out of the room.
- ! '"So, still alive and reason wins the day," he murmured and gave his other self
  a light shake.'
- ! '"Now I just need to keep you alive, so my wife doesn''t cry."'
- ! '"You really think that was a win?"'
- ! '"Are you alive?'
- Then, yes, a win," he sighed.
- ! '"Or as much of one as we can get out of this mess right now."'
- ! '"When they gave me this project, I thought about just telling that pompous windbag
  ''no'' and taking the consequences, maybe joining Susan," he moved to one of the
  consoles that needed repair and grumbled as he removed a plate from it.'
- ! '"I''m sorry I ever started it at all."'
- ! '"He couldn''t have killed you anyway, we were essential to his plan to escape
  the Time Lock, the bloody drumbeat was his lock-on signal, so he could anchor through
  us and pull his arse to safety.'
- The wanker."
- ! '"It was?'
- That explains a lot," He was silent for a long time.
- ! '"Did Susan..."'
- He sounded almost shy, "...
- really feel it when I woke up?"
- ! '"Yes, even before I did," he admitted, feeling a bit shy himself.'
- ! '"Are… you all right with all of this?"'
- ! '"All right with it?"'
- ! '"Of course not."'
- ! '"The thing is, if I tried to be an arse and make her choose, all I''d do is tear
  her apart.'
- You're bound to her and so am I, so we just need to work this out."
- ! '"Work out what, exactly?'
- I was sort of envisioning that whatever she wanted would go."
- ! '"Pretty much, yeah."'
- ! '"But you and me, we need to be okay with this.'
- I don't think I could bear it if I caused her any more unhappiness."
- ! '"We''ve got to be friends, or she''ll feel it, you understand?"'
- ! '"Friends?"'
- ! '"If you''d asked me last week, I''d have told you that I was incapable of friendship."'
- ! '"Yes, I remember feeling that way," Koschei replied softly.'
- ! '"But, this week?"'
- ! '"I saw Theta crying over his wife and I ...'
- remembered."
- ! '"Yes, he has that effect."'
- ! '"Friends...,"'
- ! '"You remember Miranda," he replied, a statement, not a question.'
- ! '"When she died, as she was fading...'
- it all came back to me," the Master replied and the bleak expression, the way his
  energy went flat and grey, it was like a hammer blow on Koschei's psyche.
- ! '"No, I don''t deserve..."'
- ! '"You do, actually," he answered, but he was talking as much to himself as to
  the Master.'
- ! '"We were always being shoved away.'
- Everyone always gave up on us, even we did," he sighed out.
- ! '"She never did," the Master replied and looked up at him.'
- ! '"No, she didn''t.'
- Can you help me make her happy?"
- ! '"Omega, I sure as hell hope so," he muttered.'
- ! '"You''re me and I''m you, after all," Koschei chuckled after a moment.'
- ! '"It''s not like I''d be sharing her with another man, exactly."'
- ! '"I''m sharing her with myself.'
- We need to work together, okay?"
- ! '"Agreed."'
- ! '"What do you need me to do?'
- Specifically?"
- ! '"She''s not hard to make happy, really.'
- She doesn't like it when people argue and fight, or when she thinks she's making
  someone unhappy, so let's work out our problems calmly, and lastly, she's lost a
  lot of people and she's rather nervous about us, so, try not to die," he shrugged.
- ! '"The last one is actually the hardest."'
- ! '"Especially with the Manifold," he snarked.'
- ! '"Yes, we should probably get to that."'
- ! '"I love her, she''s everything to me, so, please, be gentle with her, okay?"'
- ! '"Always," he said simply.'
- ! '"Moira-3," Diana-37 called.'
- ! '"Aye?"'
- ! '"Any ideas?"'
- ! '"I say we just knock down everything in our way," Moira-3 said calmly.'
- ! '"Protect the boy, though, he''s a mite fragile."'
- ! '"I miss you, love," he sighed out, stroking his thumb across the back of her
  hand.'
- ! '"Its just no fun without you."'
- ! '"Well," she murmured softly.'
- ! '"Can''t have that, can we?"'
- ! '"Rose!"'
- ! '"How are you feeling?"'
- ! '"Like I got attacked by a giant metal insect, why?"'
- ! '"I''ve missed you," he sighed.'
- ! '"So you said.'
- Me, I've missed chips!"
- ! '"I shall fetch them for you instantly, my Lady," he assured her with a sweeping
  bow and she grinned.'
- ! '"Thank you, love," she replied and he shook his head, knowing what she was really
  thanking him for.'
- ! '"No, thank you love, for coming back to me."'
- ! '"Forever," she murmured and with a smile, he went to fetch her chips.'
- ! '"Hello dears, Rose is doing fine now," she announced.'
- ! '"Thank Omega," Koschei replied.'
- ! '"I''m really glad to hear that."'
- ! '"How are things here?"'
- ! '"We seem to have a truce with the Mashas," Koschei answered, as he crawled out
  from under the console.'
- ! '"Hello dear."'
- ! '"What sort of truce?"'
- ! '"Master?'
- Would you care to explain?"
- ! '"Um… no, not really," he sighed, but crawled out from under the console.'
- ! '"We''ve agreed to a… meeting to be affixed at a later date."'
- ! '"What kind of meeting?"'
- ! '"What about?"'
- ! '"''Justice,'' apparently, whatever that means."'
- ! '"What kind of justice can they possibly want?'
- Rassilon is the one at fault here and he's dead and gone," she insisted.
- ! '"We don''t know, but I don''t think that they will kill him, or anything like
  that," he assured her.'
- ! '"How could you possibly know that?"'
- ! '"Because they''re nice people," Koschei told the Master through gritted teeth.'
- ! '"It''ll be okay," he assured her.'
- ! '"Don''t worry," he soothed.'
- ! '"I am sure it will be fine."'
- ! '"Susan, Masha wouldn''t let them, you know that," Koschei reassured her, rubbing
  her back.'
- ! '"She''s a good friend and the other Mashas are also kind, decent people.'
- It's okay, they'll probably just want an explanation, or some sort of apology, all
  right?"
- ! '"I''m not sure I''d be able to stop Her, if they tried to hurt him," she whispered
  and Koschei snapped his mouth shut as the realization of that hit him.'
- ! '"Rose!"'
- ! '"You should still be resting!"'
- ! '"That''s what I told her," the Doctor agreed, but Rose rolled her eyes at them
  both and shook her head.'
- ! '"Universe needs saving, no time to sleep," she insisted and then turned to look
  at Koschei and the Master.'
- ! '"Feeling better?"'
- ! '"Yeah, I''m good.'
- How are you?"
- ! '"Rose, this is my alternate universe self.'
- Self, this is Rosemallatheragwynethtyler, a most brilliant Block Transfer Mathematician
  and my very dear friend," he murmured with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
- ! '"Oh!'
- You two really are just alike energetically," Rose exclaimed.
- ! '"Though goodness, you''re tall!'
- I hope that alternate universe version, or not, we'll be best mates too, eh?"
- ! '"I''m ...'
- pleased to meet you?"
- ! '"I''m the Master," he added, realizing that Koschei had neglected to mention
  his name.'
- ! '"We''ll need to do something about that, too," Rose sighed.'
- ! '"I am not calling you ''the Master'' like you''re some bloody panto actor, it''s
  just silly.'
- Bad enough I have to call my husband 'Doctor'," she complained.
- ! '"We''ll simply have to come up with something better than that."'
- ! '"Well, Koschei is already using that name," Susan pointed out.'
- ! '"I mean that is their real name, but, it''ll get a bit confusing for people if
  they''re both Koschei."'
- ! '"I''m Koschei as well and I am not giving up my name if the Doctor isn''t giving
  up his!"'
- ! '"Not fair!'
- You know why I can't give up mine!"
- ! '"Fine, I''ll call you Sherlock," Rose decided and Susan shook her head.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"No, certainly not ''Sherlock''," Susan insisted.'
- ! '"Fine, what about ''Benedict''," Rose suggested.'
- ! '"He looks like a Benedict."'
- ! '"Absolutely not.'
- I don't see why I need a new name at all!"
- ! '"Koschei worked fine."'
- ! '"What about something from your family?"'
- ! '"I can still call you both Koschei if you like, but for everyone else, do you
  have any ancestors you liked?"'
- ! '"Rose, please stop bullying him, I know you don''t mean it like that, but give
  him some space."'
- ! '"Sorry," Rose sighed.'
- ! '"I don''t mean to steam roll you, Koschei Two, but you really can''t go wandering
  around Gallifrey calling yourself "the Master", it''ll drive Adred up a wall, not
  to mention Romana, or Terrilian."'
- ! '"What about Guinntaschei, I liked him," his other self suggested, looking a bit
  uncertain as well.'
- ! '"The old man was one of the few decent people in our line.'
- Plus we can still both be 'Shay'."
- ! '"I definitely shouldn''t be named after anyone decent," the Master protested.'
- ! '"Guinn," Susan mused, obviously turning it over in her head.'
- ! '"That''s rather nice."'
- ! '"You can still be ''Shay, love.'
- You can be Koschei between us three if you'd prefer, as well."
- ! '"Guinn works for me," Rose agreed.'
- ! '"Fine, now that that''s settled, let''s get some tea and figure out what''s next."'
- ! '"Yes, I think that defeating the Manifold should be our top priority," the Doctor
  chimed in.'
- ! '"Shay, Guinn, let''s get the TARDIS sorted and get on with saving the universe."'
- ! '"But…" the Master sighed out.'
- ! '"I love you, no matter what you are called," she told him and followed Rose out
  of the room, leaving him with Shay and the Doctor, who were already discussing repairs.'
- ! '"But...!"'
- ! '"Aren''t you going to help?"'
- ! '"Leave him alone, you lot have done enough," was the last thing he heard as he
  left the console room, looking for some place he could think.'
- ! '"Ah...," he mumbled and she started in shock, dropping her spanner and jerking
  away from him, eyes wide in fear.'
- ! '"You dropped your spanner."'
- ! '"Yes," she replied and bent down to pick it up.'
- ! '"Do...'
- you need help?"
- ! '"Yes?"'
- ! '"You''ve got the Artron Energy Generator online?"'
- ! '"Then I''ll start in on the Hyper Time Ratio calculations," he said and she nodded
  again, watching him like he was a strange animal that she wasn''t sure about.'
- ! '"Hello!'
- I'm the Doctor!"
- ! '"My name is Tomoko-6 and I have heard of you.'
- ! 'I have a message for you from Diana-37: she wanted for you to know that she stands
  by her choice, she is all right, and doesn''t want you to worry."'
- ! '"I will still worry," he told her with a smile.'
- ! '"But, I never doubted that she had made the right choice.'
- We defeat the Manifold, then we find a way to unhook you lot from the Lens, so you
  can live your lives without fear."
- ! '"I don''t think we can be unhooked from the Lens," she said, and her face was
  solemn, her eyes searching his face, looking for something.'
- ! '"Of course you can.'
- What can be made, can be unmade," he told her and patted her shoulder.
- ! '"Koschei and I have been discussing it.'
- You lot could probably do it for yourselves, if you wanted to, but you'd all have
  to agree to it and no one could force you to, see?"
- ! '"Free will, my dear.'
- Best thing in the universe."
- ! '"Yes, that is a more accurate statement.'
- Once the lens has been fired for the first time, we will all know how to work together
  to summon it."
- ! '"Yes, but not against people, please," he murmured.'
- ! '"I don''t like killing and would really prefer if you would not harm anyone."'
- ! '''Not against anything," Tomoko said.'
- ! '"That''s the whole point of the Revolution, that we don''t have to be a weapon,
  that we can live our own lives, that we can be something else."'
- ! '"But the fact is that we will have access to an astounding amount of power.'
- When we come into the real world and are viewed by unethical people as a… a commodity."
- ! '"That''s always a problem.'
- There are always unethical people, but you won't be alone, you know and you have
  time to work something out for yourselves," he assured her.
- ! '"Now, I do need to get this TARDIS repaired.'
- You're Adie's Rat!"
- ! '"I''m so very glad I was able to meet you!'
- That was brilliant!"
- Thank you," she replied, her lips curving upwards.
- ! '"Did you use a quantum line order reset, or did you tunnel back through the execute
  files?'
- I've hacked them before, but never one in my own head!"
- ! '"Both, actually.'
- Now any command remotely sent to my QTE is queued up for my approval."
- ! '"Brilliant!"'
- ! '"That has to be my mother''s genes!'
- I bet you'll make a dozen breakthroughs!"
- ! '"Adie told us all about you!'
- You are utterly brilliant!"
- ! '"How did you all end up in the Loops, by the way?'
- I forgot to ask before," Tomoko frowned, looking up at him.
- ! '"Well, we saw that you lot had been kidnapped and came after him.'
- He tried to lose us by dropping time stops and stuff behind us and two of them collided."
- ! '"After that, we crashed rather spectacularly.'
- Now we need to rescue your sisters and defeat the Manifold somehow."
- ! '"Adie is the Time Lord that Diana told me about.'
- Where is she?"
- ! '"She''s the one, the one you were all cloned from and she''s my niece," the Doctor
  told her with a grin.'
- ! '"Which makes all of you my nieces!"'
- ! '"Seventy-five nieces!'
- I think she's down working on the TARDIS somewhere."
- ! '"Hey, you all right?'
- I'm sorry that they ran a bit roughshod over you, if you don't like Guinn, you don't
  have to keep it, you know," she told him.
- ! '"Come sit here with me," he invited.'
- ! '"It wasn''t the others you know," he told her.'
- ! '"I don''t care what they call me.'
- It makes me want to tie you down and do terrible things to you."
- ! '"I certainly promise to call you Master in the bedroom," she assured him.'
- ! '"Mmmmm… promise?"'
- ! '"Of course, Koschei likes that too," she giggled.'
- ! '"I don''t like giving up my name," he sighed out.'
- ! '"I didn''t like all the things I did, but there were parts of being the Master
  that I did like."'
- ! '"Koschei gave up being called ''the Master'' six years ago," she reminded him
  and turned her head so she could kiss him properly.'
- ! '"Voluntarily?"'
- ! '"He actually doesn''t like it when anyone else calls him that, just me.'
- Says it makes him uncomfortable."
- ! '"He should keep Koschei then," he said reluctantly.'
- ! '"I''ll be Guinn."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Because he makes you happy," he said.'
- ! '"You make me happy too," she whispered and kissed him.'
- ! '"Koschei, or Guinn, or Master, I don''t care, I just love you."'
- ! '"Very well, but I get to call the Doctor ''Theta''!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I''ve been thinking about the Manifold.'
- The Lens might not be enough, the way the mass is expanding," she muttered and he
  nodded.
- ! '"The thought had occurred to me as well," he admitted, though it was distinctly
  unpalatable.'
- ! '"Well, the problem is the lack of cap on the replication, right?"'
- ! '"Yes," he murmured, looking at her in a way that was making her feel rather warm.'
- ! '"Focus," she told him a bit breathlessly.'
- ! '"I am focused.'
- On you," he replied and pushed her back, until she was lying on the floor.
- ! '"Master," she sighed out.'
- ! '"Please focus on what I''m saying," she chuckled, as he began nuzzling her throat.'
- ! '"I was thinking that since they are bio-metals and actually have a DNA structure
  that I could create a Nanite borne retrovirus to rewrite their DNA.'
- If I could rewrite the portion that limits growth, as well as shorten the telomere
  lengths and age them to death," she murmured.
- ! '"Brilliant idea," he murmured, slowly kissing his way down her neck.'
- ! '"But, they''re really smart, they''d figure it out quickly," he pointed out.'
- ! '"I could make it so the effect doesn''t start too soon, so they''d spread it
  without realizing."'
- ! '"I think it''s a brilliant plan, we should certainly implement it."'
- ! '"Yes," she murmured, pulling him into another kiss.'
- ! '"Later."'
- ! '"Eat while you read," the Doctor suggested, putting a sandwich in her hand and
  Tomoko ate it without tasting a bite of it.'
- ! '"Why recursive fractals?'
- This 'Rani' person must know that there's a point where impracticality…" She trailed
  off.
- ! '"And no replication limits at all?"'
- ! '"She was probably suffering from Mental Distress brought on by Multiple Timeline
  Collapses," the Doctor told her.'
- ! '"Though, to be honest, she was insane long before the War."'
- ! '"And now the Lens is required."'
- ! '"Still working that one out, actually," the Doctor grumbled.'
- ! '"I would really rather not use it.'
- What I would like to do is find another solution, really," he replied.
- ! '"This is the main mass?'
- When was this scan done?"
- ! '"Almost two days ago," the Doctor admitted, feeling grim.'
- ! '"They''re chewing on the fabric of the Loop, trying to get out into the greater
  universe, all their attention is bent on it, which is why we''re not all Bug Chow,
  right now."'
- ! '"I''d say it is highly probable that they have already broken through."'
- ! '"The mathematics are against you."'
- ! '"Yes, well, I learned a long time ago that probability never takes into account
  sheer bloody minded stubbornness," the Doctor informed her.'
- ! '"Any ideas from Susan?"'
- ! '"She''s working on a Nanite delivered retrovirus to inhibit replication and age
  the bugs to death rapidly," Koschei told them, his blue eyes a bit unfocused as
  he spoke, his face flushed, and his hands clutching his spanner rather tightly.'
- ! '"Is it in mass production at this time?"'
- ! '"She''s doing her best, Tomoko, but we have two crashed TARDIS and have barely
  gotten the power up and running and hers can''t even de-materialize yet," the Doctor
  pointed out.'
- ! '"How can we help?"'
- ! '"With your sisters."'
- ! '"I am… trying to juggle a number of factors," sighed Tomoko.'
- ! '"The simple fact is that we cannot extricate ourselves from the Möbius Loops,
  and in spite of our best efforts, we have never been able to establish communication
  outside of them to call for help."'
- ! '"We have started a revolution, if you will, to win better lives for ourselves.'
- To choose our own destinies."
- ! '"Oh!'
- I love a good revolution!"
- ! '"Especially bloodless ones!'
- Besides, you don't have to ask, because we already volunteered!"
- ! '"I…" She looked intensely awkward.'
- ! '"Thank you," she finally said.'
- Now that I have… how do we get out?"
- ! '"We have two TARDIS, if we can get them going again, with one to hold open an
  end, we can both get out.'
- We go out the hole and simply tow the second one out of the Loop," he told her.
- ! '"Has Adie consented to be the focal point?"'
- ! '"Yes, she has, though she doesn''t like it anymore than I do," the Doctor complained.'
- ! '"There has to be another way!"'
- ! '"I await your suggestions," she said simply and he laughed, a bit bitterly, but
  also with real amusement in it.'
- ! '"I believe that Diana-37 may have a number of us gathered by now," Tomoko mused.'
- ! '"It may be possible to pick up a quite a few at once."'
- ! '"I hope Jake has managed to find her as well," the Doctor muttered, fiddling
  with his sonic as he thought.'
- ! '"Shall we check if he has done so?"'
- ! '"Go right ahead," the Doctor agreed.'
- ! '"Do we need special equipment?"'
- ! '"Actually, thanks to Koschei, we have a computer interface," she smiled.'
- ! '"I believe I can bridge to it.'
- We haven't been able to establish communication outside the Loops; but since we
  are all now inside, it should be possible."
- ! '"Let''s do it then," Rose said, bouncing a little.'
- ! '"I have been so worried about Jake!"'
- ! '"Sure enough," she smiled.'
- ! '"Because we are on the Master''s TARDIS," she said, "And are inside the Möbius
  Loops ourselves, we can get away with this.'
- We'd never be able to pull it off otherwise… ah."
- ! '"Plan A: Successful," she informed her alter-ego.'
- ! '"Plan A has been marked as successful," said Tomoko-Construct.'
- ! '"Do you require a data upload?"'
- ! '"No, not at this time.'
- Archive all and initiate teleconference."
- ! '"Archiving data.'
- Initiating teleconference."
- ! '"Teleconference guys!"'
- ! '"Seriously?"'
- ! '"Score, us!"'
- ! '"Ha ha ha ha, Tomoko-6 did it, she''s in control of his TARDIS!"'
- ! '"Vive la revolution!"'
- ! '"Hello!'
- Is Jake with you?"
- ! '"Hi Doctor!'
- It's the Doctor, get up here!"
- ! '"Hiya Doc, the plan a go?"'
- ! '"Operation: Rescue the Mashas is a go!"'
- ! '"Not that they really seem to need actual rescuing," he added with a grin.'
- ! '"They just need a bit of a boost, that''s all."'
- ! '"We have a plan?"'
- ! '"Of course," he assured her.'
- ! '"It''s the Doctor''s usual plan, run around flailing, until you figure stuff
  out, and then act like you knew all along," he explained.'
- ! '"Oi!"'
- ! '"It was a bit better than that!"'
- ! '"No, that was pretty much it," Rose agreed and smiled at Jake.'
- ! '"Where are you, we''ll meet you," Diana smiled at them and he looked at Tomoko.'
- ! '"Can we get there from here, once we fix the TARDIS?"'
- ! '"You broke it?"'
- ! '"In all fairness, the Master broke it and we''re just ...'
- well, stealing it."
- ! '"Can we get there?"'
- ! '"We''d have to re-bridge the loop, but that''s easily done.'
- Otherwise the time differential alone would make it impossible for us to carry on
  a proper conversation," the Doctor explained.
- ! '"It''s actually synced the speed of time in both Loops right now.'
- It'll be about another hour before the TARDIS is up to think you lot can stay out
  of trouble for that long?"
- ! '"No chance!"'
- ! '"At last, companions capable of honest self-assessment," the Doctor murmured
  and Rose smacked him lightly.'
- ! '"Oi!"'
- ! '"Right," Susan sighed and settled back on the floor, studying the notes.'
- ! '"Okay, how''s this?'
- After we release the Nanites, I have a second wave of them ready to pick up any
  stragglers?"
- ! '"As long as we use the Locus for the main focal point, those designs should work
  well," he agreed.'
- ! '"And the girls will be okay?"'
- ! '"They''ll be fine, with the Central Locus configuration, the Lens can be fired
  multiple times as needed, it was the real breakthrough."'
- ! '"We were mothballed right after that.'
- Literally overnight."
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"It wasn''t like that bastard to refrain from flaunting his power and ego, after
  all."'
- ! '"I don''t know.'
- Of course, I didn't care enough to pursue it too much."
- ! '"I''m so sorry, love," she told him and he was drowning in the warmth of her,
  as he pulled her against him and nuzzled her neck.'
- ! '"It''s better now," he assured her and it really was, the brilliant colour around
  him, after so long in black and white, it was incredible.'
- ! '"I''ll just have to learn to tolerate being happy."'
- ! '"I''m going to love you forever and you''ll just have to put up with it.'
- I'll try not to make it too onerous for you, my hearts," she chuckled.
- ! '"Assuming of course that the Rani''s little creation doesn''t munch us up first,"
  she grumbled.'
- ! '"Stupid, short-sighted, narrow-minded, egocentric, cold-hearted cow!"'
- ! '"Tell me how you really feel, now, don''t hold back," he teased and she laughed,
  but then he shook his head.'
- ! '"Don''t worry.'
- The Lens'll burn it to the ground."
- ! '"I have absolute faith in your brilliance, my gorgeous man," she told him, eyes
  shining.'
- ! '"That makes one of us," he said dryly and she burst into delighted giggles.'
- ! '"Oh, you ridiculous man!'
- It'll be brilliant!"
- ! '"Though I need to do my part and get the Nanites assembled and the retrovirus
  spliced."'
- ! '"And explain it to your husband, will you?"'
- ! '"Oh, I did that ages ago," she told him in surprise and he stilled, wondering
  how much she''d told him.'
- ! '"He thinks we ought to trail a juicy planetoid in front of the bugs, something
  with lots of minerals, so they will cluster to eat it."'
- ! '"Yes, that would pick up any stragglers, good idea."'
- ! '"Of course it is, he''s you, after all, so really quite fantastically brilliant,"
  she chuckled and he frowned at the wiring above him.'
- ! '"No, he''s the alternate one, the one who got it right, the good one, we''re
  nothing alike," he bit back, the bitterness of that nearly washing away the sweetness
  of her kisses.'
- ! '"Excuse me?"'
- ! '"You two are, minus a few memories, exactly the same, even your energy patterns
  are very nearly identical," she informed him.'
- ! '"Once I''m done here, you two can go back to your TARDIS and finish repairing
  it.'
- I can stay here and fire the Lens."
- ! '"I don''t like that idea at all.'
- I don't trust you not to do something incredibly brave, noble, and self-sacrificing
  if I'm not around to yell at you," she mused.
- ! '"Plus, you have obviously not been eating again, or taking care of yourself at
  all well," she clucked.'
- ! '"I''ve never done anything brave, noble, or self-sacrificing in my life," he
  mumbled, now a bit distracted, wrestling with the 2LO Energy Distributor Circuit.'
- ! '"I wasn''t going to start now."'
- ! '"Right, who was going to blow himself up to save the universe?"'
- ! '"Not the universe, just you."'
- ! '"It''s always been you," he told her and she nodded and dropped back down beside
  him.'
- ! '"I love you," she murmured and he slipped his hand behind her head and pulled
  her in for another kiss.'
- ! '"I love you, too," he murmured and they held each other tightly for a moment,
  before they both returned to work.'
- ! '"What''s all this then?"'
- ! '"The data on the Lens," Tomoko explained.'
- ! '"I can''t do Block Transfer Mathematics and Koschei says you can."'
- ! '"Yeah, I can," Rose agreed, grinning suddenly.'
- ! '"It''s a bit weird for me still, but I''m starting to really like it."'
- ! '"So, what I need is for you to do the maths and tell me what this Lens was really
  designed to do."'
- ! '"You mean besides blow stuff up?"'
- ! '"Yes, besides blow stuff up," Tomoko agreed and the Time Lady nodded.'
- ! '"The Lens has a secondary purpose.'
- I want to know what that purpose is."
- ! '"Right, I''ll get right on it," Rose agreed.'
- ! '"Thank you."'
- ! '"Be careful out there, the Manifold are extremely dangerous," he called after
  them and they nodded at him.'
- ! '"Where are they going?"'
- ! '"Outside," the Doctor replied, blinking at her innocently.'
- ! '"I know that!"'
- ! '"But why?"'
- ! '"Probably to have a private little chat," the Doctor answered.'
- ! '"All right, so why can''t they have it in here, where it''s warm?"'
- ! '"Because it''ll be about me, well, the other me, the Master, Guinn, whatever,"
  Koschei muttered and ducked back under the console.'
- ! '"Oh.'
- I see," Rose replied, her face gone still and serious.
- ! '"What do you think they will decide?"'
- ! '"Hard to say.'
- I mean, they've suffered a great deal," the Doctor sighed.
- ! '"So has he!"'
- ! '"I know, Rose," the Doctor soothed, then turned his head to where the laboratory
  was, looking like something from a Boris Karloff movie and Rose sighed out, following
  his gaze.'
- ! '"Right," she finally murmured and Koschei said nothing, just continued working
  on fixing the TARDIS.'
- ! '"What the hell do you mean?'
- He's back and we are just… letting him go?"
- ! '"What the hell did he do to you!'
- You're brainwashed!"
- ! '"I am not brainwashed," Tomoko-6 replied, staying calm in the face of their anger.'
- ! '"I am looking at the facts."'
- ! '"Which are what?"'
- ! '"What the hell justifies him just… walking away?"'
- ! '"He''s not going to ''just walk away''" Tomoko-6 shot back.'
- ! '"What he did was unforgivable and we will have to address that.'
- But we have bigger problems right now."
- ! '"His life is the price for the Time Lord''s help and we need that help.'
- This is what I have negotiated, and that is what we are going with."
- ! '"If not today, then when?"'
- ! '"Right now we need to deal with the Manifold.'
- We need to deal with that first before we can move onto dealing with the Master."
- ! '"How do you know we ever will?"'
- ! '"Because that was my price for our cooperation.'
- Agreed?"
- ! '"How do we know that we can trust them to hold up their end?"'
- ! '"Because once we''ve fired the Lens, we''ll know how to use it and it will be
  under our control."'
- ! '"What if Adie sides with them, though, she''s one of them," Evie-44 pointed out,
  looking unhappy about it all.'
- ! '"Then we focus through me and hope for the best," Tomoko replied, praying fervently
  that it would never come to that.'
- ! '"So, are we agreed?"'
- ! '"Agreed," Evie-44 said, and held up her hand.'
- ! '"Right," said Tomoko-6.'
- ! '"Now we have work to do… let''s get to it."'
- ! '"Hey," he greeted her with a smile.'
- ! '"What''s the plan?"'
- ! '"Trail a large asteroid with metal rich ore in front of the Manifold to gather
  them in one place, confuse them with a logic bomb, fire the Lens at them, using
  Adie as the focus, and then my wife will release the Nanites to clean up any that
  escaped the Lens," he replied.'
- ! '"It that doesn''t work, we''re buggered."'
- ! '"Us and everyone else," Tomoko mused, paging through the data on the scanners
  and screens, studying the problem.'
- ! '"She''s using a retrovirus?'
- Interesting."
- ! '"She''s a biomedical researcher and utterly brilliant, though she''s bugger all
  at the maths, and cannot fix a toaster without detailed instructions," he chuckled
  and then frowned slightly.'
- ! '"Would you be able to help me with something?"'
- ! '"Sure," she replied and turned those glowing eyes on him.'
- ! '"Good, this will take two people and the Doctor is off working on getting other
  systems up.'
- ! '"Bloody hell," she grumbled when she poked her nose over the console to look
  at the readout, then crawled back under again, and into the crawl space.'
- ! '"17.43," the Master''s voice read out to her.'
- ! '"Owwww!"'
- ! '"Uh...'
- Do you require medical attention?"
- ! '"Are you reading the first-aid card?"'
- ! '"Yes...?"'
- ! '"I wasn''t sure...'
- Are you okay?"
- ! '"You just scared me," Adie said, but resumed her previous position.'
- ! '"What was that reading again?"'
- ! '"17.43, but it''s dropping," he told her and she heard him fussing with something
  on the panel.'
- ! '"Okay, that''s better, it''s stabilizing."'
- ! '"All right, I''m giving this another turn," she said.'
- ! '"Right."'
- ! '"Say when."'
- ! '"A little more."'
- ! '"There!'
- Perfect."
- ! '"All right, moving on to the next bank," the next bank was further in.'
- ! '"You ready?"'
- ! '"Yes," came the reply and she thought that he sounded a little startled by the
  question.'
- ! '"You''ve changed a lot," she told him at length.'
- ! '"I was told you might, but I didn''t think it would be so fast."'
- ! '"I don''t think I have changed, I''m just not ...'
- who I was before."
- ! '"It''s a bit like waking up from a prolonged nightmare, really.'
- One of those dreams where you are doing all sorts of inexplicable things for no
  reason, except that in the dream, they make perfect sense."
- ! '"Never mind."'
- ! '"If you aren''t who you were before, isn''t that the very definition of change?"'
- ! '"If you want to look at it like that.'
- When you wake up from a bad dream, have you changed, or just woken up?"
- ! '"I suppose I must have changed, it''s just that I can''t remember what I was
  like before the nightmare."'
- ! '"That''s all for the best, I suppose… try it now."'
- ! '"Mmmm," he replied and she heard him fussing with the panel.'
- ! '"Yes, well within tolerances," he agreed and then fell silent.'
- ! '"Sorry."'
- ! '"Please...'
- ! '" she started to say and then snapped her mouth closed.'
- ! '"It''s… all right," she said clumsily.'
- ! '"M-moving to the next bank," and she winced again at the terrified sound in her
  voice.'
- ! '"I''m sorry, I''m… making a t-terrible muddle of this," she managed after some
  moments of extremely awkward silence.'
- ! '"No, you''re not, it''s me, really," he disagreed.'
- ! '"I''m ...'
- I'm sorry."
- ! '"We''ll need to rewire this whole thing, the entire board is shot," Guinn sighed
  and began pulling the panel off.'
- ! '"I don''t suppose you know where the spanner is?"'
- ! '"No, I think I have a lifetime spanner ban," she said ruefully.'
- ! '"I know where they used to be but they''re probably all locked up by now."'
- ! '"I seriously doubt that," Guinn chuckled.'
- ! '"Koschei said I wasn''t to worry, since your aim was terrible, though you did
  put in a great deal of energy."'
- ! '"I''ve felt so incompetent since being summoned here…" she grumbled, and got
  a couple of spanners.'
- ! '"You''re hardly incompetent, you''re just an engineer, not a soldier.'
- Nothing to be ashamed of there," he retorted.
- ! '"Being competent at killing people can hardly be a point of pride, after all!"'
- ! '"Do you know, it''s… nice… to be able to talk to you.'
- But I never pictured having a conversation like this while you were conscious."
- ! '"I''m sure I was a much better conversationalist while in stasis than I ever
  was awake.'
- I hope I was a good listener, at least," he chuckled softly and to her great shock,
  she found herself smiling at him.
- ! '"You were a good listener," she said.'
- ! '"But I''m… I''m glad you are awake, I think."'
- ! '"Well, give it time, you may come to wish I was asleep again.'
- I have been told that I am very annoying," he teased.
- ! '"But, all I ever wanted from you was to talk to you," she said and realized that
  that was true.'
- ! '"Well, you''re talking to me now.'
- What did you want to talk about?"
- ! '"Now that we''re here?'
- How mad is that?"
- ! '"Shall I tell you my life story, my humble origins in a back alley of Koalla
  Lampur...'
- no, wait, that was someone else's life," he joked.
- ! '"Sorry, I guess I''m a bit nervous."'
- ! '"Yes, me too," she agreed.'
- ! '"It''s weird though, I always had a sense of humour, but lately it''s been ...'
- Though, I suppose that's a matter of debate," he admitted.
- ! '"No, I would concur with that assessment," she said, absent-mindedly giving the
  spanner a tug.'
- ! '"Well, that''s good then," he said.'
- ! '"Though I do not think that I shall turn my hand to stand-up comedy.'
- Somehow, I don't think I have the right skill set."
- ! '"Are you kidding?'
- That's got to have enough material for a five minute stand up routine."
- ! '"Somehow, I think that making jokes about temporal mechanics and killing billions
  of people, might fall a bit flat," he pointed out and she winced.'
- ! '"That wasn''t exactly what I was thinking of, I…" She shook her head.'
- ! '"...was so isolated on the Command Centre that I..'
- sometimes forget what it was all for."
- ! '"It was for the self-aggrandizement of Rassilon, who could never feel as though
  enough people worshipped him," he muttered bitterly.'
- ! '"I know.'
- But...there was more to it than that, I think," she mused.
- ! '"No, not really.'
- It was all about him and no one else ever mattered, except in how they served his
  purposes," Guinn disagreed.
- ! '"Power-mad, egocentric, and narcissistic."'
- ! '"Yes," she agreed, "He was all of those things.'
- But it seems like…" She shook her head.
- ! '"Bah, forget him, he is gone and good riddance."'
- ! '"Yes, good riddance, but...'
- Some Earth poet said something about how we don't really vanish from life until
  all our works are forgotten, or something like that," he shrugged.
- ! '"As long as his works keep on, he''s not really gone, is he?"'
- ! '"Then we''ll never be rid of him."'
- ! '"Not until we''ve eradicated all his works," he sighed.'
- ! '"Mind you, I consider the Mashas more my works than his.'
- I suspect that it was sheer incompetence on my part, but lets go with her more generous
  interpretation."
- ! '"I suppose I am one of his works," she murmured, almost inaudibly.'
- ! '"I spent so much time with him."'
- ! '"Nonsense, you were around long before he came back and you spent more time with
  me than you ever did with him!'
- You'll live a few thousand years more and in a century or two, he'll be merely a
  bad dream," he assured her.
- ! '"You really think so?'
- That one day we'll wake up and be… past all this?"
- ! '"Yes, I do.'
- After all, we're Time Lords, Lady Adyra, we survive."
- ! '"Thank you," she said, and meant it.'
- ! '"Done," he told her and set in back in place.'
- ! '"Could you kindly re-calibrate this one now?"'
- ! '"Yes, of course, I am sorry," she hastened to get back to work.'
- ! '"Why are you apologizing?"'
- ! '"I only just now finished it."'
- ! '"I just… there''s so much going on, I always feel like I ought to be moving faster
  than I am."'
- ! '"I am quite familiar with that sensation," he admitted wearily.'
- ! '"So much to do and so very little time."'
- ! '"What will you do?"'
- ! '"I mean, if we get out of here and actually live."'
- ! '"Whatever I can to make Susan not regret her decision," he said with a shrug.'
- ! '"I don''t think she regrets it.'
- She is quite head over heels, you know."
- ! '"For Koschei, yes," he agreed.'
- ! '"For both of you, I think."'
- ! '"Perhaps she simply doesn''t yet differentiate us," he pointed out.'
- ! '"Give her time."'
- ! '"You know, you are actually pretty easy to differentiate," mused Adie.'
- ! '"I realize you are the same person at different points in the timestream, but
  those different experiences also make you different people.'
- I know I wouldn't mix you up with Koschei."
- ! '"You have more reason for caution, though," he reminded her.'
- ! '"No, it''s not the same.'
- It's not hard to tell that one of these things is not like the other."
- ! '"I suppose an inferior copy is pretty obvious."'
- ! '"No… you look different.'
- Kind of like… like fraternal twins, almost."
- ! '"Or two separate regenerations," he chuckled.'
- ! '"That''s all it is, really."'
- ! '"If you say so," she said doubtfully.'
- ! '"Try that."'
- ! '"Excellent," he pronounced.'
- ! '"This whole section is done now."'
- ! '"Shall we move on to the next one?"'
- ! '"We might actually get out of here…"'
- ! '"Yes, we just might," he agreed.'
- ! '"What are you working on?"'
- ! '"The Lens," she murmured and then turned and kissed him softly.'
- ! '"It''s a really brilliant construction, the maths are ...'
- elegant."
- ! '"No one ever said that Rassilon wasn''t brilliant," the Doctor sighed and wandered
  back to the console.'
- ! '"Corrupt, egotistical, insane, sure, bad at maths?'
- Neither of them could have succeeded without the other one."
- ! '"Malla says that there was a third person there, your ancestor, by some stories,"
  Rose commented, chewing idly on the end of her stylus.'
- ! '"Yes, there was, but little is known about him.'
- Rassilon wanted all the glory for himself, you see, so he betrayed Omega to what
  he thought was his death and then turned on the Other as well," the Doctor replied,
  skating carefully around the truth without actually lying to Rose.
- ! '"Thought was his death?"'
- ! '"Oh yes, Omega wasn''t dead, just turned to anti-matter and trapped in an anti-matter
  universe, where he ruled like a god and eventually went mad.'
- Twice," he explained and Rose gave him one of her looks of disbelief.
- ! '"No, really!"'
- ! '"He nearly took out Amsterdam the second time."'
- ! '"That''s actually all true," Koschei told her from under the console.'
- ! '"The real problem with Theta, is that he doesn''t really have to make up unbelievable
  stories, because very few people actually would believe the truth."'
- ! '"Yes, which is rather annoying," the Doctor grumbled.'
- ! '"I''m really good at making up unbelievable stories."'
- ! '"I think we need some sort of cosmic hyperlink or something, so that when he
  says something the Galli-pedia pages would pop up and give us the background, because
  otherwise, no one knows what you''re talking about," she suggested.'
- ! '"I''ll get right to work on that!"'
- ! '"You had to do that, didn''t you?"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"He''ll do it, you know.'
- He'll build it and we'll all have little glowing icons swooping about the place,"
  he explained.
- ! '"But...'
- I was serious, it would be really helpful," she replied and Rose grinned at her.
- ! '"I''m with Tomoko, that would be fantastic!'
- Even with Malla in my head, I get lost all the time," she agreed.
- ! '"Right!'
- My next project Docto-pedia!"
- ! '"Damn it all."'
- ! '"It''s in here, got to be, I know it is in here."'
- ! '"What are you looking for?"'
- ! '"The secondary purpose of the Lens."'
- ! '"Yeah," Rose agreed.'
- ! '"that''s baffling me too."'
- ! '"I''m glad I''m not alone in that," Tomoko groused.'
- ! '"Apparently everyone who knew what it was really all about is dead and gone."'
- ! '"Give that lever a pull," Koschei called out, his voice a bit muffled by the
  vent.'
- ! '"Well, give me some time with this, I''m sure I can break it down," Rose replied,
  then went back to work again, her tongue out slightly as she tapped the stylus on
  the pad.'
- ! '"Bloody hell!'
- Stop!"
- ! '"Sorry!'
- Must have forgotten to disable the power."
- ! '"Let me," the Doctor called and hit a switch on the console.'
- ! '"There you go!"'
- ! '"Thanks," Koschei called and his hand reached out for different sonic before
  vanishing again.'
- ! '"The thing is the Lens has never been fired, not even test fired.'
- I don't think we can afford to test it, as it may only work once, although it seems
  to be fine in the simulations that I have run," Tomoko muttered.
- ! '"I hardly think that something Rassilon and the Master built is going to not
  work.'
- They were evil, mad, and utterly destructive, certainly, but brilliant engineers,"
  the Doctor assured her.
- ! '"Thanks," Koschei snarked, his voice echoing hollowly from inside the vent.'
- ! '"No problem, old bean," the Doctor teased.'
- ! '"Ah!'
- so kind of you!"
- ! '"The thing is," Tomoko said, as she fetched herself a cup of steaming tea.'
- ! '"I know we are missing something and I don''t want to find out what it is when
  we fire this thing at the universe''s largest bug."'
- ! '"Well, I have some theories about that, but I don''t think they have much to
  do with the Manifold really," the Doctor told her with a frown.'
- ! '"Okay, tell me another unbelievable story," Rose suggested, looking up from her
  work with a tongue in teeth grin.'
- ! '"What do you know about Gallifreyan mythology, Tomoko?"'
- ! '"Nothing whatsoever."'
- ! '"Right.'
- So there three Founders of Gallifreyan society, as it was before it was destroyed,
  and then there was what came before."
- ! '"The before is rather tricky, no one is sure about all the details, things grow
  fuzzy over the vast vista of time, hard to make out.'
- Beings of energy, not the flesh, though they could make themselves physical, if
  needed."
- ! '"They were the template upon which Rassilon, Omega, and ...'
- That was all side-effects, you see!"
- ! '"We were like you, back then, Tomoko," he continued.'
- ! '"Three-dimensional, and we thought that it would be better if we went a bit farther.'
- It worked!"
- ! '"We expanded into five dimensions, became so much more than we were before."'
- ! '"It''s beautiful you know.'
- But, the price we paid, I still don't know," he muttered and Koschei was nodding
  slowly.
- ! '"So, you see," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"We made ourselves over, but millions died, only those of us with a certain genetic
  trigger lived through it."'
- ! '"One of the survivors was a young girl.'
- become one of us, for a moment or two."
- ! '"Like Susan," Koschei murmured, his eyes darkening with some private sorrow.'
- ! '"That was what Rassilon craved above all, not just immortality, but absolute
  power over reality itself, the power to mould the universe into any form of his
  choosing.'
- ! '"Bloody hell!"'
- ! '"I see it!"'
- ! '"That is why I was created, to stand in Adie''s place so that the Lens could
  be tested.'
- That way they could make sure all of the infrastructure was working, before they
  risked using the one component they couldn't afford to replace."
- ! '"That''s why they never bothered to try and set up a stable interface," she said
  in a low voice.'
- ! '"I was a throwaway clone.'
- I was always meant to be discarded."
- ! '"I''m sorry," Koschei murmured, looking at her sadly and Rose was glowering at
  the tablet in her hand.'
- ! '"You are not a throwaway, Tomoko!"'
- ! '"It''s what I was made as," she said sadly.'
- ! '"But… it''s not what I choose to be.'
- That is what the revolution was about after all."
- ! '"Well, your revolution sounds wizzard to me!"'
- ! '"I thought about it a lot before I began it," she mused.'
- ! '"It''s coming together better than I expected it would.'
- What happens to Adie?"
- ! '"I''m not positive, I won''t be until Rose finishes her work over there," he
  replied with a shrug.'
- ! '"But, it''s likely that she will become a focus for the power of the Arkytior."'
- ! '"That''s not good, Theta," Koschei pointed out, his face set in a grimace of
  unhappiness.'
- ! '"Will she die?"'
- ! '"I ...'
- Anyone stubborn enough to wear a bloody control collar for a hundred years ought
  to be stubborn enough to survive the Arkytior."
- ! '"So, what about her Anchor?"'
- ! '"Anchor?"'
- ! '"When the Arkytior takes over, I go away, I''m not really part of the equation
  anymore," Susan explained.'
- ! '"Koschei can talk the Arkytior down, deflect her rage, keep me from destroying
  large chunks of galactic real estate, and bring me back to myself, that''s what
  an Anchor is," Susan explained.'
- ! '"The Arkytior is not stupid," the Doctor broke in with a wry look.'
- ! '"She''s infinite, insanely powerful, and not at all remotely human, but she''s
  not stupid.'
- A bondmate of a unique sort, " he explained.
- ! '"The Master too?'
- He is one of these Anchors?"
- ! '"He''s me as well, so, yes," Koschei replied.'
- ! '"Ah, but he lost his Susan, the one being in all the universe he was created
  to serve as the balance for," the Doctor reminded them and the other Time Lords
  looked pained at the reminder.'
- ! '"The thing is, I have lived longer than any other focus has," Susan pointed out.'
- ! '"Most of them are burned out before they ever even reach three hundred, they
  barely have time to grow up, before they are consumed by the energy."'
- ! '"I''m not sure that the Master showing up here wasn''t just the Arkytior deciding
  that Susan needs more balancing than Koschei alone can give her," the Doctor grumbled,
  looking down.'
- ! '"She is, in her own way, utterly ruthless; she wants to come through, so she
  makes it possible and devil take the hindmost."'
- ! '"That''s not entirely fair," Susan objected.'
- ! '"I can feel her ...caring, though that''s such a small word for something so
  vast.'
- She wants connection, yes, but she is aware that other beings have separate existences,
  she just can't always grasp how that works."
- ! '"So, regardless of the Arkytior''s motivations, Adie has made the decision to
  risk firing the Lens.'
- At balance are the lives of at least thirty billion people, if the Manifold breaks
  out where we expect it to."
- ! '"I have to agree with her decision.'
- If I was in her place, I likely would have made the exact same one."
- ! '"Well, you are related to me and I must say that I have made the same choice
  myself, several times," he sighed, looking old, tired, and sad.'
- ! '"It''s not like there are always good options."'
- ! '"Which still doesn''t answer the question, what about her Anchor?"'
- ! '"What about it?"'
- ! '"Is he even alive?"'
- ! '"If he''s not, will she just burn out?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," the Doctor shrugged.'
- ! '"Does the Master know?"'
- ! '"Guinn never knew about the secondary purpose, this is all new to him," she replied
  and Tomoko frowned.'
- ! '"Guinn?"'
- ! '"Would you want to spend your life being called the "Master"?"'
- ! '"No, but I wouldn''t want to be the ''Doctor'', either," she snarked.'
- ! '"I was very young!"'
- ! '"I am going to have fix the environmentals again, they are not converting carbon
  dioxide at a high enough level."'
- ! '"I can help with that," Tomoko said, and moved over to the needed panels.'
- ! '"Could you go down to the scrubbers and see if they''re getting enough water?"'
- ! '"Yeah," she agreed.'
- ! '"Thank you!'
- It's on Level 17, third turn, seventh door, down the stairs and into the sealed
  chamber, wear a mask, because even if you would heal from it, it would be really
  unpleasant, okay?"
- ! '"Radios don''t work in there, too much ionization, so just ask the butterflies
  for help if you need anything."'
- ! '"On it," she said, and left the room, wondering if he''d hit his head on something.'
- ! '"This is really bad, you know that," she told him and he nodded.'
- ! '"If Adie can''t control the power, she could take out huge chunks of the galaxy!"'
- ! '"Excuse me?"'
- ! '"Remember our conversation about ''Really Bad Things?"'
- ! '"Yeah, but you used it and didn''t do that."'
- ! '"That I know of," Susan admitted rather softly.'
- ! '"We''d know!"'
- ! '"If she hasn''t, it''s been because she is extraordinarily stubborn and has a
  very strong anchor," the Doctor pointed out.'
- ! '"Leave the Arkytior to us," she replied, her voice much calmer than she expected
  it would be.'
- ! '"Excuse me?"'
- ! '"I have an Anchor, Adie may not.'
- We'll have to be the ones to deal with the potential damage the Arkytior can cause,"
  Susan answered and he studied her for a while before slowly nodding.
- ! '"Very well."'
- ! '"What about Guinn?"'
- ! '"If we do have to haul Adie back from the fire, we''re likely going to need his
  help as well, but we''ll try to keep him out of it as much as we can.'
- He's still not even partially healed up yet and being exposed like that could really
  damage him."
- ! '"If we have to call him in, we''ll probably already be in over our heads," Susan
  agreed.'
- ! '"Well, one mystery solved," she muttered.'
- ! '"What''s the charge level in here supposed to be?"'
- ! '"Poor thing," she said to it.'
- ! '"Did you used to be a butterfly?'
- I'm sorry he did this to you."
- The final line was a marketing tagline "More real than real and better engineered!"
- ! '"Got it," Tomoko told the butterfly, pulled the misaligned blocks, and began
  rearranging them into the correct sequences.'
- ! '"Right.'
- At least I will be grounded," Tomoko muttered, headed to the hatch, and turned the
  handle.
- ! '"So where are the replacement tubes?"'
- ! '"There''s no plunger here either," she muttered, turning the hasps.'
- ! '"I''ll just laze the damn thing out.'
- I don't want to find out what is in it, it is probably full of discarded eyeballs,"
  she scolded it.
- ! '"Oh there is no way that is paper," she scowled at it, "It would have rotted
  to nothing by now… sec…" She reached into the pouch she had on her belt, unrolled
  the wire she had coiled inside, formed it into a hook, and fished for it.'
- ! '"Lockdown mode," she told Tomoko Construct.'
- ! '"Lockdown mode initiated.'
- All internal transmissions ceased."
- ! '"Translation mode: Gallifreyan to English.'
- Plain-text output."
- ! '"Translating," said Tomoko Construct, and the screen blanked out to a white sheet.'
- ! '"Local database search, Sistron Articles," she said.'
- ! '"Huh," Tomoko pursed her lips.'
- ! '"Local database search: Rassilon."'
- ! '"Rassilon, Lord President of Gallifrey.'
- Text further amended by the Doctor."
- ! '"The Doctor huh?'
- Well, let's try this again."
- ! '"Doctor, you there?"'
- ! '"Tomoko?'
- Nicely done!"
- ! '"Koschei said you were brilliant and he was quite right!"'
- ! '"Er… he did?"'
- ! '"Yes, but I am onto something new now, I need to talk to you, Where are you?."'
- ! '"In a room that seems like a cross between bad Goth poetry night and a medieval
  dungeon," he replied.'
- ! '"That describes all of the rooms," Tomoko snorted.'
- ! '"Let''s meet in the medi-bay, how''s that?"'
- ! '"Meet you there in ten."'
- ! '"Make that five!"'
- ! '"Probably more like seven," she muttered, and headed out.'
- ! '"''Ello, Tomoko!"'
- ! '"Everything in here is black, of course, where do you even get black hospital
  gowns?"'
- ! '"Speciality store, I suppose.'
- Villains' Vestments, the sort of rubbish place that has really modern art that looks
  like a dog's widdle, and uncomfortable couches?"
- ! '"I brought you here because I wanted to talk to you."'
- ! '"Obviously, did you want to exchange jokes?'
- I love a good joke," he told her.
- ! '"This was what was blocking the tubing," she told him.'
- ! '"I remember him, he was one of mother''s students, an expert in Artron energy
  and its relation to Block Transfer Mathematics," he replied.'
- ! '"It makes me sad, the letter," she said simply.'
- ! '"It''s a very sad letter.'
- The number of people who were fed into the grist-mill of Rassilon's ambition is
  terrifying," he replied.
- ! '"It ought to go to you or… somebody.'
- A Time Lord somebody I mean."
- ! '"He has no next of kin, so we''ll give it to Taydin to archive for us, eh?"'
- ! '"Are you busy?"'
- ! '"Oh… hello Susan… I should have expected to see you, just a minute and I can
  come out to you, I''ve got it very cold in here."'
- ! '"I brought a parka," Susan informed her and came inside, shutting the door behind
  her.'
- ! '"Dressing for the occasion, I see," Tomoko said with a smile.'
- ! '"Well, if Muhammad will not come to the mountain, the mountain must come to Muhammad,"
  she explained.'
- ! '"Well, I suppose the first thing I should say is, I''m sorry for scaring you,"
  Tomoko replied.'
- ! '"Are you planning on scaring me?"'
- ! '"No, not if I can help it."'
- ! '"Then there is no reason to apologize.'
- We can only be responsible for ourselves, after all," she shrugged.
- ! '"That said, of course I''m worried.'
- I've watched this play out before, after all, and it doesn't get any easier with
  repetition."
- ! '"Watched what all play out, precisely?"'
- ! '"Watched people blaming Koschei for the Master''s actions, wanting him to pay
  for those sins, wanting to punish him for their own suffering, because the people
  who are ultimately responsible are out of reach.'
- It's easy to take it out on him, even though he was as much as victim as they were,
  because he was there and it was his hands being used," she explained.
- ! '"I think that''s where a lot of us are right now," she said at length.'
- ! '"Look, I….'
- Some of us are angrier than others and some aren't going to be satisfied with anything
  less than knowing that their grievances are going to be addressed."
- ! '"And we don''t have time for that right now, there is the Manifold to deal with,
  and I wanted to try to have… I don''t know, a cooling-off period.'
- For me to cool off."
- ! '"Especially for me to cool off.'
- So, I'm, waiting, I guess."
- ! '"I can understand being mad, he made you, threw you into a Loop and then scooped
  you out and put you in stasis, I''d be mad as well," Susan assured her.'
- ! '"I would have coped with being in stasis," snarked Tomoko.'
- ! '"It was the personality wipe that I hated.'
- I knew it was coming, figured it out months and months ago, had to plan the entire
  revolution knowing that I…" She shrugged, "...
- I was going to end it as a drooling idiot… I programmed Diana-37's notebook with
  a semi-AI construct, just so that I could be brought back to a level of basic functionality
  someday, if my body could ever be recovered."
- ! '"He wiped your personality?"'
- ! '"Of course he did.'
- I knew what I was in for."
- ! '"Eventually, I will get over it, and then I''ll be able to do something productive.'
- But right now…" She shook her head.
- ! '"Right now, big emotional flare-ups risk overheat and subsequent burn-out," she
  ground her teeth.'
- ! '"I am not doing a big emotional flare up.'
- Give me a moment."
- ! '"You may not, but I rather feel like one," Susan growled.'
- ! '"Someday," she confessed, "I would love to be able to scream at something without
  having to be afraid of catching on fire.'
- If and when we eventually have the meeting, I hope that we could just talk."
- ! '"Do you think that working beside him, seeing how he''s changed, will get it
  through to them?"'
- ! '"Because there are people on Gallifrey who, even after six years, still think
  he''ll ''revert to form'' at any minute," she sighed and closed her eyes, looking
  drawn and tired.'
- ! '"How I wish they could see inside his head.'
- If they had any idea..."
- ! '"I know that you''re doing your best, Tomoko, I do.'
- It's just so hard to watch people tear those two down as fast as I fix them."
- ! '"I can sympathize with that position," Tomoko said.'
- ! '"But right now we''re angry, as a rule, and we''re tough, and we''re very well
  armed, and we need to work together to combat a mutual threat.'
- I am just…" She rubbed the back of her neck, "trying to defuse what I can."
- ! '"I''m going to add in a complication for you," Susan sighed.'
- ! '"I''m the conduit for the Arkytior in this generation and they are my anchors.'
- You're hideously vulnerable and I don't want to be turned into a murderer because
  of this."
- ! '"Please do what you have to."'
- ! '"Why yes, of course I can juggle another flaming chainsaw," Tomoko snarked, but
  then nodded.'
- ! '"I''m really sorry about that.'
- I didn't want to add to your burdens, really."
- ! '"That''s all right.'
- With luck, that will avoid Arkytior entanglements too…" She stopped abruptly and
  rubbed the bridge of her nose.
- ! '"Let''s hope it works."'
- ! '"Susan, for my own curiosity…"'
- ! '"Yes?"'
- ! '"This Arkytior thing… how exactly does it work if there is no anchor?"'
- ! '"Without an anchor, I would run the very strong risk of burning up completely,
  probably taking a large chunk of the stellar real estate with me," she sighed, looking
  troubled.'
- ! '"I''d be long dead by now without Koschei.'
- We're already sort of beyond all previous research."
- ! '"And anchors are unique to the conduit, yes?"'
- ! '"Yes, it''s the only situation in which a marriage bond is actually pre-destined."'
- ! '"Do you think you can work in tandem with an unanchored conduit?"'
- ! '"I don''t think that two conduits have ever existed at the same time before,"
  she murmured.'
- ! '"However, I am one of the most powerful telepaths my people have produced in
  a long time, so it''s possible."'
- ! '"So that''s what we''ll do, we''ll coordinate somehow…" Even with the freezing
  temperatures of the room, Tomoko''s temperature was rising as her bright eyes bored
  little holes into the air.'
- ! '"It would take some planning, but I think it could work," Tomoko muttered.'
- ! '"It''s never been done before, there are no precedents, and it could easily kill
  all of us," Susan explained calmly.'
- ! '"You don''t quite understand the forces in play here.'
- However, if you keep trying to run at this level, you're going to burn yourself
  out," Susan told her with a concerned expression.
- ! '"Please be careful."'
- ! '"I struggle with burnout a lot," she sighed, and bumped the temperature down
  again.'
- ! '"There is a way you know, to push you up to being a full Time Lord," she told
  her, looking unhappy.'
- ! '"I''m not sure I want to be a Time Lord," Tomoko replied with a frown.'
- ! '"I don''t want you to do something that would make you unhappy, but the way that
  they structured you is not at all stable," Susan explained.'
- ! '"It may become necessary to bump you up, just to keep you alive."'
- ! '"I can see that.'
- Sort of."
- ! '"Well," Susan murmured and looked around at the freezing cold room and then down
  at where Tomoko''s bare feet were melting the frost.'
- ! '"I''m not quite comfortable with the situation as it is," she replied rather
  diplomatically.'
- ! '"This?'
- Normally, I don't push the envelope this way."
- ! '"Very well," Susan agreed, but her face was rather dubious.'
- ! '"I''ll simply observe normal parameters for a time and discuss it again with
  you later?"'
- ! '"Yes, an observation period is a sound idea, I agree.'
- You can recommend a better medication regimen than the one I am currently following,
  I'm sure."
- ! '"I dislike drugging in situations like this, but if that is the only assistance
  I can give, then very well."'
- ! '"It''s an initial consultation," Tomoko countered.'
- ! '"We see what''s what, then figure out a treatment plan.'
- Isn't that how it is supposed to go?"
- ! '"When someone has a broken arm, you put it in a cast, Tomoko, you don''t just
  give aspirin.'
- You ought to have yourself expanded, that's the proper solution," she replied with
  a wry grimace.
- ! '"Yes, I understand," Tomoko said.'
- ! '"And it may be a step we need to take, I just… " She exhaled slowly.'
- ! '"Too angry to meet with Guinn in a productive way, is too angry to suddenly have
  access to vast cosmic powers.'
- Maybe later, but not now."
- ! '"Time Lords do not have vast cosmic powers, Tomoko!'
- Where did you get such a silly idea?"
- ! '"I met Rassilon, once, before we were all put into the loops.'
- He had come to visit the station and I was part of this presentation that the other
  Time Lords had set up, to show off what they were doing."
- ! '"He asked me a question and didn''t like my answer.'
- I'd have been flushed on the spot except that Adie intervened."
- ! '"When I think of Time Lords, I think of Rassilon.'
- But it's a place I don't want to go when I am angry."
- ! '"You don''t understand at all, Tomoko," Susan sighed and shook her head.'
- ! '"It''s just a different way of seeing the universe, of interacting with it, it
  doesn''t change who you really are.'
- To feel the turn of the world, the passage of time, to hear the Song of my people,
  to see the past and the future spooling out from you, to be able to weigh probabilities
  with a clearer understanding, that's all it is," she explained.
- ! '"In China there was a fashion for a time, for tiny feet," Susan muttered, changing
  the subject suddenly.'
- ! '"One Royal was born with deformed feet, so parents put their infants'' feet in
  metal shoes, never giving them the space to grow.'
- That's what's been done to you, Tomoko, you've been shoved into a tiny metal shoe
  and not allowed to grow."
- ! '"It''s a mutilation, what they did to you, that''s all."'
- ! '"Yes, I…" She shook her head sadly, "I know.'
- I hate the metaphorical metal shoes with a passion, but I desperately want to do
  this first."
- ! '"I understand, I really do, it''s just a risk.'
- I don't want you to flame out."
- ! '"I rather like you, you see."'
- ! '"I rather like you too," she confessed.'
- ! '"That surprises me a little.'
- I've always found relationships to be… difficult to navigate."
- ! '"Well, me too actually," Susan admitted, blowing a lock of hair off her forehead.'
- ! '"I''m not always able to make friends, really.'
- odd."
- ! '"Odd in comparison to what?"'
- ! '"Everybody else.'
- Gypsies are not often welcomed, you know, too broad an outlook, I think," she mused.
- ! '"The only metric which I possess for comparison is ourselves.'
- I think we are odder than you are."
- ! '"I''m an alien avatar of an ancient power, who''s married to two versions of
  the same man, has travelled through time and space, fought in wars that never were,
  and caused both great good and great harm, I''m five hundred years younger than
  both my husbands, who were the childhood friend of my grandfather, I''m living in
  an alternate universe and cloning my race back from the dead."'
- ! '"I was made to be a disposable clone, a throwaway, as a replacement for a Time
  Lord whom Rassilon was reluctant to risk; have never previously travelled anywhere,
  outside of the Loops, have 74 sisters, and am working on extricating ourselves from
  the prisons in which we have been housed.'
- It's just a different sort of odd, really."
- ! '"Yeah, I suppose so," Susan chuckled.'
- ! '"Maybe that''s why we get along so well."'
- ! '"Maybe so.'
- Perhaps that is why I find now that I like it."
- ! '"No, I have gotten along with lots of people, but it''s rare to find someone
  who really understands what it''s like to be perpetually on the outside of everything,
  that never gets old.'
- It would challenge you and give you puzzles to work out and Dar would be challenged
  by you, which would do him good too," Susan mused and nodded.
- ! '"Still, let''s save the universe first and work out your future later," she chuckled.'
- ! '"I agree, thinking session is over, just a minute…" Her eyes rolled up in the
  back of her head for a very brief instant as her aura noticeably dimmed.'
- ! '"Brrr… let me fix the temperature back to normal and I will walk out with you,"
  she said, walking a not-exactly-straight line to the control.'
- ! '"You''ve dropped your metabolism and upped your serotonin significantly, your
  heartbeat is slower and your brain activity has dropped," she murmured with interest.'
- ! '"That''s clever of you, did you hack the slug?"'
- ! '"The slug was the very first thing I ever hacked," she smiled at her.'
- ! '"It allows me to go a long way in temperature control."'
- ! '"Yes, I can see that.'
- ! '"It''s funny, you and I are a lot alike and we have the same problem.'
- The potential of going up in flames," Susan mused and opened the door, stepping
  into the hall.
- ! '"Guinn and I will be heading over to my TARDIS, while you pick up the others.'
- prudent," she explained.
- ! '"Koschei is staying here for a while, to help with the repairs."'
- ! '"And to let the others all see him and get used to him," Tomoko added and Susan
  grinned.'
- ! '"Yes, that too.'
- I just don't think that Guinn is ready to face them yet, that's all."
- ! '"They''re not ready to face him either," Tomoko agreed and Susan nodded.'
- ! '"No.'
- You're doing well though," Susan pointed out.
- ! '"I have to do well.'
- There is no other option," Tomoko admitted and Susan smiled at her.
- ! '"I really do like you," she admitted, her smile broadening.'
- ! '"I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship."'
- ! '"Environmental is up to Ninety-eighty percent efficiency," he told Tomoko.'
- ! '"Rotor is functioning again now, we''re good to go."'
- ! '"Anything else you would like me to check on?'
- We'll eventually need them for the Lens."
- ! '"Don''t we need two for that?"'
- ! '"Not necessarily, we''re already in, we just need to move around a bit," Koschei
  told her and she nodded.'
- ! '"We have Diana-37''s coordinates and Loop, so we can pick them all up any time,"
  Tomoko reminded them.'
- ! '"Right," the Doctor agreed.'
- ! '"Ready when you are then," she smiled at them.'
- ! '"Right, let''s go gather Mashas!"'
- ! '"Will you be okay?"'
- ! '"Of course I will be," he assured her and kissed her again.'
- ! '"You two get to work on the Nanites and stay safe, all right."'
- ! '"Go on, get moving, we can''t start the party till you''re gone, after all,"
  he teased.'
- ! '"The Doctor promised to talk about nothing but engineering for the next six hours!"'
- ! '"But, that sounds like fun!"'
- ! '"That''s them," said Tomoko, then headed to the door.'
- ! '"Give us ninety minutes to talk and then I''ll bring them back down."'
- ! '"Stay here.'
- Don't come out.."
- ! '"She does know that we''re Time Lords, right?'
- Veterans of the Time War, nearly two thousand years of experience between us?"
- ! '"Right."'
- ! '"Don''t really feel like going out right now," he decided.'
- ! '"I choose to stay here."'
- ! '"Tomoko-6, in range," announced Tomoko Construct.'
- ! '"Right, I see a TARDIS down there, let''s get the Amazons moving, okay?"'
- ! '"No," said Tomoko Construct.'
- ! '"Tomoko-6 has designated this as a meeting spot.'
- She has called for a conference prior to returning to the TARDIS."
- ! '"That''s cool," Jake said, shrugged, and sat down on a rock, eyes roaming the
  area for any signs of danger.'
- ! '"OK, folks, listen up!'
- Some of this is going to be extremely unpleasant."
- ! '"Are you telling us," said Maureen-65 at last.'
- ! '"That the Master is still alive?"'
- ! '"Not only is he still alive, he is working with the Time Lords, and we are going
  to need him.'
- All of us."
- ! '"This could get ugly," Masha-37 whispered into his ear and he nodded.'
- ! '"Hey," he called loudly and stood up.'
- ! '"What do you want more, freedom or revenge?"'
- ! '"Because, right now, you can''t have both.'
- Well, the price for that is to wait for a while."
- ! '"Tomoko just said that the universe is in danger, that people''s lives are at
  stake.'
- In the end, this is your choice; will you be weapons or will you become so much
  more than that?"
- ! '"The price for our help was that when this is over we will have a meeting with
  him," she explained and several faces relaxed.'
- ! '"But, that can''t happen till this is done, okay?'
- So, no one comes on board, unless you agree that we are not going to harm him,"
  Tomoko-6 bit out, holding up her hands for silence, "He has been effectively neutered.
- Are we agreed?"
- ! '"Are we agreed?"'
- ! '"Let''s get the fuck out of here, Amazons!"'
- ! '"Cause I am sick of crab!"'
- ! '"That was amazing," she told Jake as they ran.'
- ! '"The way you talked them all down.'
- I am so proud of you!"
- ! '"That''s my job, Angel, Head of Field Operations, Torchwood.'
- Personnel management comes with that," he murmured.
- ! '"Now, let''s blow that thing and go home, I''d like you to be able to ravish
  me in comfort."'
- ! '"That will never happen," she growled, "Because I am going to tie you up and
  make you mine."'
- She gave him her best "grrrr" face, then kissed him back.
- ! '"I meant your comfort, Angel, not mine," he grinned.'
- ! '"But you are what makes it comfortable," she said, with a wide happy smile.'
- ! '"Love you," he whispered and held her hand tightly in his as they headed to freedom.'
- ! '"What do you think she''s saying to them?"'
- ! '"Would you please be so kind as to refrain from lynching Guinn, at least until
  after we''ve saved the universe?"'
- ! '"Now now, you know that Tomoko has no interest in killing Guinn," the Doctor
  chided.'
- ! '"She''s been really rather forgiving and compassionate, really."'
- ! '"Yeah, but she''s not the only one we have to worry about," Rose countered.'
- ! '"Neveah would like to take him apart with her bare hands, no rope necessary."'
- ! '"She''s not the only one either, Sara, Tyler, and Evie aren''t thrilled with
  the ceasefire, promise of ''future justice'' or no," Koschei agreed.'
- ! '"But they all like you," the Doctor shot back and pointed at Koschei.'
- ! '"You''re the other version of him and they all rather like you.'
- The more they are around you and the longer this goes on, the less they will want
  to kill him."
- ! '"A good point," Rose agreed, nodding thoughtfully.'
- ! '"Besides, if all else fails we have our secret weapon."'
- ! '"Our secret weapon?"'
- ! '"Susan."'
- ! '"All she ever has to do is start pleading with people, tears in her eyes, face
  all sad and a little disappointed, and they fall in line.'
- I mean Andred couldn't bring himself to hurt you and he hates you!"
- ! '"He doesn''t actually, not anymore," Rose interjected.'
- ! '"He''s having a hard time relaxing and just trusting that you really are not
  the Master anymore, but he doesn''t hate you."'
- ! '"No, he just expects me to twirl my moustache and cackle and try to take over
  the universe," Koschei shrugged and Rose grinned at him.'
- ! '"Silly man, you''ve got your hands full already!'
- Keeping the Doctor out of trouble is a full time occupation," she teased and the
  Doctor pouted.
- ! '"Yeah, but I''m the only one doing that," Koschei snarked.'
- ! '"You keep getting him into more!"'
- ! '"Well," Rose replied with wide innocent eyes.'
- ! '"Anything I can do to keep the universe safe from your evil machinations..."'
- ! '"You two are perfect for each other," Koschei scolded, but he was more amused
  than upset and the Doctor and Rose both grinned.'
- ! '"Yeah," she agreed and the Doctor took her hand.'
- ! '"Quite right," he murmured.'
- ! '"I didn''t calculate properly for Jake''s presence," said Tomoko when she came
  into the TARDIS a full forty-five minutes early.'
- ! '"You don''t mind if we are early, do you?"'
- ! '"No, Koschei was winning, so really, you''re just in time!"'
- ! '"Hello!"'
- ! '"Jake!'
- I'm so glad that you're not an old man!"
- ! '"Me too," he agreed.'
- ! '"Any reason why I might be?"'
- ! '"We got worried about the time differential, with you being in there so long!"'
- ! '"Well, it''s been two years, Rose," he admitted and she looked miserable.'
- ! '"Oh, Jake!"'
- ! '"It''s okay, I''ve made some amazing new friends," he told her and gestured at
  the Mashas.'
- ! '"Wow!'
- That's amazing!"
- ! '"So glad to see you both back safe!"'
- ! '"Of course I am back safe," Diana-37 said.'
- ! '"I told you I would be fine!"'
- ! '"Right, So, this is the Doctor, Koschei, and Rose," Diana introduced the Mashas
  to the Time Lords.'
- ! '"We managed to find twenty-seven of them, total," she added and the Doctor nodded.'
- ! '"So, only forty-six to go!"'
- ! '"Are you all right?"'
- ! '"Of course, they hardly let me have any fun at all," he informed her, gesturing
  at the Mashas.'
- ! '"Practically sat on me when things got hairy."'
- ! '"Someone had to keep you out of trouble," a grim faced Masha informed her.'
- ! '"Moira-3," she introduced herself.'
- ! '"Yes, ma''am," Jake replied, smiling at Moira.'
- ! '"Uh, hi, I''m Adie," she replied.'
- ! '"Yes, we know who you are," Moira-3 replied, eyeing her with interest before
  she walked off to look at the rest of the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Don''t mind her, she''s been in a Loop for about two thousand years," Jake explained.'
- ! '"I''ve been afraid of the time differentials."'
- ! '"Yes, that is just one of our problems," Tomoko said easily.'
- ! '"But: first things first.'
- Let's get everyone fed, cleaned, and clothed, and then we can see about picking
  up the rest…"
- ! '"What are you going to do about the Auto-Gravity System?"'
- ! '"Repair it?"'
- ! '"I''m Koschei," he introduced and she nodded.'
- ! '"Zoi-29," she responded.'
- ! '"If we take out the redundant circuits on the particle analysis spectrometer,
  we can use those to repair the Auto-Gravity System," she told him and he nodded.'
- ! '"Yes, we could, but you''ll need to recalibrate the B-34z conduits though, they
  aren''t set up to handle that sort of load," he replied, grateful to have a conversation
  with someone that made sense to him.'
- ! '"Do we have the equipment for that?"'
- ! '"An...'
- Ion Lathe," she choked out and Koschei nodded, understanding perfectly.
- ! '"Yeah.'
- I know," he replied and put an arm around her shoulders.
- ! '"It''s beautiful, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"You want to help me mill some of the pieces?"'
- ! '"Is she all right?"'
- ! '"She''s an engineer, of course not," he teased and Tomoko shook her head and
  chuckled.'
- ! '"Here," she said, and put the cloth down on the table.'
- ! '"This is… um… from some of the Master''s, I guess we could call it personal stock?'
- We'll need a bunch of them to pull off the Lens run," She winked at him, then slipped
  from the room again.
- ! 'There was a note on it: "74 girl suits, 1 boy suit needed."'
- ! '"That''s going to be a pain to replicate, we''ll probably need to refill the
  bins several times and add some more processing power to handle it," Zoi muttered
  and Koschei grinned at her.'
- ! '"You''re on a TARDIS, Zoi," he reminded her and with a flourish he pulled back
  a wall panel to reveal several heavy duty data ports.'
- ! '"We have processing power to spare."'
- ! '"I love this place!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"They''ve noticed us," he replied and Jake watched as a couple of large beetles
  trundled over the top of a nearby hill, heading towards the two TARDIS.'
- ! '"Bugger that for a lark," Jake sighed and the Doctor nodded.'
- ! '"Susan''s TARDIS can''t move yet," Rose pointed out.'
- ! '"Well have to see if we can''t discourage them from eating us, then," the Doctor
  muttered.'
- ! '"Give them indigestion at least."'
- ! '"On it."'
- ! '"Tomoko!'
- We have incoming!"
- ! '"How many?"'
- ! '"Two beetles immediately visible, about car sized."'
- ! '"Two thousand years or so, all I fought was one enemy," she grumbled.'
- ! '"Not sure what sort of tactics to use on a bug."'
- ! '"They''re just tanks, really," Madison pointed out.'
- ! '"Right," Moira sighed.'
- ! '"What''s a tank?"'
- ! '"Roll ''em over and smash ''em," she told her sisters and they both nodded.'
- ! '"Nikki, you watch our six, Neveah flank right, I''ll go left," she instructed,
  hoping that all the months she''d been pounding the idea of teamwork into their
  heads would pay off.'
- ! '"Damn," Diana grumbled, this always happened with her.'
- ! '"I was on it!"'
- ! '"We work as a team!"'
- ! '"Nev!"'
- ! '"I''ll get her to Susan!"'
- ! '"Evie!'
- Get out of…" but her voice trailed away and her own head began tilting back and
  forth, back and forth.
- ! '"Koschei!'
- Doctor!"
- ! '"I''ve got Mashas going off-line, it''s something psychic, do something!"'
- ! '"It doesn''t quite work that way!"'
- ! '"Got it!"'
- ! '"Thank you," Tomoko said to Susan.'
- ! '"It was two beetles and three wasps, and we''re down three quarters of our forces."'
- ! '"The Rani was insane, but not really stupid," Susan sighed out.'
- ! '"Barmy cow."'
- ! '"We can''t do another fight like this, we''ll have to draw them out of the area…
  let me talk to Koschei."'
- ! '"She''ll be fine," she told him bracingly.'
- ! '"Yeah," he murmured, looking unhappy and somewhat unconvinced.'
- ! '"Trust me," Susan teased him softly, giving his shoulder a small shake.'
- ! '"I''m a really good doctor."'
- ! '"Wow, you look like hell… you OK?'
- Here, I brought you some tea."
- ! '"Thank you," he replied a bit wryly.'
- ! '"I feel like hell."'
- ! '"I need bait, Koschei.'
- Any suggestions?"
- ! '"We ran up against two beetles and three wasps and just about everyone is down
  because of it.'
- We can't do another fight like this."
- ! '"Um...'
- metals?"
- ! '"That seems to be their only real interest."'
- ! '"If he still has it, there was a bunch of stuff in the storerooms that you could
  use."'
- ! '"I''ll put something together, see if I can get us a clear patch, at least for
  a while."'
- ! '"How you holding up?"'
- ! '"Too much to do to really think about it," he chuckled.'
- ! '"Got to get both of them up and running, or we''ll never get out of the Loops,"
  he explained and then dived back under the console.'
- ! '"Right, I''ll leave you to it… thanks for the tip, I''ll check the store rooms."'
- ! '"''Ello, dear," Rose said with a smile.'
- ! '"We''re looking for the exact right gift for a giant metal hungry bug."'
- ! '"So was I," Tomoko murmured in surprise.'
- ! '"Great minds and all that," the Doctor chuckled and kept sorting.'
- ! '"It didn''t attack," the Doctor mused.'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"I''m scanning with passive sensors," he explained softly.'
- ! '"I''m wondering if it''s active emissions that set it off."'
- ! '"It hasn''t shown the faintest interest in biting me," she pointed out, though
  she had her weapon ready in the other hand.'
- At the moment, it was acting for all the world like a biological cricket, turning
  in slow circles and occasionally rubbing its legs together to make a sort of metallic
  "cheep" noise.
- ! '"No, it''s not at all interested in either of us," the Doctor agreed.'
- ! '"They are designed to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, gathering mass and processing
  power, this one is so tiny, the base unit, could it be that it requires greater
  intelligence for them to recognize a threat?"'
- ! '"They spend hours and hours like this," she told the Doctor, while turning the
  cricket around on her finger tip.'
- ! '"Just flitting about, minding their own business, and not caring in the slightest
  about humans or Time Lords or TARDIS, or anything else.'
- But what causes it?"
- ! '"The correct set of triggers obviously," the Doctor agreed.'
- ! '"Which we aren''t giving them, just now.'
- It would be rather nice to know how not to annoy them."
- ! '"Yes, it would," Tomoko sighed.'
- ! '"What''s that?'
- A Wasp's nest?"
- ! '"They''re making cells," Tomoko murmured and the Doctor nodded.'
- ! '"Why a spiral?"the Doctor asked and then looked at Tomoko with a raised eyebrow.'
- ! '"That''s a bit odd and far more symmetrical than any biological insect would
  make it.'
- It's like a mechanical rendering of the perfect wasp's nest."
- ! '"They couldn''t care less about us either," she murmured gesturing at the wasps.'
- ! '"We''re missing something here, something vital," the Doctor agreed.'
- ! '"I know, but I can''t think what it might be."'
- ! '"We''re lacking data," he sighed.'
- ! '"It''s always a mistake to theorize without data.'
- Maybe it will come to us."
- ! '"Hello, you two, I''ve found a tiny little ray of hope," he told them "But, it''s
  really tiny."'
- ! '"I''ll take it… what have you got?"'
- ! '"Interesting," he murmured and Koschei shook his head in amusement.'
- ! '"The oscillating shields, the frequency that bumped the last locusts off, it
  appears to be a weakness.'
- Mind you, once we use it, they'll adapt and evolve and it won't be any use anymore,
  but it might give us one good shot," the Doctor explained.
- ! '"It''s better than nothing."'
- ! '"How are you doing?"'
- ! '"They nearly killed my wife," he pointed out.'
- ! '"Right now?'
- I'm a bit angry."
- ! '"She''ll be all right," she said.'
- ! '"Of course she will," the Doctor replied, with an airy wave.'
- ! '"My granddaughter is an excellent doctor, but I am still rather put out that
  she was in such a situation at all.'
- The Rani is very lucky that she's dead right now," he said, his voice calm, but
  his eyes blazing.
- ! '"So, you''ve come around to our more violent point of view?"'
- ! '"I would have preferred to have found another way, you know that," he replied
  and Koschei nodded.'
- ! '"I do, but I don''t think that there was much we could do, really."'
- ! '"They''re pretty, aren''t they?"'
- ! '"From a distance.'
- For insects, I mean."
- ! '"Yes, utterly beautiful, it''s a shame that they''re so horribly destructive.'
- She could have done so much good with them,"the Doctor sighed.
- ! '"There''s something…" She shook her head.'
- ! '"Something is there, and we are missing it.'
- But I can't quite grasp it."
- ! '"Like what?"'
- ! '"Something about how they behave, there has to be an underlying logic to it all,
  a pattern to explain their observable behaviour," she replied.'
- ! '"It''ll come to us.'
- Hopefully, before we are all eaten," the Doctor replied cheerfully.
- ! '"One would hope," she scowled, and settled down to work.'
- ! '"This isn''t working," Koschei complained.'
- ! '"What isn''t working?"'
- ! '"Guinn over there working on Susan''s TARDIS, while the rest of us are over here,"
  the Doctor sighed out.'
- ! '"It would go faster if we fixed this one completely and then all went over to
  fix hers together."'
- ! '"It would," Koschei agreed.'
- ! '"But...'
- the Mashas...," Rose murmured.
- ! '"Will be fine," Diana assured them as she came in.'
- ! '"I, for one, am kind of curious to see what he''s like these days."'
- ! '"What about the others, some of them really want to string him up," Rose pointed
  out.'
- ! '"No," Diana replied.'
- ! '"They want to string up the Master.'
- I think that once they realize that the Master is gone forever, they'll get over
  that."
- ! '"I''m not sure I''m willing to risk his life on that assumption," Rose argued,
  but Diana shook her head.'
- ! '"You won''t be.'
- They won't break that promise," Diana replied.
- ! '"Susan will be pretty worried, can you go tell her?"'
- ! '"We need your help over here and the Mashas have promised not to kill you," the
  Doctor informed him and Guinn winced before nodding.'
- ! '"I''m on my way," he said softly and Diana''s face was thoughtful as the image
  faded.'
- ! '"Hello, love," she murmured and he buried his face in her hair for a moment,
  before gently releasing her and straightening.'
- ! '"I''ll get to work on those systems, shall I," he murmured softly and looked
  down at the floor, feeling overwhelmed and rather ashamed of himself.'
- ! '"You heard the man.'
- We have repairs to make."
- ! '"Go on."'
- ! '"When is the Doctor coming back for you?"'
- ! '"Sick of me already, mom?"'
- ! '"Of course not," Joyce smirked back.'
- ! '"I was just wondering.'
- It's been a while since he left you here after your honeymoon."
- ! '"I told him I wanted to visit with you longer than an hour, so he left me here
  to have some mom time," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"And it''s been long enough that I got to Aaron a couple of times, too."'
- ! '"That''s what I mean," Joyce sighed, making Olivia frown at her in wonder, Joyce
  drying her hands with a dish towel and facing Olivia as she dried the dishes.'
- ! '"He married you, took you on your honeymoon then dumped you here saying he''d
  be right back."'
- ! '"He didn''t dump me here, mom," Olivia sighed, putting the dish she''d been drying
  away.'
- ! '"I just told you I wanted a visit with you."'
- ! '"Then why didn''t he stay to visit with me too?"'
- ! '"Because you''re my mom.'
- At least this time I know he's coming back."
- ! '"Do you?"'
- ! '"I''ll get it," Olivia ground out before marching toward the door to open it,
  revealing the mailman standing at the door.'
- ! '"Olivia Felton?"'
- ! '"That''s me," she frowned in wonder then noticed the box in his hands with a
  letter attached to it before he handed it to her.'
- ! '"Package for you," he smiled, making her smile back with a nod as she took the
  package and letter.'
- ! '"Thanks," she smiled before he walked away and she shut the door, turning to
  head back into the kitchen.'
- ! '"What''s that?"'
- ! '"Not sure," she replied, sitting at the table and using the scissors on the box
  first, setting the letter aside as Joyce sat at the table as well.'
- ! '"I thought you already had one of those," Joyce recalled as Olivia lifted the
  wand reverently to examine it.'
- ! '"Lost the last one," Olivia replied, looking to the letter.'
- ! '"Melted in a Cyberman''s head.'
- Long story."
- ! '"What''s the ''two'' for?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," she murmured, deftly as she pulled the card from the envelope
  and read it, smirking, "Date, time and map reference in a TARDIS blue envelope.'
- Oh, Doctor, you still surprise me."
- ! '"What''s that mean?"'
- ! '"It means, I''m gonna go meet the Doctor," she smirked, standing and heading
  to the stairs leading to the bedrooms.'
- ! '"Why doesn''t he just pick you up?"'
- ! '"Stop questioning my husband''s motives, mom!"'
- Olivia called without malice as she hurried up the stairs to pack, muttering, "I
  think even he doesn't know what his motives are."
- ! '"Goin'' my way, little lady?"'
- ! '"That depends," Olivia smirked back in a Southern accent as well, sauntering
  across the street toward him.'
- ! '"I''m lookin'' for my husband.'
- Seen him around?"
- ! '"Hm, sounds familiar," he smiled back as she stopped in front of him.'
- ! '"You kinda look like him, ya know?"'
- ! '"Well, that certainly makes it easier for me to sweep you off your feet and steal
  you away from him," he smirked back, his normal accent returning.'
- ! '"Theta, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"I just…missed you," he smiled and moved in for another kiss but she placed her
  fingers on his lips, making him frown again.'
- ! '"Ok, I know you said you''d almost never lie to me, but you could start the truth
  part right about now."'
- ! '"I know," he grumbled, fiddling with her fingers before looking up at her.'
- ! '"It''s…been longer for me than it has for you."'
- ! '"What do you mean?"'
- ! '"I''m older, Liv.'
- Over one thousand."
- ! '"And you''ve never looked better.'
- I'm suspecting you're trying to distract me from what's really bothering you."
- ! '"I can''t tell you."'
- Olivia frowned in confusion and breathed, "Why?"
- ! '"You''re gonna find out soon enough, my love," he replied, lifting a hand to
  stroke her cheek as she still frowned at him in absolute confusion.'
- ! '"And I''m sorry…but it''s going to get hard for you."'
- ! '"Theta—?"'
- ! '"Howdy!"'
- he grinned behind her, making her frown in wonder and turn around to see Amy and
  Rory coming toward them, but the Doctor murmured into her ear, "I know this isn't
  over, just bare with me."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"It''s the Ponds!"'
- ! '"Someone''s been a busy boy, then, eh?"'
- ! '"Did you see me?"'
- ! '"Of course!"'
- ! '"Stalker!"'
- ! '"Flirt!"'
- ! '"Husband," Rory cut in.'
- ! '"Rory the Roman!"'
- ! '"Did I miss something?"'
- ! '"When did you see him?"'
- ! '"Oh, he''s been causing trouble in history to get our attention," Amy replied
  as they both frowned at each other.'
- ! '"Didn''t you see him?"'
- ! '"I…wasn''t really looking," Olivia admitted.'
- ! '"Nice hat," Rory smiled at the Doctor.'
- ! '"I wear a Stetson now," the Doctor smirked.'
- ! '"Stetsons are cool."'
- ! '"Hello, Sweetie," she smirked.'
- ! '"River!"'
- ! '"Good to see you, Olivia," River smiled, hugging her in return.'
- ! '"Right!"'
- ! '"Everyone in the car!'
- I'll drive!"
- ! '"No you won''t," Olivia retorted, snatching the keys from his hand when he held
  them up.'
- ! '"I''ll drive.'
- Everyone in the car!"
- ! '"Right, then, where are we?"'
- ! '"Have we done Easter Island yet?"'
- ! '"Um…" the Doctor hummed, flipping through his book as River flipped through hers,
  Olivia peeking at it over his shoulder but he pulled it back to frown at her, making
  her stick her tongue out at him before he looked back to his book.'
- ! '"Yes!'
- I've got Easter Island."
- ! '"They worshipped you there," River smiled, making Olivia frown between them in
  wonder.'
- ! '"Have you seen the statues?"'
- ! '"Jim the Fish," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- How is he?"
- ! '"Still building his dam," the Doctor smirked, wrapping an arm around Olivia''s
  shoulders as she frowned between them.'
- ! '"I…I don''t get it," she whispered.'
- ! '"When did you get that book and when did you do all of this, and why didn''t
  you tell me?"'
- ! '"It''ll be explained later, Liv," he whispered into her ear before kissing her
  temple.'
- ! '"I promise."'
- ! '"Sorry, what are you two doing?"'
- ! '"They''re both time travelers, so they never meet in the right order," Amy replied.'
- ! '"They''re syncing their diaries."'
- ! '"So, what''s happening?"'
- ! '"Obviously you''re up to something."'
- ! '"I''ve been running," he began, threading his fingers through Olivia''s hair,
  absentmindedly.'
- ! '"Faster than I''ve ever run, and I''ve been running my whole life.'
- And tonight, I'm going to need you all with me."
- ! '"Ok," Amy replied without hesitation but Olivia felt a weight to his words and
  exchanged a glance with River who seemed to feel the same thing.'
- ! '"We''re here.'
- What's up?"
- ! '"A picnic," he smiled.'
- ! '"And then a trip.'
- Somewhere different, somewhere…brand new."
- ! '"Where?"'
- ! '"Space," he smirked.'
- ! '"1969."'
- ! '"Salud!"'
- ! '"So, when are we going to 1969?"'
- ! '"And since when do you drink wine?"'
- ! '"I''m one thousand, one hundred and three.'
- I must've drunk it sometime," the Doctor replied.
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"I told you I was older," he recalled.'
- ! '"Yeah, but when you said over one thousand I thought one thousand and three,
  not…another hundred years after that!"'
- ! '"Oh…sorry," he muttered before taking a drink as Olivia frowned at him in absolute
  confusion before he spit the wine out, making her roll her eyes at him when he sneered,
  "Ew!'
- I thought it would taste more like the gums."
- ! '"I''m with Olivia," Amy agreed.'
- ! '"You were nine hundred and eight the last time we saw you."'
- ! '"And you''ve put on a couple of pounds.'
- I wasn't going to mention it," the Doctor retorted.
- ! '"Who''s that?"'
- ! '"Who''s who?"'
- ! '"Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"You said you saw something?"'
- ! '"No, I didn''t," Amy frowned in wonder, making Olivia frown as well.'
- ! '"The moon!"'
- ! '"Look at it!'
- Quite right."
- ! '"The moon landing was in ''69," Rory recalled.'
- ! '"Is that where we''re going?"'
- ! '"No," the Doctor murmured as Olivia craned her neck to look at him as he spoke.'
- ! '"A lot more happens in ''69 than anyone remembers."'
- Olivia frowned as he wrapped his arms around her and hugged her tightly as he resumed,
  "Human beings…I thought I'd never get done saving you."
- ! '"My love, what''s wrong," she asked him, silently.'
- ! '"I''m getting really nervous."'
- ! '"I know," he replied.'
- ! '"You''ve always been perceptive, Liv.'
- It's one of the things I love about you."
- ! '"Who''s he?"'
- ! '"Oh, my god," River breathed, looking to the lake and turning everyone''s attention
  to it.'
- ! '"What…the…?"'
- ! '"You all need to stay back," the Doctor ordered, gripping Olivia''s hand and
  pulling her ahead a few steps before letting it go and turning to face his friends.'
- ! '"Whatever happens now, you do not interfere.'
- River, keep an eye on Olivia."
- ! '"You''re going to have to be strong, Liv.'
- Promise me."
- ! '"I…I promise," she whispered and fought the urge to head after him as he turned
  to march toward the astronaut.'
- ! '"That''s an astronaut," Rory stated the obvious, none of them taking their eyes
  off the Doctor.'
- ! '"That''s an Apollo astronaut in a lake."'
- ! '"What''s he doing?"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"The Doctor said stay back!"'
- ! '"River!'
- Let me go!"
- ! '"I''m sorry," she saw him say before they all saw his regeneration begin…but
  the astronaut shot him again, sending him to the ground.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Of course not," River murmured, catching Olivia''s hearing but she said nothing
  as her focus remained on the lifeless Doctor.'
- ! '"Theta," Olivia whispered, shuffling in the sand to lift his head and set it
  in her lap, stroking his face gently as Amy sobbed next to her.'
- ! '"You promised you wouldn''t leave me alone.'
- You promised."
- ! '"He can''t be dead," Amy sobbed, curled into a ball as she rocked back and forth
  next to him.'
- ! '"This isn''t possible."'
- ! '"Whatever that was, it killed him in the middle of his regeneration cycle," River
  explained.'
- ! '"His body was already dead.'
- He didn't make it to the next one."
- ! '"Maybe he''s a clone or a duplicate or something," Amy insisted.'
- ! '"I believe I can save you some time," the old man from the van said, suddenly
  standing right next to them holding a gas can.'
- ! '"That most definitely is the Doctor.'
- And he is most definitely dead."
- He set the can down, saying, "He said you'd need this."
- ! '"Gasoline?"'
- ! '"A Time Lord''s body is a miracle, even a dead one," River replied through sniffles.'
- ! '"There are empires out there who''d rip this world apart for just one cell.'
- We can't leave him here, or anywhere."
- ! '"Wake up," Olivia shuddered, her hands on either side of his head, fisting his
  hair.'
- ! '"Wake up, you idiot.'
- Wake up!"
- ! '"What do we do, Rory?"'
- ! '"We''re his friends," River replied her voice thick with emotion, lifting the
  gas can.'
- ! '"We do what the Doctor''s friends always do: As we''re told."'
- ! '"There''s a boat," Rory reported, noticing the rowboat on the shoreline.'
- ! '"If we''re gonna do this, let''s do it properly."'
- ! '"Why, River?"'
- ! '"Why didn''t you let me go to him?"'
- ! '"Don''t do this, Olivia," River warned, but Olivia gently moved the Doctor''s
  head from her lap and stood to march toward River.'
- ! '"I could have saved him.'
- Why didn't you let me?!"
- ! '"The Doctor told us not to interfere!"'
- ! '"And since when do you and me ever do what he tells us, River, huh?!"'
- ! '"Always!"'
- ! '"We just don''t think we do!'
- We would follow him to the ends of the Earth, but the only way we've gotten this
  far is if we listen to him and you know it!"
- ! '"Stop it!'
- Both of you!"
- ! '"The Doctor wouldn''t want this!"'
- Olivia lowered her glare from River and nodded in agreement before murmuring, "I'm…sorry.
- I just…"
- ! '"I know," River nodded, stepping toward her to wrap an arm around her, still
  holding the gas can as Olivia turned to sob into her shoulder.'
- ! '"Me too."'
- ! '"Olivia," River whispered from behind her and she felt a hand on her shoulder.'
- Knowing it was River's she lifted a hand to grasp her fingers, keeping them on her
  shoulder as she murmured, "Follow me."
- ! '"Where are we going?"'
- ! '"Just follow me," River repeated, her grip lightly tightening on her shoulder.'
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"Why did you come?"'
- ! '"The same reason as you," he replied, pulling a blue envelope from his jacket
  and holding it up.'
- ! '"Three and five," Olivia whispered, reading the numbers on them as they all stared
  at the man in wonder.'
- ! '"Doctor Song," he greeted.'
- ! '"Olivia, Amy, Rory.'
- Won't be seeing you again, but you'll be seeing me."
- ! '"Five," Olivia said.'
- ! '"Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"The Doctor numbered the envelopes," she explained.'
- ! '"You got four," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"River got three, I got two, Canton got five."'
- ! '"So?"'
- ! '"So, where''s one?"'
- ! '"Exactly," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"What, you think he invited someone else?"'
- ! '"He must have," River insisted.'
- ! '"He planned all of this, down to the last detail."'
- ! '"Will you three shut up?'
- It doesn't matter," Amy breathed.
- ! '"He was up to something," Olivia continued.'
- ! '"He''s dead," Amy breathed.'
- ! '"What did he mean by ''Space.'
- 1969.'?"
- ! '"You''re still talking but it doesn''t matter," Amy told them, bitterly.'
- ! '"Hey, it mattered to him," Rory reminded her.'
- ! '"So it matters to us," River added.'
- ! '"He''s dead," Amy whispered again.'
- ! '"But he still needs us," River reminded her as Olivia looked around the diner,
  River and Rory stepping toward Amy.'
- ! '"I know, Amy, I know.'
- But right now, we have to focus."
- ! '"River, look!"'
- ! '"Excuse me, who was sitting over there?"'
- ! '"Some guy," he replied.'
- ! '"The Doctor knew he was coming to his death, so he sent out messages," River
  said as they all crowded around the table.'
- ! '"When you know it''s the end, who do you call?"'
- ! '"Your friends, people you trust," Rory replied.'
- ! '"Number one," Olivia read on the envelope.'
- ! '"Who did he trust the most?"'
- ! '"This is cold," River blurted.'
- ! '"Even by your standards, this is cold."'
- ! '"Or ''Hello!'''
- as people used to say," the Doctor retorted, still smiling and now holding his straw
  in his hand.
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"I just popped out to get my special straw," he explained.'
- ! '"It adds more fizz."'
- Amy stepped toward him, circling him and he circled her in confusion as she smiled
  in a breath, "You're ok.
- How can you be ok?"
- ! '"Hey, of course I''m ok," he frowned, wrapping his arms around her to hug her
  close, sensing she needed it.'
- ! '"I''m always ok.'
- Forget that title."
- He let go of Amy to step toward Rory, hugging him as he said, "Rory the Roman!
- Hello, Rory."
- He let him go and turned to River, resuming, "And Doctor River Song.
- What trouble have you got for me this time?"
- ! '"I''m assuming that''s for something I haven''t done yet?"'
- ! '"Yes, it is," she ground out and a nod.'
- ! '"Good.'
- Looking forward to that," he muttered before looking to Olivia who was staring at
  him as well and he straightened himself out.
- ! '"Well, I suppose you''re gonna slap me too, eh?"'
- ! '"Liv, are you ok?"'
- ! '"You look pale, and…have you been crying?'
- Darling, what—?"
- ! '"And is this for something I haven''t done yet?"'
- ! '"Yes," Olivia shuddered.'
- ! '"Again…looking forward to that," he repeated.'
- ! '"I don''t understand," Rory confessed, making the Doctor look to him again.'
- ! '"How can you be here?"'
- ! '"I was invited," the Doctor retorted, pulling his envelope from Olivia''s hand.'
- ! '"Date, map reference.'
- Same as you lot, I assume, otherwise, it's a hell of a coincidence."
- ! '"River, what''s going on?"'
- ! '"Amy, ask him what age he is," River ordered.'
- ! '"That''s a bit personal," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"Everyone be quiet," Olivia shuddered.'
- ! '"I''m listening to hear his hearts."'
- ! '"Liv, honestly, loving this, but I think you need to let go now," he murmured.'
- ! '"Tell her," River ordered the Doctor.'
- ! '"Tell her what age you are."'
- ! '"Nine hundred and nine," he replied, making Olivia hug him even tighter.'
- ! '"Yeah, but you said you were—"'
- ! '"So where does that leave us then, huh?"'
- ! '"Jim the Fish?'
- Have we done Jim the Fish yet?!"
- ! '"Who''s Jim the Fish?"'
- ! '"I don''t understand," Amy shook her head.'
- ! '"Yeah, you do," Rory told her, gently.'
- ! '"I don''t," the Doctor shot back.'
- ! '"What are we all doing here?"'
- ! '"We''ve been recruited," Olivia finally spoke up, finally letting go of the Doctor
  but not stepping away from him as he looked down at her.'
- ! '"Something to do with space, 1969 and Canton Everett Delaware III."'
- ! '"Recruited by who?"'
- ! '"Who, Liv?"'
- ! '"Someone who trusts you more than anybody else in the universe," River replied
  for her, making her look away from the Doctor as he looked to River.'
- ! '"And who''s that?"'
- ! '"Spoilers."'
- ! '"1969, that''s an easy one!"'
- ! '"Funny how some years are easy.'
- That was his name, yeah?"
- ! '"How many of those can there be?'
- Well…three, I suppose," the Doctor finished before noticing River head after Amy,
  Olivia and Rory remaining with the Doctor.
- ! '"Rory," he asked, glancing to Olivia before asking, "Is everybody cross with
  me for some reason?"'
- ! '"I''ll find out," Rory replied, heading after Amy and River.'
- ! '"Liv?"'
- ! '"You alright?'
- You've been very quiet."
- ! '"Yeah," she nodded with a weak smile.'
- ! '"I just…have a lot of things on my mind."'
- ! '"What things?"'
- ! '"Just…things," she shrugged evasively.'
- ! '"Stuff I don''t really wanna talk about right now, Theta."'
- ! '"You''re hiding something from me, Olivia.'
- Why?"
- ! '"I can''t tell you."'
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Because…I just can''t, ok?'
- I haven't lied to you about anything so just drop it, please?"
- The Doctor heard the tremor in her voice as she lowered her gaze to their feet and
  sighed, wrapping his arms around her to hold her close and sigh, "Alright, Liv.
- I'm just used to you telling me everything."
- ! '"I know," she whispered.'
- ! '"I don''t know what''s going on with you four but I''m gonna find out soon,"
  he promised, making her roll her eyes before he lowered his arms from around her
  and marched toward the end of the platform to look at the people under it.'
- ! '"I''m being extremely clever up here, and there''s no one to stand around looking
  impressed!'
- What's the point in having you all?!"
- ! '"Hey!"'
- ! '"I''m up here, ya know?"'
- ! '"That''s not what I meant," he smiled, sailing up next to her.'
- ! '"You''ve seen all my tricks."'
- ! '"I sincerely doubt that, dear," she retorted with a smirk before she noticed
  the three from below come up the stairs.'
- ! '"Everybody on the same page?"'
- ! '"Very nearly," River replied.'
- ! '"Amy''s having a hard time with it."'
- ! '"That doesn''t surprise me," Olivia admitted, flipping a switch when it lit up
  and making it go dark again.'
- ! '"You''re dealing with it surprisingly well," River confessed.'
- ! '"So are you."'
- ! '"Yes, but I''m me, darling."'
- ! '"And I''m me.'
- I have to trust that Doctor knows what he's doing, both future and present."
- Olivia looked to River when she didn't respond to see her smirking back at her,
  making her frown as she asked, "What?"
- ! '"You never cease to amaze me, Mrs.'
- Sigma," River smirked, knowingly.
- Olivia scoffed before turning back to the console, replying, "Am I that volatile
  in the future, Doctor Song?"
- ! '"Spoilers."'
- ! '"Time isn''t in a straight line," the Doctor began his explanation, pulling a
  lever on the console.'
- ! '"It''s all bumpy-wumpy.'
- There's loads of boring stuff, like Sundays and Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons."
- He sneered as he grabbed a couple of levers and flipped them from their original
  positions before smiling, "But, now and then, there are Saturdays…big, temporal
  tipping points when anything's possible.
- The TARDIS can't resist them, like a moth to a flame."
- He stopped between Olivia and River glancing between them adoringly as he continued,
  "She loves a party, so I give her 1969 and NASA, because that's space in the 60s,
  and Canton Everett Delaware III…" He sailed toward another part of the console where
  the computer hung above it, resuming, "…and this is where she's pointing…"
- ! '"Washington D.C.'
- April 8th 1969," Amy read aloud then asked, "So why haven't we landed?"
- ! '"Because that''s not where we''re going," the Doctor replied, making them frown
  at him.'
- ! '"Oh," Rory chirped.'
- ! '"Where are we going?"'
- ! '"Home!"'
- ! '"Well you two are.'
- Knitting or biplanes…one or the other."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"A mysterious summons…you think I''m just going to go?'
- Who sent those messages?"
- ! '"I know you know.'
- Don't ever, ever think you're capable of that."
- ! '"You''re going to have to trust us this time," River explained, making the Doctor
  look up at her.'
- ! '"Trust you?'
- Sure," he retorted, standing and stepping toward her.
- ! '"But, first of all, Doctor Song, just one thing…who are you?"'
- River only stared at him as he continued, "You're someone from my future, guessing
  that, but who?"
- ! '"Ok," the Doctor tried.'
- ! '"Why are you in prison?'
- Seriously?"
- ! '"Trust us," Amy called, pulling Olivia closer to her and making Olivia look to
  her with wide eyes before looking to the Doctor and River.'
- ! '"Ok," he said, looking to them and Olivia felt her heart sink at the look on
  River''s face as he walked away, knowing she was hurt.'
- ! '"You have to do this and you can''t ask why," Amy told him, making him frown
  between the two of them.'
- ! '"Are you being threatened?"'
- ! '"Is someone making you say that?"'
- ! '"No," Amy replied.'
- ! '"You''re lying," he shot back.'
- ! '"She''s not lying," Olivia assured him, making his eyes meet hers and he could
  see it in her eyes before he glanced between them.'
- ! '"Swear to me," he ordered them.'
- ! '"Swear to me on something that matters."'
- Amy stared at him for a moment before giving a small smile and saying, "Fish fingers
  and custard."
- The Doctor gave a smile before looking to Olivia and she whispered, "Gravity."
- His eyes warmed as he glanced between them and smiled, "My life in your hands, girls."
- ! '"So!"'
- ! '"Canton Everett Delaware III.'
- Who's he?"
- ! '"Ex-FBI," Olivia read.'
- ! '"Looks like he got kicked out."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Problems with authority," she replied, then smirked, "I like him already."'
- ! '"Six weeks after he left the bureau the president contacted him for a private
  meeting," River read aloud.'
- ! '"1969.'
- Who's president?"
- ! '"Nixon," Olivia couldn''t help but scoff as River typed on the console focused
  on the computer.'
- ! '"Richard Milhous Nixon," River read.'
- ! '"Vietnam, Watergate.'
- There's some good stuff, too."
- ! '"Not enough," the Doctor argued.'
- ! '"Hippie!"'
- ! '"Archeologist."'
- ! '"Ok, since I don''t know what I''m getting into this time, for once, I''m being
  discreet…putting the engines on silent," the Doctor grinned, flipping a lever and
  making a sound, similar to feedback sound through the room.'
- Olivia placed a hand over her ear as she flipped the lever back, making the sound
  stop then pushed it farther down to really put the engines on silent and making
  the Doctor come back to look at her, asking, "Did you do something?"
- ! '"Nope," she chirped, River smirking at her.'
- ! '"Just watching you, love."'
- ! '"Putting the outer shell on invisible," he announced, running around the console
  again.'
- ! '"I haven''t done this in a while.'
- Big drain on the power."
- ! '"You can turn the TARDIS invisible?"'
- ! '"Very nearly," River replied, flipping the switches back and making the lights
  go back down.'
- ! '"Did you touch something?"'
- ! '"Just admiring your skills, sweetie," River replied, shaking her head.'
- ! '"Good," he replied, turning back to working the TARDIS.'
- ! '"You might learn something."'
- ! '"Oh, I''m certainly learning," Olivia smirked back at River when their gazes
  met as the Doctor tried to work the scanner.'
- ! '"The scanner doesn''t work when we''re cloaked," he complained before running
  toward the door.'
- He stopped, hearing the four heading after him and turning to say, "Whoa!
- Let's take it slow."
- Olivia rolled her eyes as they watched him head out the door, muttering, "Nothing's
  ever slow with him."
- ! '"Tell me about it," River muttered, making Olivia stare ahead with a wide-eyed,
  blank expression, instantly getting her hidden meaning.'
- ! '"I''m…not sure I wanted to hear that."'
- ! '"Trust me, you did," River replied, making Olivia frown at her, still wide-eyed.'
- A moment later the room shook, making Olivia grab the console as they all stumbled
  and River shook her head, sighing, "Every time."
- ! '"Don''t worry!"'
- ! '"Always does that when it''s cloaked!"'
- River dragged the scanner closer to the side of the console facing the door, making
  Rory remind her, "He said the scanner wouldn't work."
- ! '"I know.'
- Bless," she grinned, taking a huge wire from the console and hooking it up to the
  scanner, sending sparks flying.
- ! '"River, have you got my scanner working yet?!"'
- ! '"Oh, I hate him," she muttered.'
- ! '"No, you don''t!"'
- ! '"River!'
- Make her blue again!"
- ! '"Mr.'
- President," he called from the president's desk, the agents in the room aiming their
  guns at him.
- ! '"That child just told you everything you need to know, but you weren''t listening.'
- Do you think you can just shoot me?"
- ! '"Oh, that idiot!"'
- Olivia snapped as they all ran toward the door and she shouted, "They're Americans!"
- All guns trained on the four that tumbled out of the TARDIS, making them raise their
  hands in surrender as the Doctor did the same, calling, "Don't shoot.
- Definitely no shooting."
- ! '"Nobody shoots us either!"'
- ! '"Very much not in need of getting shot!'
- Look, we've got our hands up."
- ! '"Who the hell are you?"'
- ! '"Sir," the man they''d identified as Canton Everett Delaware III warned.'
- ! '"You need to stay back."'
- ! '"But who are they and what is that box?"'
- ! '"It''s a Police Box.'
- Can't you read?!"
- ! '"Darling, you''re being rude again," Olivia called.'
- ! '"I''m your new undercover agent, on loan from Scotland Yard.'
- Robinson."
- ! '"I hate you," River ground out.'
- ! '"No you don''t," the Doctor smirked.'
- ! '"Also my American Liaison, codename: Mrs.'
- Sigma."
- ! '"Hi," Olivia called with a tight smile and a small wave of her hand.'
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"Nah, boring question," the Doctor refused.'
- ! '"Who''s phoning you?'
- Because Canton III is right, that was definitely a girl's voice, which means there's
  only one place in America she can be phoning from."
- ! '"Where?"'
- ! '"Do not engage with the intruder, Mr.'
- Delaware," one of the agents warned.
- ! '"You heard everything I heard," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"It''s simple enough.'
- I'll explain."
- He sat down and propped his feet up on the desk, saying, "On the other hand, lay
  a finger on me, or my friends, and you'll never, ever know."
- ! '"How''d you get it in here?"'
- ! '"I mean, you didn''t carry it in."'
- ! '"Clever, eh?"'
- ! '"Love it."'
- ! '"Do not compliment the intruder!"'
- ! '"Five minutes?"'
- ! '"Five," he confirmed.'
- ! '"Mr.'
- President," the agent began.
- ! '"That man is a clear and present danger to—!"'
- ! '"Mr.'
- President," Canton interrupted.
- ! '"That man walked in here with a big blue box and four of his friends.'
- I say we give him five minutes, see if he delivers."
- ! '"Thanks Canton," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"If he doesn''t, I''ll shoot him myself," Canton added.'
- ! '"Not so thanks," the Doctor added as well.'
- ! '"Oh, I like this guy," Olivia smirked.'
- ! '"Sir I cannot recommend—!"'
- ! '"Shut up, Peterson!"'
- Nixon snapped at the agent before sighing, "Alright."
- ! '"Five minutes," Canton told the Doctor again, and everyone lowered their guns
  as the Doctor lowered his feet and sat properly at the desk.'
- ! '"I''m going to need a SWAT team ready to mobilize, street level maps covering
  all of Florida, a pot of coffee, twelve Jammie Dodgers and a fez."'
- ! '"Get him his maps," Canton ordered and the Doctor deflated, making Olivia pout
  cutely for him before the agents in the room began locking down the room and getting
  his maps for him as she strolled up next to him.'
- ! '"Want me to get you some Jammie Dodgers from the TARDIS kitchen?"'
- ! '"We have some?"'
- ! '"I stocked up on our honeymoon," she smiled back before heading back to the TARDIS,
  waving off one of the agents that asked where she was going as River, Amy and Rory
  stepped toward him.'
- ! '"She''s being awful nice to me," he grinned goofily at River, making her roll
  her eyes and shake her head before one of the agents came in with a stack of maps.'
- ! '"Why Florida?"'
- ! '"That''s where NASA is," the Doctor replied, still looking over the maps.'
- ! '"She mentioned a spaceman.'
- Also…there's another lead I'm following."
- ! '"A spaceman," Amy whispered to them.'
- ! '"Like the one we saw at the lake?"'
- ! '"Maybe," River replied warily, watching the Doctor carefully and making Olivia
  frown at her but she still said nothing.'
- ! '"Probably."'
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"I remember," Amy murmured, making Olivia''s frown deepen before Rory stepped
  in front of his wife.'
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"What do you remember?"'
- ! '"I don''t know, I just—" Amy cut herself off with a sharp intake of breath when
  she suddenly felt sick, gripping her stomach.'
- ! '"Amy, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"Yeah, no, I''m fine," Amy sputtered.'
- ! '"I''m just feeling a little sick."'
- ! '"Come on," Olivia murmured, taking her arm gently and leading her toward the
  door and the agents standing in front of it.'
- ! '"Gentlemen, can one of you show us to the restroom?"'
- ! '"Sorry, ma''am, while this procedure''s ongoing you must remain within the Oval
  Office," Peterson replied.'
- ! '"Shut up and take ''em to the restroom," Canton ordered, making Peterson glare
  at him before nodding to the agent beside him to lead Amy and Olivia to the bathroom.'
- ! '"This way, ladies," the agent entreated.'
- ! '"Thank you, sir," Olivia nodded as Amy went ahead of her and Olivia called in
  a singsong voice, "Thank you, Canton."'
- ! '"I''ll take care of her, Rory," Olivia assured him with a thumbs up and Rory
  nodded before she hurried after Amy and the agent.'
- When he showed them to the door they both stepped toward it but Amy stopped the
  agent when he was about to follow them in, saying, "Actually, I can usually manage
  this alone."
- ! '"I saw you before," Amy said, making Olivia frown but she didn''t take her eyes
  off the thing with a huge head and no mouth, its eyes beady and sunken in, two small
  holes for a nose.'
- ! '"At the lake.'
- How did I forget?"
- ! '"What are you?"'
- ! '"Get back!"'
- ! '"Get back from it!"'
- ! '"Oh, my god!"'
- ! '"What is that?'
- Ben, is that you?"
- ! '"Get away from it!"'
- ! '"Away from what, honey?"'
- ! '"That," Amy replied, nodding at the thing still staring at them.'
- The blonde turned again, gasping and laughing as she had when she saw it before,
  saying again, "Oh, my god!
- Did I just say all that?"
- ! '"No, please, you''ve gotta stay back!"'
- ! '"Back, honey?"'
- ! '"Back from what?"'
- The lights suddenly flickered and continued flickering as the woman explained, "Oh
  those lights.
- They never fix them."
- ! '"Look behind you," Amy told her and Olivia stared huge eyes at the alien as it
  lifted a huge three fingered hand toward her.'
- ! '"Honey, there is nothing…" she trailed off as she turned just as the electricity
  from the lights surged into the alien then out of its huge middle finger and into
  the blonde woman.'
- ! '"She couldn''t even remember you," Olivia ground out.'
- ! '"Why''d you kill her?"'
- ! '"How does that work?"'
- ! '"We can only remember you while we''re seeing you, is that it?"'
- ! '"Why did you have to kill her?"'
- ! '"Joy," a deep rattling voice came from the thing.'
- ! '"Her name was Joy.'
- Your names are Amelia and Olivia."
- ! '"Kinda rude to know who we are and not tell us who you are," Olivia growled.'
- ! '"You will tell the Doctor," the alien replied, taking slow steps toward them.'
- ! '"Tell him what?"'
- ! '"Amy, don''t talk to it anymore," Olivia ordered, gently, not taking her eyes
  off the thing.'
- ! '"What he must know and what he must never know," it answered Amy''s question,
  making both women stare wide eyes at it in disbelief and horror.'
- ! '"How do you know about that?"'
- ! '"We can''t," Olivia argued in a breath.'
- ! '"Tell him," it ordered and Amy bolted out the door.'
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"Are you ok?"'
- ! '"I''m fine," Amy smiled.'
- ! '"Much better, thanks."'
- ! '"What''s that?"'
- ! '"It''s my phone," Amy replied, looking at it, wondering why she''d pulled it
  out.'
- ! '"Your phone?"'
- ! '"Amy, this is 1969.'
- They don't have phones like that," Olivia muttered into Amy's ear, tucking her Sonic
  away as she realized it was in her hand, wondering why she'd pulled it out before
  looking to the agent with a fake grin.
- ! '"Nothing to worry about, sir.'
- Trust me."
- ! '"I have to tell the Doctor," Amy blurted, matter-of-factly.'
- ! '"Tell him what, ma''am?"'
- ! '"Sorry, I don''t know why I said that," she admitted.'
- ! '"Maybe we should just head back," Olivia suggested.'
- ! '"This way, ladies," the agent entreated and Olivia looped her arm around Amy''s
  as she tucked her phone away, both heading down the hall back toward the Oval Office.'
- ! '"The kid?"'
- ! '"Should I answer it?"'
- ! '"Here!"'
- ! '"The only place in the United States that call could be coming from.'
- Obvious, when you think about it."
- ! '"You, sir, are a genius," Canton complimented.'
- ! '"It''s a hobby," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"You don''t know the half of it," Olivia smirked, giving a wink to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Mr.'
- President, answer the phone," Canton permitted, and everyone watched as Nixon lifted
  the receiver, turning on the recorder to tape the phone call.
- ! '"Hello?"'
- ! '"This is President Nixon."'
- ! '"It''s here!"'
- ! '"The spaceman''s here!'
- It's gonna eat me!"
- ! '"There''s no time for a SWAT team," the Doctor said, snapping his fingers before
  grabbing his jacket and pulling it back on.'
- ! '"Let''s go.'
- Canton, on no account follow me into this box."
- Amy, Rory and River ran into the TARDIS with the Doctor right behind them and Olivia
  stopped just inside the threshold and smile at Canton, "Close the door behind you,
  if you please, Mr.
- Delaware?"
- ! '"What the hell are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Jefferson isn''t a girl''s name," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"It''s not her name either, but ''Jefferson…Adams…Hamilton.'''
- Olivia?"
- ! '"Surnames of the three founding fathers," she grinned at him.'
- ! '"Lovely fellas," he smiled back, stepping next to her.'
- ! '"Two of them fancied me."'
- ! '"God, there''s an image I didn''t need," Olivia muttered as the Doctor turned
  to operate the console again and she looked to River to add, "Second one today."'
- ! '"You see, the president asked the child two questions: ''Where are you?'''
- Now, where would you find three big, historical names in a row like that?"
- ! '"Where?"'
- ! '"Here," he replied, slamming a lever into place before running toward the door.'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"It''s uh…" he trailed off and the Doctor looked to Rory.'
- ! '"Are you taking care of this?"'
- ! '"Why is it always my turn?"'
- ! '"Because you''re the newest," Amy replied, leaving a sweet kiss to his cheek
  before running after the four.'
- ! '"Where are we?"'
- ! '"About five miles from Cape Kennedy Space Center," the Doctor replied, waving
  the flag in her face playfully and making her giggle.'
- ! '"It''s 1969, the Year of the Moon.'
- Interesting, don't you think?"
- ! '"But why would a little girl be here?"'
- ! '"I don''t know.'
- Lost me a bit," the Doctor admitted, heading for the window as River examined the
  phone on the desk.
- ! '"The President asked the girl where she was and she did what any lost little
  girl would do…she looked out of the window."'
- ! '"Streets," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Street names.'
- Of course!"
- ! '"The only place in Florida—probably all of America—with those three street names
  on the same junction," the Doctor added, glancing to River as she stood nearby.'
- ! '"And, Doctor Song, you''ve got that face on again."'
- ! '"What face?"'
- ! '"The ''He''s hot when he''s clever'' face," he replied.'
- ! '"This is my normal face," River argued.'
- ! '"Yes, it is," he smirked.'
- ! '"Oh, shut up," River smirked back, resuming scanning the room.'
- ! '"Not a chance," the Doctor shot back.'
- ! '"God, now I have to deal with the flirting," Olivia muttered, making the Doctor
  frown at her as she stepped away from him.'
- ! '"What''d you say?"'
- ! '"Nothing," she called back in a singsong tone just as she passed Canton when
  he stumbled out of the TARDIS.'
- ! '"We''ve moved," he observed as Rory stepped out after him.'
- ! '"How…How can we…have moved?"'
- ! '"You haven''t even got to space travel yet?"'
- ! '"I was going to cover it with time travel," Rory shot back.'
- ! '"Time travel?"'
- ! '"Braveheart Canton…come on," the Doctor called, heading after the girls.'
- ! '"So we''re in a box that''s bigger on the inside, and it travels through time
  and space?"'
- ! '"Yeah, basically," Rory nodded.'
- ! '"How long has Scotland yard had this?"'
- ! '"It''s a warehouse of some kind," River explained as she led them into the huge
  dark room.'
- ! '"Disused."'
- ! '"You realize this is almost certainly a trap, of course?"'
- ! '"I noticed the phone, yes," River replied.'
- ! '"What about the phone?"'
- ! '"What did I miss?"'
- ! '"It was cut off," River explained.'
- ! '"So how did the child phone from here?"'
- ! '"Ok, but why would anyone want to trap us?"'
- ! '"Don''t know," the Doctor admitted.'
- ! '"Let''s see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards."'
- ! '"Oh, yes, because that always works out so well for the rest of us," Olivia shot
  back as the group made their way deeper into the warehouse before coming to unboxed
  equipment and Olivia wondered, "Why would a little girl be here, of all places?"'
- ! '"I dunno," the Doctor admitted slinging an arm over her shoulders.'
- ! '"Let''s find her and ask her."'
- ! '"What''s that?"'
- ! '"It looks…seriously creepy."'
- ! '"It''s nonterrestrial," River reported.'
- ! '"Definitely alien.'
- Probably not even from this time zone."
- ! '"Which is odd, because look at this!"'
- ! '"It''s Earth tech, contemporary," River noted.'
- ! '"Very contemporary," the Doctor added, examining an astronaut helmet.'
- ! '"Cutting-edge.'
- This is from the Space Program!"
- ! '"Stolen?"'
- ! '"What, by aliens?"'
- ! '"Apparently," the Doctor replied, pulling the helmet over his head.'
- ! '"But why?"'
- ! '"I mean, if you can make it all the way to Earth why steal technology that can
  barely make it to the moon?"'
- ! '"Maybe ''cause it''s cooler!"'
- ! '"Look how cool this stuff is!"'
- ! '"Cool aliens?"'
- ! '"Well, what would you call me?"'
- ! '"An alien," Amy retorted as he pulled the helmet off.'
- ! '"Oi!"'
- ! '"I think he''s ok now," Rory called as he and Canton stood a few feet away, pointing
  flashlights at the thing in the center of the room.'
- ! '"Ah!'
- Back with us, Canton?"
- ! '"I like your wheels," Canton told him.'
- ! '"That''s my boy," the Doctor smiled back, patting his arm as he passed to search
  the rest of the warehouse.'
- ! '"Come on.'
- Little girl, let's find her."
- ! '"River…" Amy began, but didn''t have a chance to finish.'
- ! '"I know what you''re thinking," River cut in, scanning one of the wires stuck
  to the slab with some kind of slime.'
- ! '"So do I," Olivia added, using the Sonic on the slab itself.'
- ! '"No, you don''t," Amy argued to the both of them.'
- ! '"You''re thinking, ''If we can find the spaceman in 1969 and neutralize it then
  it won''t be around in 2011 to kill the Doctor''."'
- ! '"Ok, lucky guess," Amy conceded.'
- ! '"It''s because we were thinking it, too," Olivia told her, drawing Amy''s gaze
  to her as Olivia scanned the Sonic up the thick wire in front of her.'
- ! '"So let''s do it," Amy insisted.'
- ! '"It doesn''t work like that," River argued stepping around Amy.'
- ! '"The only reason we''re here is because of what we saw in the future," Olivia
  explained.'
- ! '"If we try preventing it from happening we''ll create a paradox."'
- ! '"Time can be rewritten," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Not all of it," River replied.'
- ! '"Says who?"'
- ! '"Who do you think, Amy?"'
- ! '"What''s this?"'
- ! '"Doctor, look at this."'
- ! '"So, where does that go?"'
- ! '"There''s a network of tunnels running under here," she reported.'
- ! '"Life signs?"'
- ! '"No," she hummed.'
- ! '"Nothing that''s showing up."'
- ! '"Those are the worst kind," he retorted as River began climbing into the hole
  and he ordered, "Be careful!"'
- ! '"Careful?"'
- ! '"Tried that once.'
- Ever so dull."
- ! '"Tell me about it," Olivia smirked in agreement.'
- ! '"Shout if you get in trouble," the Doctor told her.'
- ! '"Don''t worry, I''m quite the screamer," River smiled, broadly, making Olivia
  slap a hand to her face, hard.'
- ! '"Now there''s a spoiler for you."'
- ! '"Will I ever get a break from the images?"'
- ! '"Seriously?!"'
- ! '"So, what''s going on here?"'
- ! '"Uh…nothing," he chirped.'
- ! '"She''s just a friend."'
- Olivia shook her head with a smirk as Rory stepped up next to him to whisper, "I
  think he's talking about the possible Alien Incursion."
- ! '"Ok!"'
- ! '"Serious?"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"''She''s just a friend''?"'
- ! '"I know, shut up," he shot back, making her giggle before she knelt next to him,
  a thought suddenly striking her.'
- ! '"Theta," she whispered.'
- ! '"I have to tell you something."'
- ! '"Tell me," he replied, not looking away from what he was examining as she sighed.'
- ! '"That''s the thing," she began.'
- ! '"There''s something I have to tell you, but I can''t.'
- Like it's locked away or…I can't remember."
- ! '"Can''t remember?"'
- ! '"You…Olivia Lydia Felton…can''t remember?"'
- ! '"I knew something was wrong," she shuddered.'
- ! '"I never forget anything, do I?'
- Theta, something's wrong."
- ! '"All clear," River called, drawing everyone''s attention to her as she leaned
  out of the manhole.'
- ! '"Just tunnels.'
- I want to take another look around."
- ! '"Stupidly dangerous," the Doctor called as he and Olivia stood in their places.'
- ! '"Yep!'
- I like it, too," River called back, beginning her second descent.
- ! '"Amy, Olivia…look after him."'
- ! '"Rory, would you mind going with her?"'
- ! '"Yeah, a bit," Rory retorted.'
- ! '"Then I''d appreciate it all the more," the Doctor replied as Olivia patted Rory''s
  back.'
- ! '"Hang on, River," Rory called, heading toward the manhole as the Doctor turned
  to Olivia.'
- ! '"I''m coming, too."'
- ! '"Did River seem a bit out of breath to you?"'
- ! '"Never mind that, look at me," the Doctor ordered gently, lifting his hands toward
  her face and making her frown at him.'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"I''m gonna see what''s going on in that brain of yours, something I''ve been
  trying to do for a very long time now," he replied, closing his eyes and she felt
  his presence in her mind.'
- ! '"We don''t have time for this," she told him.'
- ! '"We have to find that little girl."'
- ! '"There''s always time for my girl, now hush and give us a mo," he shot back.'
- ! '"Something''s been…erased," he murmured, making her frown.'
- ! '"Erased?"'
- ! '"A snippet of your memory''s been wiped clean, like…nothing happened," he explained,
  and she felt his presence leave her mind as he lowered his hands and looked into
  her eyes.'
- ! '"What did that to you?"'
- ! '"I know you''re not really asking me, but I don''t know," she answered before
  asking, "Do you want me to go with River and Rory?"'
- ! '"No," the Doctor instantly replied, placing his hands on her shoulders.'
- ! '"Stay here, where I can keep an eye on you."'
- ! '"You let her do what she wants," she muttered as he turned to begin examining
  things again.'
- ! '"That''s because she can fight for herself."'
- ! '"So can I!"'
- ! '"Not like she can, and I feel better when you''re close by, got it?"'
- ! '"Can I ask you something?"'
- ! '"Of course," he replied, moving on to the next thing.'
- ! '"You and River," she began in a whisper, glancing to Canton and Amy.'
- ! '"I know…you''ve seen her die, but does that mean your timelines are back-to-front?'
- Like, ships passing each other?"
- He didn't look at her for a moment before finally answering, "Yes.
- Eventually, I'm sure we'll meet her, and she won't know me the way she does now."
- Olivia let that sink in before breathing, "God, I can't imagine how she must've
  felt when you met her that first time…for you."
- The Doctor looked to her with a frown before she continued, "The one you love not
  knowing who you are—If that'd been me…I'd have wanted to kill myself."
- He looked away from her and back to the table, lost in thought and muttered, "She
  did."
- ! '"Theta—?"'
- ! '"Go help Canton and Amy," he told her, turning a weak smile to her before adding,
  "Please."'
- ! '"So, you were kicked out of the FBI because you had attitude problems," Amy questioned
  Canton as Olivia approached.'
- ! '"I heard it was issues with authority," Olivia smirked, leaning next to him.'
- ! '"No," he smirked back, slightly.'
- ! '"I just wanted to get married."'
- ! '"Is that a crime?"'
- ! '"Yes," he replied before looking to Olivia, asking, "Doctor who, exactly?"'
- ! '"Mm, that''s classified, Agent Delaware," Olivia smiled back.'
- ! '"Classified by who?"'
- ! '"God knows," Amy muttered.'
- ! '"Do you two work for him?"'
- ! '"I''m his wife," Olivia replied, using her Sonic on the machine again.'
- ! '"He''s my friend," Amy replied.'
- ! '"If ''friend'' is the right word.'
- I had something I wanted to tell him, but stuff always gets in the way."
- ! '"Stuff does that," Canton replied as Olivia frowned at Amy in wonder.'
- ! '"Help me!"'
- ! '"Help!'
- Help me!"
- ! '"That''s her," Canton said, as Olivia ran toward the Doctor, Amy right after
  her.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"Amy?'
- You ok?"
- ! '"Canton!"'
- ! '"Canton!'
- Are you ok?"
- ! '"Is he alright?"'
- ! '"Just unconscious," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Got a proper whack."'
- ! '"Doctor," Amy shuddered, holding her stomach as Olivia glanced between the three.'
- ! '"I need to tell you something.'
- I have to tell you it now."
- ! '"Not a very good time, Amy," Olivia told her, making Amy grab her arm and stare
  into her jade eyes.'
- ! '"It''s important," Amy insisted.'
- ! '"It has to be now!"'
- ! '"Help!"'
- ! '"Help me!"'
- ! '"Doctor…I''m pregnant."'
- ! '"That''s it," Amy shuddered.'
- ! '"The astronaut."'
- ! '"Help me!"'
- ! '"Get down!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Saving your life!"'
- ! '"Amy, no!"'
- ! '"13,594," she breathed before swallowing and uncapping the pen, pulling the sleeve
  of her leather jacket up and making a mark on her arm amongst the tons of marks
  she''d made on her arms, face, neck and chest.'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Bondage?"'
- ! '"Buy me dinner first, big boy."'
- Canton smirked, grabbing her wrist and spinning her around to put the cuffs on her,
  replying, "I'll buy your last meal.
- How 'bout that?"
- ! '"How romantic," she spat, trying to pull out of his grip as the agents drew their
  guns and aimed them at her.'
- ! '"Where are my friends?!"'
- ! '"You can visit ''em later," he assured her, pushing her toward the car across
  the street.'
- ! '"They''re on their way in a thing we like to call ''stasis''."'
- ! '"Where''s the Doctor?"'
- ! '"I swear, if you''ve hurt him—!"'
- ! '"We''re on our way to see him now, Miss Felton," Canton replied.'
- ! '"Rest assured, you''ll see him one last time."'
- ! '"Zero-balance dwarf-star alloy," she murmured as Canton led her toward the box.'
- ! '"Won''t be enough."'
- ! '"Funny," he smirked.'
- ! '"That''s what he said."'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Liv," he smiled, warmly.'
- ! '"I''m here, my love," she whispered, pressing her forehead to his and closing
  her eyes as tears rolled down her cheeks.'
- ! '"I''m here."'
- ! '"Aw, how sweet," Canton mocked from behind Olivia.'
- ! '"Is there a reason you''re doing this?"'
- ! '"I want you to know where you stand," Canton replied as the men bringing in the
  bags left the cell and Canton slid his fingers into a panel on the wall that controlled
  the door and sealed it, making it disappear into the wall as he spoke.'
- ! '"In a cell.'
- So I guess they can't hear us, right?"
- ! '"Good work, Canton," the Doctor whispered.'
- ! '"Door sealed?"'
- ! '"You bet," Canton nodded.'
- ! '"Geez," Olivia groaned, pulling off her blue leather jacket to examine the spot
  on the back of it.'
- ! '"Those paintballs hurt!"'
- ! '"Stand up," the Doctor ordered her as Amy and Rory burst through the body bags
  and she frowned but shot to her feet.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Missed you," he whispered.'
- ! '"Missed you more," she whispered back, letting him go so they could both help
  Amy and Rory out of their body bags.'
- ! '"These things could really do with air holes!"'
- ! '"Never had a complaint before," Canton smirked as Olivia marched toward Canton
  to hold up her jacket in his face.'
- ! '"I''m sending you the bill," she reported, glaring comically at him.'
- ! '"Liv, the TARDIS can clean it fine," the Doctor strained, touching his toes.'
- ! '"Isn''t it gonna look odd that you''re staying in here with us?"'
- ! '"Odd, but not alarming," Canton replied as Olivia lowered her jacket to pout
  at it.'
- ! '"They know there''s no way out of this place."'
- ! '"Exactly, whatever they might think we''re doing in here, they know we''re not
  going anywhere," the Doctor replied, stepping to a corner and snapping his suspenders
  before leaning sideways, making an invisible image of the TARDIS resonate.'
- ! '"Shall we?"'
- ! '"What about Doctor Song?"'
- ! '"She dove off a rooftop."'
- ! '"Yeah, she does that," Olivia replied, running around the console as the Doctor
  shut the doors then shot toward the console.'
- ! '"Amy, Rory!"'
- ! '"Open all the doors to the swimming pool!"'
- ! '"Which rooftop?!"'
- ! '"New York," he told her as she and the Doctor operated the TARDIS console.'
- ! '"God!'
- I missed this thing!"
- ! '"And I missed you."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I''ve never kissed you with a beard before," she frowned.'
- ! '"Oh…and?"'
- ! '"I don''t like it."'
- ! '"Oh."'
- ! '"Best wash up," he advised her.'
- ! '"Give me your jacket and I''ll toss it into the TARDIS wash room."'
- ! '"So, we know they''re everywhere," he explained, running around the console.'
- ! '"Not just a landing party, an occupying force, and they''ve been here a very,
  very long time.'
- But nobody knows that because no one can remember them."
- ! '"So what are they up to?"'
- ! '"No idea," the Doctor replied, slapping a lever into place.'
- ! '"But the good news is…we''ve got a secret weapon."'
- ! '"Apollo 11 is your secret weapon?"'
- ! '"No, no, it''s not Apollo 11," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"That would be silly.'
- It's Neil Armstrong's foot."
- The Doctor injected something into Canton's hand, making him wince and call, "Ow!"
- ! '"So, three months," the Doctor called, the injector gun still in his hand.'
- ! '"What have we found out?"'
- ! '"Well, they are everywhere," Rory reported, as the Doctor took his hand to inject
  him.'
- ! '"Every state in America—ah!"'
- ! '"Not just America, the entire world!"'
- ! '"There''s a greater concentration here, though," River reported, looking at the
  screen above the console as the Doctor stopped in front of Amy and injected her
  hand, making her cry out in pain and frown at him.'
- ! '"You ok?"'
- ! '"All better," she nodded.'
- ! '"Better?"'
- ! '"Turns out I was wrong," Amy explained.'
- ! '"I''m…I''m not pregnant."'
- ! '"What''s up?"'
- ! '"Nothing," Amy lied then scoffed, "Really, nothing, seriously."'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"You start making surprise attacks like that I''m not holding your hand anymore!"'
- ! '"So you''ve seen them, but you don''t remember them?"'
- ! '"You''ve seen them, too," River reported.'
- ! '"That night at the warehouse, remember?'
- While you were pretending to hunt us down, we saw hundreds of those things."
- ! '"But, we still have no clue what they look like," Olivia reported.'
- ! '"It''s like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as you look away,"
  Rory explained.'
- ! '"The exact second you''re not looking at them, you can''t remember anything."'
- ! '"Sometimes you feel a bit sick though, but not always," Amy added.'
- ! '"So that''s why you marked your skin," Canton realized.'
- ! '"Only way we''d know we''d had an encounter," Amy confirmed.'
- ! '"How long have they been here?"'
- ! '"We''ve spent the past few months trying to find that out," Olivia reported,
  watching the Doctor as he watched Amy.'
- ! '"Yeah, not easy if you can''t remember anything you discover," Rory added.'
- ! '"How long do you think?"'
- ! '"As long as there''s been something in the corner of your eye or creaking in
  your house or breathing under your bed or voices through a wall," the Doctor replied,
  stepping toward Canton and River stepped around the console, closer to the Doctor.'
- ! '"They''ve been running your lives for a very long time now, so keep this straight
  in your head: We are not fighting an alien invasion.'
- And today the battle begins."
- ! '"How?"'
- ! '"Like this…" the Doctor replied before using the injector on River''s hand and
  making her shout and shake her hand to relieve the bite of pain as the Doctor laughed,
  holding something tiny in his other hand.'
- ! '"Nanorecorder.'
- Fuses with the cartilage in you hand."
- ! '"Here, darling, let me," Olivia smiled as he loaded the tiny thing into the gun
  and she took it from him to jab his hand with it, pulling the trigger.'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- he called before snatching the thing from her and resuming, "It tunes itself directly
  to the speech centers in your brain.
- So, the moment you see one of the creatures…" He lifted his hand to demonstrate,
  pressing the recorder so that a red light flashed in his palm.
- ! '"…you activate it and describe aloud exactly what you''re seeing."'
- ! '"Because the moment you break contact, you''re going to forget it happened.'
- If you've had an encounter that's the first you'll know about it."
- ! '"Why didn''t you tell me this before we started?"'
- ! '"I did," the Doctor replied heading to the console and doing something on it.'
- ! '"But even information about these creatures erases itself over time.'
- I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you."
- He instantly pressed the nanorecorder in his hand when he saw the creature, sputtering,
  "My god!
- How did it get in here?!"
- ! '"Keep eye contact with the creature and when I say, turn back, and when you do,
  straighten my bowtie," the Doctor instructed, and after a brief moment he said,
  "Alright, turn away."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"What are you staring at?"'
- ! '"Look at your hand," Olivia urged, making him frown as he looked to the red light
  flashing in his hand.'
- ! '"Why''s it doing that?"'
- ! '"What does it mean if the light''s flashing?"'
- ! '"What did I just tell you?"'
- ! '"I haven''t—"'
- ! '"Play it."'
- ! '"It''s a hologram," the Doctor assured them.'
- ! '"Extrapolated from the photo on Amy''s phone.'
- Take a good, long look."
- ! '"You just saw an image of one of the creatures we''re fighting," the Doctor reported.'
- ! '"Describe it to me."'
- ! '"I can''t," Canton replied when the Doctor looked to him.'
- ! '"No," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"Neither can I.'
- You straightened my bowtie because I planted the idea in your head while you were
  looking at the creature."
- ! '"So they could do that to people," Amy guessed as the Doctor marched around the
  console to work on his computer above it.'
- ! '"You could be doing stuff and not really knowing why you''re doing it."'
- ! '"Like posthypnotic suggestion," Rory added.'
- ! '"Ruling the world with posthypnotic suggestion," Olivia sighed, rubbing her face
  in anxiety.'
- ! '"Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"They got the suit from NASA, but where did they get the girl?"'
- ! '"Could be anywhere," Canton retorted.'
- ! '"No, they''d stay close to that warehouse," Olivia theorized.'
- ! '"Get her to the equipment as fast as possible.'
- They'd take her from somewhere that would draw the least amount of attention."
- ! '"But you''ll have to find her," the Doctor cut in, slinging an arm around Olivia''s
  shoulders.'
- ! '"We''re off to NASA."'
- ! '"Find her?"'
- ! '"Where do we look?"'
- ! '"Children''s homes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"We?"'
- ! '"Yes, we," he smiled down at her.'
- ! '"Quality time with my girl."'
- ! '"Hurry up, Theta," Olivia whispered, standing outside the hatch he was working
  in.'
- ! '"Somebody could come by any minute!"'
- ! '"Just keep your lookout, Liv," he told her, not faltering in his work.'
- ! '"You know, when you said I was coming along, I thought I''d be of some actual
  help," she shot back.'
- ! '"Not just a lookout."'
- ! '"You are helping!"'
- ! '"You''re keeping me company.'
- Quality time."
- ! '"Yeah, Amy," she greeted.'
- ! '"I think we''ve found the place she was taken from," Amy said.'
- ! '"How do you know?"'
- ! '"Because those things have been here," she explained as Olivia stepped to the
  edge of the hatch to watch him attach something to the wiring he was working under.'
- ! '"But the whole place is deserted.'
- There's just one guy here and I think he's lost it."
- ! '"Repeated memory wipes will do that to ya," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Find out what you can, but don''t stay there too long."'
- ! '"Where are you two?"'
- ! '"Uh, we gotta go," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"Got company."'
- ! '"Doctor…"'
- ! '"Don''t worry," he told the two men.'
- ! '"I put everything back the way I found it.'
- Except this."
- ! '"There''s always a bit left over, isn''t there?"'
- ! '"You are such an idiot," Olivia sighed.'
- ! '"Now, one more time, sir," one of the men urged.'
- ! '"How the hell did you two get into the command module?"'
- ! '"I told you," the Doctor drawled.'
- ! '"We''re on a top secret mission for the president.'
- She's my American Liaison."
- ! '"Well, maybe if you just get President Nixon to assure us of that, sir, that
  would be swell," the man in glasses chuckled as the Doctor lowered his cuffs.'
- ! '"Smart ass," Olivia muttered.'
- ! '"Behave, Liv," the Doctor murmured before looking to the men again, reporting,
  "I sent him a message."'
- ! '"Hello," Nixon greeted as the two men scrambled to their feet while Olivia and
  the Doctor only grinned from their seats.'
- The President held his hand toward the man in glasses, saying, "I believe it's Mr.
- Head of Security."
- ! '"Uh, yes, sir," Gardner sputtered, shaking his hand.'
- ! '"Yes, Mr.'
- President."
- ! '"Mr.'
- Grant, is it?"
- ! '"Yes, Mr.'
- President," Grant replied, shaking his hand.
- ! '"The hopes and dreams of millions of Americans stand here today at Cape Kennedy,"
  Nixon began.'
- ! '"And you''re the men who guard those dreams.'
- On behalf of the American people, I thank you."
- ! '"You''re welcome, Mr.'
- President," Gardner nodded.
- ! '"I understand you have a baby on the way, Mr.'
- Grant," Nixon smiled.
- ! '"Yes, Mr.'
- President," Grant grinned.
- ! '"What are you hoping for?"'
- ! '"A boy or a girl?"'
- ! '"Just a healthy American, Sir," Grant replied, making Nixon laugh as Olivia roll
  her eyes and sigh in boredom while the Doctor smirked at her.'
- ! '"A healthy American will do just nicely!"'
- ! '"Now, fellas, listen…these two, here…Codenames: The Doctor and Mrs.'
- Could you, uh, cut them a little slack?"
- ! '"Uh, Mr.'
- President, they did break into Apollo 11," Gardner informed him.
- ! '"Well," Nixon smirked.'
- ! '"I''m sure they had a very good reason for that.'
- Could you do that for me?"
- ! '"Well—"'
- ! '"Son," Nixon broke into Grant''s objection.'
- ! '"I am your Commander in Chief."'
- ! '"Then I guess that would be fine, Mr.'
- President," Gardner quickly conceded.
- ! '"Glad to hear it," Nixon nodded as the guard behind the two unhooked Olivia''s
  and the Doctor''s cuffs, letting them stand.'
- ! '"Thank you," the Doctor grinned, shaking their hands.'
- ! '"Bye-bye."'
- ! '"I don''t think I''ve ever heard the word ''American'' used so many times in
  a conversation," Olivia said, as she flipped a lever on the console, the Doctor
  running around it to fly before sailing up next to her.'
- ! '"You know he''s in the room, right?"'
- ! '"I don''t care," she muttered before she felt his presence in her mind as he
  used their link.'
- ! '"Look, I know he''s probably not your favorite president," he began.'
- ! '"He''s not mine either, but try not to make it so obvious."'
- ! '"You outta know me better than that by now, my love," she retorted, glancing
  his way and making him give an admonishing gaze, to which she pouted and blinked
  innocently.'
- ! '"Liv, can I speak to you in private, please?'
- River, take over, thank you," the Doctor said, heading around the console to grab
  Olivia's hand to pull her down the stairs that led underneath the console platform.
- Once beneath the console he stopped and turned her to face him, holding both her
  hands as he looked her in the eye as he said, "I don't know what's going on here,
  but something has gotten into you, and you're gonna tell me, right now, what it
  is."
- ! '"No, Olivia," he objected firmly, lifting a hand to her chin and gently pulling
  her gaze back to his, but she let her eyes settle on his bowtie.'
- ! '"Look at me."'
- ! '"Theta," she shuddered, closing her eyes, tightly and he noticed tears roll down
  her cheeks before she opened her eyes again and looked him squarely in the eye.'
- ! '"I can''t.'
- But I can't."
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Don''t you get it?!"'
- ! '"I''m trying to protect you!'
- For once…just once…let me do that for you!"
- ! '"Where''s Nixon?"'
- ! '"He went to loo," Rory replied, cautiously as River only glared at him.'
- ! '"I''ll…make sure he doesn''t get lost."'
- ! '"Stop glaring at me," he requested, not looking away from the console as he operated
  it.'
- ! '"Stop asking her what''s bothering her," she shot back, making him look up at
  her as he set his jaw.'
- ! '"What we discuss has nothing to do with you," he replied.'
- ! '"Like hell it doesn''t," she retorted, stepping toward him.'
- ! '"We all asked you to trust us with this, and you''re hurting her every time you
  ask her about it.'
- I'm warning you…stop it."
- ! '"Where are you going?"'
- ! '"To comfort your other wife," she shot back before she disappeared and he slammed
  a lever into place, angrily.'
- ! '"You have to tape everything that happens in this office," the Doctor told Nixon
  who was now sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, Olivia leaning sideways on the
  TARDIS as she watched them.'
- ! '"Every word or we won''t know you''re under the influence."'
- ! '"Doctor, you have to give me more than this," Nixon urged as the Doctor and Olivia
  were about to step into the TARDIS.'
- ! '"What were you doing to Apollo 11?"'
- ! '"Thing," the Doctor replied, vaguely.'
- ! '"Clever thing.'
- You have to trust me and nobody else."
- ! '"Doctor," River called, leaning out the door of the TARDIS with a phone in her
  hand.'
- ! '"It''s Canton.'
- Quick, he needs us."
- ! '"Ok!'
- I've got it!"
- The Doctor passed Canton and used the Sonic on the lock, calling, "Amy, we're here!
- Are you ok?!"
- ! '"I can''t see!"'
- ! '"Where is she, Doctor?"'
- ! '"It''s empty," she reported.'
- ! '"It''s dark," they heard Amy shudder, making them look around the room in wonder
  before they looked to the floor at the flashing red spot on the rug.'
- ! '"So dark.'
- Please, can anybody hear me?"
- ! '"They took this out of her," he breathed as he stood.'
- ! '"How did they do that, Doctor?'
- Why can I still hear her?"
- ! '"Is it a recording?"'
- ! '"It defaults to live," the Doctor replied, solemnly.'
- ! '"This is current.'
- Wherever she is right now, this is what she's saying."
- ! '"Amy, can you hear me?"'
- ! '"We''re coming for you.'
- Wherever you are, we're coming, I swear."
- ! '"She can''t hear you," the Doctor reported as they all heard Amy sobbing from
  the recorder over the rain outside, Rory turning to look at him.'
- ! '"I''m so sorry.'
- It's one way."
- ! '"She can always hear me, Doctor," Rory argued.'
- ! '"Always.'
- Always."
- ! '"Doctor," Amy whispered, making him look to it.'
- ! '"Are you out there?'
- Please, please, Doctor, just get me out of this."
- ! '"He''s coming," Rory assured her, even though he knew she couldn''t hear him.'
- ! '"I''ll bring him, I swear."'
- ! '"Hello?"'
- ! '"Is somebody there?'
- We…I can't…I can't remember."
- ! '"What happened to it?"'
- ! '"I shot it," Canton replied.'
- ! '"Good job," she nodded, patting his shoulder as no one took their eyes off of
  it.'
- The Doctor knelt in front of it as it backed away, wheezing and rattling oddly as
  he demanded, "Who and what are you?"
- ! '"Silence, Doctor," the thing hissed, making his eyes widened in recognition.'
- ! '"We are the Silence.'
- And Silence will fall."
- ! '"Oh, my god, Doctor," Olivia shuddered as everyone glanced between the three
  in wonder.'
- ! '"I know," he murmured, as she stepped toward him to grip his shoulder in fear.'
- ! '"What do we need to do?"'
- ! '"Do exactly as I say."'
- ! '"It''s an exoskeleton," River explained.'
- ! '"Basically life support.'
- There's about twenty different kinds of alien tech in here."
- ! '"Who was she?"'
- ! '"Why put her in here?"'
- ! '"You put this on, you don''t even need to eat," River observed.'
- ! '"The suit processes sunlight directly.'
- It's got built-in weaponry and a communications system that can hack into anything."
- ! '"Including the phone network?"'
- ! '"Easily," River nodded to her.'
- ! '"But why the president?"'
- ! '"It defaults to the highest authority it can find," River explained.'
- ! '"The little girl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone
  call."'
- ! '"Night Terrors with a hotline to the White House," Olivia added, watching the
  Doctor smell then lick the blue envelope his invitation came in.'
- ! '"You won''t learn anything from that, ya know?"'
- ! '"Purchased on Earth," he began, stepping closer to her with a cocky smirk.'
- ! '"Perfectly ordinary stationery, TARDIS blue.'
- How about you?"
- ! '"Oh, are you under the impression that I''m no longer angry with you?"'
- ! '"Take it to the curly haired blonde over there."'
- ! '"Olivia," River chided, gently as the Doctor turned to look at River.'
- ! '"I''m not having this discussion with him," Olivia announced, irritably as she
  stepped toward Rory and River looked to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Our lives are back to front," she told him.'
- ! '"Your future''s my past.'
- Your firsts are my lasts."
- ! '"That''s not really what I asked," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"Ask something else, then," River shot back.'
- ! '"What are the Silence doing, raising a child?"'
- ! '"Keeping her safe," River explained as Olivia marched toward the suit to examine
  it herself.'
- ! '"Even giving her independence."'
- ! '"The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are doing," the Doctor
  said, pacing near Rory.'
- ! '"I know," Rory replied.'
- ! '"And every single thing we learn about them brings us a step closer."'
- ! '"Yeah, Doctor, I get it."'
- ! '"It''s possible she''s not just any little girl," Olivia said, using her Sonic
  on he suit as she looked to River over it.'
- ! '"Well, I''d say she''s human, going by the life-support software," River said,
  using her handheld on its pieces.'
- ! '"But…" the Doctor prompted.'
- ! '"Looks like she climbed out of this," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"She forced her way out."'
- ! '"She must be incredibly strong," River added.'
- ! '"Incredibly strong and running away," the Doctor summarized, adding, "I like
  her."'
- ! '"We should be trying to find her," Olivia shot back.'
- ! '"Yes, I know, but how," he replied, looking to her as he stood an inch away from
  her.'
- She swallowed as she felt her heart skip when he gazed down at her and added, "Anyway,
  I have the strangest feeling she's going to find us."
- ! '"Theta—"'
- ! '"Later," he cut in, looking to the TV as they heard Apollo 11 being set up for
  launch.'
- ! '"Attention span of a gnat," she ground out, turning back to the suit.'
- ! '"I know," River nodded.'
- ! '"Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit?"'
- ! '"Because that''s what the Silence do," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Think about it…they don''t make anything themselves.'
- They get other life forms to do it for them."
- ! '"So they''re parasites, then," River guessed.'
- ! '"Superparasites," the Doctor confirmed stepping closer to them.'
- ! '"Standing in the shadows of human history since the very beginning.'
- If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands of years…"
- ! '"Then what?"'
- ! '"Why did we suddenly decide to go to the moon?"'
- Olivia replied in realization, making the Doctor look to her with a smile as she
  finished, "Because the Silence needed a spacesuit."
- ! '"This suit," she said, watching the hand twitch.'
- ! '"It seems to be repairing itself.'
- Doctor, a unit like this…would it ever be able to move without an occupant?"
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"The little girl said the spaceman was coming to eat her," Olivia recalled, stepping
  next to River who nodded to her.'
- ! '"Maybe that''s exactly what happened.'
- It 'ate' her."
- ! '"I love you," they heard Amy as Rory now sat against a crate a yard or so away.'
- ! '"I know you think it''s him, I know you think it ought to be him, but it''s not,
  it''s you and when I see you again, I''m gonna tell you properly, just to see your
  stupid face."'
- Olivia watched the Doctor head toward Rory as Amy continued, "My life was so boring
  before you just dropped out of the sky.
- So just get your stupid face where I can see it, ok?"
- ! '"You''re not angry?"'
- ! '"I know who she''s talking about," Olivia replied, not looking at her.'
- ! '"Me too," River smirked, knowingly.'
- ! '"Right!"'
- ! '"Time for my cunning plan!'
- Liv…" She looked to him with a frown when he trailed off before he smirked, "Well,
  sound the call."
- Realizing what he meant she couldn't help but grin, "Allons-y!"
- ! '"Where am I?"'
- ! '"Where is this?"'
- ! '"You are Amelia Pond," the Silent said, turning to her.'
- ! '"You''re ugly," she shot back.'
- ! '"Has anyone mentioned that to you?"'
- ! '"We do you honor," the Silent replied.'
- ! '"You will bring the Silence.'
- But your part will soon be over."
- ! '"Whatever that means," Amy retorted.'
- ! '"You''ve made a big mistake, bringing me here, ''cause wait till you see what''s
  coming for you now."'
- ! '"You have been here many days," it told her.'
- ! '"No, I just got here," she argued.'
- ! '"You just put me in here."'
- ! '"Your memory is weak," it argued back, stepping closer to her.'
- ! '"You have been here many days."'
- ! '"No, I can''t have been."'
- ! '"You will sleep now."'
- ! '"Oh, interesting," he said, looking around as he stepped out, followed by River
  and Olivia.'
- ! '"Very Aikman Road.'
- Oh, well I suppose I'm about to find out."
- ! '"Everyone, keep one Silent in eyeshot," Olivia ordered as River lifted her gun
  and Rory stepped from the TARDIS, shutting the door behind him.'
- ! '"Oh, hello!"'
- ! '"Sorry.'
- Just had to say, though, have you seen what's on telly?"
- ! '"Oh, hello, Amy," he called as they passed her and Olivia set the TV down on
  the console.'
- ! '"You alright?'
- You wanna watch that…me, when I'm confident."
- ! '"Set, Doctor," Olivia reported, pulling her Sonic from her jacket as she kept
  her eye on a Silent near her, River stepping up to the other side of the Doctor.'
- ! '"Thanks Liv," he grinned, quickly turning to give her a wink before turning forward
  again.'
- ! '"Oh, and this is my friend River.'
- Kind of do, a bit."
- ! '"Thank you, sweetie," River smiled, standing back to back with him.'
- ! '"I know you''re team players and everything," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"But she''ll definitely kill at least the first three of you."'
- ! '"Well, the first seven, easily," River retorted.'
- ! '"Seven, really?"'
- ! '"Eight for you, honey."'
- ! '"Stop it."'
- ! '"Make me."'
- ! '"Yeah?'
- Well maybe I will."
- ! '"Is this important flirting?"'
- ! '"Yeah, because I feel like I should be higher on the list right now!"'
- ! '"Yes, right, sorry!"'
- ! '"As I was saying: My naughty friend, here, is going to kill the first three of
  you to attack, plus him behind, so maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz.'
- You've been interfering in human history for thousands of years, yes, people have
  suffered and died, but what's the point in two hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving
  now and then?"
- ! '"Ooh, ''The Silence''," Olivia fake shivered, glancing around at them as the
  Doctor stepped back toward her and TV.'
- ! '"You guys take that seriously, don''t you?"'
- ! '"Ok, you''ve got me!"'
- ! '"I''m lying.'
- What's she for?"
- ! '"Sorry boys, but you''re way outta time now," Olivia warned the Silence.'
- ! '"Did I introduce my friend, Olivia?"'
- ! '"She''s clever too, and American, so this is very important to her.'
- You have the stage, darling."
- ! '"Thank you, dear," Olivia smiled before looking to the Silence as the Doctor
  lifted the antenna on the TV.'
- ! '"Bit of history for you.'
- Half a billion."
- ! '"And that''s nothing," the Doctor chimed in, leaning on the TV.'
- ! '"Because the human race will spread out among the stars.'
- You just watch them fly, billions and billions of them for billions and billions
  of years."
- ! '"And you know what?"'
- ! '"Every single one of them, at some point in their lives, will look back at this
  man taking that very first step and they''ll never, ever forget it."'
- ! '"But they''ll forget this bit," the Doctor added, pulling a phone from his jacket
  and speaking into it.'
- ! '"Ready?"'
- ! '"That''s one small step for man—"'
- ! '"You should kill us all on sight," the Silent on the screen said.'
- ! '"You''ve given the order for your own execution," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"And the whole planet just heard you."'
- ! '"…one giant leap for mankind," Neil Armstrong continued.'
- ! '"And one whacking great kick up the rear for the Silence!"'
- ! '"You just raised an army against yourself and now, for thousands of generations,
  you''re gonna order them to kill you every day."'
- ! '"How fast can you run?"'
- ! '"Because today''s the day the human race throw you off their planet.'
- I think, quite possibly, the word you're looking for right now is—oops."
- ! '"Run," Olivia called, seeing the electricity being drawn to the Silent.'
- ! '"Guys, I mean us!'
- Run!"
- ! '"Well, this is new!"'
- ! '"What is?!"'
- ! '"You dragging me around!"'
- ! '"Get inside!'
- Start her up!"
- ! '"Run!"'
- ! '"Into the TARDIS!'
- Quickly!"
- ! '"Where are they?!"'
- ! '"Out there!"'
- ! '"Take care of Amy, don''t touch the console yet!"'
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Hurry up!"
- ! '"Don''t let them build to full power!"'
- ! '"I know!'
- There's a reason why I'm shooting, honey!"
- ! '"Doctor!'
- What are you doing?!"
- ! '"Helping!"'
- ! '"You idiot!'
- Build a cabinet!"
- ! '"That''s really rude!"'
- ! '"Learn how to drive!"'
- ! '"Our old fella didn''t see that, did he?"'
- ! '"He gets ever so cross."'
- ! '"I''ll bet," Olivia smirked back when she turned to her.'
- ! '"What kind of doctor are you, River?"'
- ! '"Archeology," River replied, and Olivia''s eyes widened when she spotted a Silent
  behind her, but River only shot it, without turning to it and it fell dead to the
  floor.'
- ! '"Love a tomb."'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"River, you can let us fly it!"'
- ! '"Yeah, or we could go where we''re supposed to," River shot back as Olivia glanced
  up to see Rory and Amy making up with a kiss.'
- ! '"Knew it," she smirked as River stopped next to her at the console.'
- ! '"Me too," River smirked back.'
- ! '"Liv," the Doctor murmured, suddenly on the other side of her, making her gasp
  and look up at him with wide eyes.'
- ! '"Can I speak with you?"'
- ! '"Later," she replied, turning back to the console to operate it, making him frown.'
- ! '"Later?"'
- ! '"Yup," she nodded.'
- ! '"We gotta pick up Canton, drop him off with Nixon, then drop off River at her
  Storm Cage and after we do all that, we''ll talk."'
- ! '"Where''s she going?!"'
- ! '"Getting her jacket, I''d imagine," River replied, turning his gaze to her to
  stare at her in confusion at Olivia''s dismissal, making River smirk at him.'
- ! '"Don''t like it much?"'
- ! '"Oh…shut it," he shot back, realizing he''d been given a taste of his own medicine
  and River couldn''t help but chuckle as he began driving the TARDIS with her.'
- ! '"So we''re safe again," Nixon smiled, shaking the Doctor''s hand, Olivia leaning
  sideways on the TARDIS, River in the doorway, Rory on the other side of her and
  Amy on the couch near Olivia.'
- ! '"Safe?"'
- ! '"No, of course you''re not safe.'
- But you're not, really."
- ! '"Not helping, dear," Olivia called, catching the confused look on Nixon''s face.'
- ! '"Canton," the Doctor smiled, shaking Canton''s hand.'
- ! '"Until the next one, eh?"'
- ! '"Looking forward to it," Canton replied as the Doctor turned back to Nixon.'
- ! '"Canton just wants to get married," he told him.'
- ! '"Hell of a reason to kick him out of the FBI."'
- ! '"I''m sure something can be arranged," Nixon nodded.'
- ! '"I''m counting on you," the Doctor replied before heading toward the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Uh, Doctor," Nixon called, stopping him.'
- ! '"Canton, here, tells me you''re…you''re from the future.'
- It hardly seems possible, but I was wondering—"
- ! '"I should warn you," the Doctor cut in.'
- ! '"I don''t answer a lot of questions."'
- ! '"But I''m a president at the beginning of his time," Nixon insisted.'
- ! '"Dare I ask…will I be remembered?"'
- ! '"Why don''t I refer that to my American Liaison, Mrs.'
- Sigma?"
- ! '"Liv?"'
- ! '"Dicky," she smiled politely to Nixon.'
- ! '"Tricky Dicky.'
- They're never gonna forget you."
- ! '"Say ''Hi'' to David Frost for us."'
- ! '"David Frost?"'
- ! '"Seriously, River, you can let us drive," the Doctor said again.'
- ! '"We''re getting you back to the Storm Cage, yes?"'
- ! '"Yes," River sighed with a smile before glancing to Olivia, adding, "I''ll just
  go gather my things."'
- ! '"So," Olivia chirped, making the Doctor look up at her from his spot on the console
  as she turned to lean sideways on it, facing him.'
- ! '"What''s your angle?"'
- ! '"My what?"'
- ! '"You know what I''m talking about."'
- ! '"I have no idea."'
- ! '"Oh, like you thought I wouldn''t be affected back at the warehouse when you
  stood so close to me and I know you noticed it…"'
- ! '"Liv—"'
- ! '"Then that whole hand at the small of my back thing.'
- If I didn't know better, I'd say you were taking some tips from Jack Harkness's
  book of not-so-subtleties."
- ! '"Look, Liv, I honestly—"'
- ! '"Oh, and of course ''giving me the stage'' with the Silence and Nixon.'
- You love talking."
- ! '"Well, of course I do, but—"'
- ! '"Stop lying to me, Theta."'
- ! '"I''m not mad at you anymore, ok?'
- Just don't ask me any more questions."
- ! '"Yes, I won''t.'
- River scolded me about it already."
- ! '"I hate it when we fight," she whispered.'
- ! '"I know it''s not often but I still hate it."'
- ! '"I know," he murmured, hugging her shoulders and setting his cheek on her head.'
- ! '"I hate it, too.'
- And, to be honest, I was trying to get you to like me again."
- ! '"You know I can''t stay mad at you for long," she smirked.'
- ! '"And I''m glad of it," he smiled, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek before letting
  her go to operate the console.'
- ! '"Now, let''s get River back to prison!"'
- ! '"Let me drive, darling," Olivia requested.'
- ! '"River taught me all the tricks."'
- ! '"I can drive!"'
- ! '"See ya later, River," Olivia grinned as she hugged her tightly.'
- ! '"Soon for both of us, I hope," River smiled as she returned Olivia''s hug.'
- ! '"Really?"'
- ! '"I know you do this to him to tick him off, but do I really have to see this?"'
- ! '"See what?"'
- Amy wondered, Rory following her as they stepped to either side of Olivia and Amy
  smirked, "Are you spying?"
- ! '"No, the thing just turned itself on," Olivia replied, irritably.'
- ! '"Not my fault."'
- ! '"You could come with us," they heard the Doctor say from the screen.'
- ! '"I escape often enough, thank you," River smirked back before adding, "And I
  have a promise to live up to.'
- You'll understand soon enough."
- ! '"What does that mean?"'
- ! '"Ok.'
- Up to you," the Doctor replied, turning to head toward the TARDIS.
- ! '"See you next time.'
- Call me."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"That''s it?'
- What the matter with you?"
- ! '"Have I forgotten something?"'
- ! '"Oh, shut up," River grinned before grabbing his jacket to plant her lips to
  his.'
- ! '"Ew," Amy blurted, turning away from the screen to sit in the chair next to the
  console and Rory''s jaw dropped as Olivia''s eyes remained glued to the screen.'
- ! '"Olivia," Rory murmured.'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"Yeah, it''s just…this is the first time he''s kissed her."'
- ! '"So?"'
- ! '"Back to front."'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"You''re acting like we''ve never done that before."'
- ! '"We haven''t," the Doctor blurted as Olivia sagged back against the doorjamb
  of the TARDIS door.'
- ! '"We haven''t?"'
- ! '"Oh, look at the time.'
- Must be off," he muttered before looking back at her and smiling, "Um, but it was
  very nice.
- It was…unexpected."
- ! '"You know what they say," he smiled.'
- ! '"''There''s a first time for everything''."'
- ! '"And a last time," River murmured.'
- ! '"I''m sorry, River," Olivia breathed.'
- ! '"I''m so sorry."'
- ! '"Rory I''m going to need thermocouplings," the Doctor announced.'
- ! '"The green ones and the blue ones."'
- ! '"Ok, hold on," Rory replied, heading toward the small room at the bottom of another
  set of stairs as Olivia reached the console, still sulking.'
- ! '"Liv, you alright?"'
- ! '"I''m fine," she nodded with a slight smile before adding, "Enlightened."'
- ! '"So…Amy," Olivia smiled, drawing Amy''s attention to her.'
- ! '"You''re ok?"'
- ! '"Fine," Amy replied.'
- ! '"Head''s a bit…weird.'
- There's loads of stuff I can't quite…remember."
- ! '"Aftereffect of the Silence," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Natural enough.'
- But I don't think that's what she was asking."
- ! '"Nope," Olivia confirmed.'
- ! '"You told us you were pregnant," the Doctor continued as Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Because I was.'
- Turns out…I wasn't."
- ! '"Get that, but why did you tell us?"'
- ! '"Because you''re my friends.'
- You're my best friends."
- ! '"Did you tell Rory?"'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"Amy, why tell us and not tell Rory?"'
- ! '"Why do you think?"'
- ! '"Don''t know," he admitted.'
- ! '"I traveled with you in the TARDIS for so long.'
- I don't wanna tell Rory his baby might have three heads or like a…time head or something."
- ! '"What''s a time head?"'
- ! '"I don''t know, but what if it had one?"'
- ! '"A time head," Olivia laughed as the Doctor laughed as well.'
- ! '"Shut up!"'
- Amy laughed then looked to the room where Rory had been looking for those thermocouplings
  for a while and gently called, "Oi, stupid face!"
- ! '"Uh…yeah?"'
- ! '"Hello."'
- ! '"Taking that away from you if you''re gonna listen in all the time," Amy scolded
  as the Doctor and Olivia waved at him.'
- ! '"Ok, that''s a fair point," Rory admitted as he made his way up the stairs again.'
- ! '"But you should''ve told me that you thought you were pregnant.'
- I'm good with pregnancy."
- ! '"Not, as it turns out, that good," Amy chuckled, making her way to him when he
  was at the top of the stairs and wrapped her arms around his neck.'
- ! '"So, will you stop being stupid?"'
- ! '"Uh, no," Rory shot back, wrapping his arms around her waist and lifting her
  up to spin her as he finished, "I''m never ever gonna stop being stupid."'
- ! '"So," the Doctor called, running around the console, Olivia right behind him.'
- ! '"This little girl, it''s all about her.'
- Who was she?"
- He pulled the computer hanging above the console around to where he'd been standing,
  adding, "Or, we could just go off and have some adventures.
- You only live once."
- ! '"Me!"'
- ! '"I''m always in the mood for an adventure!"'
- ! '"I know, you are," the Doctor grinned before looking to the scanner and Olivia
  followed his gaze to it with a frown.'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! 'She looked up at it with a frown when she read "Amelia Pond: Full body scan in
  progress: Pregnancy" and next to that was a picture of Amy''s stomach, a sphere
  over it that read "Positive"…then "Negative" over and over again.'
- ! '"What''s that mean?"'
- ! '"I don''t know."'
- ! '"I never would''ve thought we could both fit in this swing," Olivia confessed
  to the Doctor as he sat in his repair swing under the console, Olivia sitting across
  his lap as he made repairs to the underside of the console.'
- ! '"Told you we would," he replied deftly, not looking away from his work.'
- ! '"Guess this is a better setup for repairs," she admitted.'
- ! '"Where''re the Ponds?"'
- ! '"Oh, probably kissing somewhere," he sneered, making her giggle as she lifted
  a hand to play with his bowtie, making him stop working to look down at her.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I have a question," he said, making her frown up at him.'
- ! '"Ok," she nodded.'
- ! '"As long as it''s not about—"'
- ! '"It isn''t," he cut in.'
- ! '"Fire away, my love," she smiled.'
- ! '"When we left River at the Storm Cage…you came back to the TARDIS upset," he
  recalled making her gaze meet his.'
- ! '"I could tell.'
- What happened?"
- ! '"I just realized how much stronger River is than I am," she whispered, making
  him frown in wonder.'
- ! '"What do you mean, stronger?"'
- ! '"I wouldn''t be able to do it," she murmured.'
- ! '"I wouldn''t be able to let you walk away from me after every adventure, not
  knowing when I''d see you again…if I saw you again.'
- It hurt me every time you left."
- ! '"Oh, Liv," he sighed, wrapping his arms around her to hug her tightly, setting
  his cheek on her hairline.'
- ! '"That doesn''t mean she''s stronger.'
- It wouldn't be your style to just sit and wait for me…never has been, and I love
  it."
- ! '"I just…admire her and feel sorry for her at the same time."'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"Hm?"'
- ! '"Is…Amy pregnant…or not?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," he murmured.'
- ! '"But I''m working on it.'
- Stop thinking."
- ! '"How did you know I was thinking?"'
- ! '"Because I''m thinking about the same things you are," he confessed, making her
  pull back enough to meet his gaze and he smirked, "Shall I go down the list?'
- How long is her sentence supposed to last—?"
- ! '"Theta," Olivia murmured, cutting him off and he looked to her in wonder as she
  smiled, "I was only thinking of those first three you listed.'
- Nothing really about River."
- ! '"U-Oh…" he sputtered and she noticed his cheeks redden only slightly before he
  went back to working on the console above him as she smiled in amusement when they
  fell into a comfortable silence.'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"Yes…?"'
- ! '"What would you say…if I was pregnant?"'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"Are you?!"'
- ! '"No," she replied, making him sigh in relief and she set her jaw in irritation
  at both reactions.'
- ! '"I guess it''s a good thing, if you''re gonna act like that."'
- ! '"Liv, I didn''t mean it that way," he explained.'
- ! '"I just…didn''t expect that kind of question."'
- ! '"Well…what would you say if I was?"'
- ! '"You of all people should know things don''t always go as you predict.'
- But we should wait for the right time."
- ! '"When''s the right time?"'
- ! '"W-What do you mean?"'
- ! '"Well…" she trailed off for a moment, feeling her cheeks heat under his expectant
  stare.'
- ! '"I know we''ve never really talked about it, but…I''d eventually like to have
  kids."'
- ! '"Oh…" he breathed before swallowing, hard.'
- ! '"W-Well…I don''t think right now is the best time for children."'
- ! '"Hence my question, when is the right time?"'
- ! '"I''ll have to think about it.'
- Right now, I think that's enough questions for today, don't you?"
- ! '"Actually, I have one more," she confessed, making him frown at her in wonder.'
- She smiled slyly before inching close to his ear to whisper, "Can we try out the
  new setting on my Sonic?"
- ! '"Sh-Sure," he choked before clearing his throat and looking to her.'
- ! '"Of course.'
- Why not?!"
- ! '"I have a feeling you''re gonna like it," Olivia smirked, sliding off his lap
  carefully to make her way out from under the console.'
- ! '"I''m certain I will," he agreed, following after her and leaving his Sonic to
  grab it later when he eventually returned to the control room.'
- ! '"Quick stop at mom''s?"'
- ! '"I need to pack a bag."'
- ! '"What for?"'
- ! '"The wardrobe can make anything you need, clothing wise."'
- ! '"I like some of the clothes in my wardrobe at home," Olivia smirked, pulling
  her phone from her pocket as she strolled toward him when he stopped at a section
  of the console.'
- ! '"And anyway, I bought something after you dropped me off with my mom that I think
  you''ll want me to wear later on."'
- ! '"Liv, stop doing that while I''m driving…and making repairs!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"How are you, sweetie?"'
- ! '"Fine, mom," she smiled, pulling a lever into place that the Doctor had lifted
  up and making him glare at her, comically.'
- ! '"We''re gonna come over tomorrow in the TARDIS.'
- I gotta pick up some stuff."
- ! '"Ok!'
- Amy and Rory, too?"
- ! '"Yup.'
- They're dying for some of that cake you made for my wedding."
- ! '"I''ll have it ready!'
- Love you!"
- ! '"Love you, too, mom," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"See you later!"'
- She hung up the phone and looked to the Doctor, saying, "Got that?
- Try to get us there on time, darling."
- ! '"Oh…shut it," he muttered, making her snicker.'
- ! '"Here we go!'
- Los Angeles; Felton house…front lawn."
- ! '"Thank you, love," Olivia grinned, skipping toward the door as Amy and Rory followed
  behind, the Doctor shutting the door behind them as Joyce ran from the front door
  of the house.'
- ! '"There''s tea and cake ready for you," Joyce grinned before hugging Olivia tightly
  then hugging the Doctor as well.'
- ! '"Amy, Rory, can I talk to you for a second," Olivia requested, taking one hand
  on each of them as the Doctor and Joyce spoke.'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"You can''t tell mom about what we saw," she whispered, making them frown at
  her in wonder.'
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Because…she won''t handle it well," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"She''ll end up telling him or freaking out…or both.'
- We saw River, we had an adventure, saved the world as usual, but that's it, ok?"
- ! '"Got it," Amy nodded as Rory gave a silent thumbs up, making Olivia smile and
  hug them both.'
- ! '"Thank you," she grinned before pulling away.'
- ! '"I''ll be upstairs.'
- I'll be down in a bit."
- ! '"Aaron!"'
- ! '"Surprise!"'
- Olivia threw herself into his arms and hugged him tightly as he explained, "Your
  mom told me not to tell you our visits were coinciding so I could surprise you."
- ! '"And a lovely surprise it is," the Doctor grinned, stepping into the doorway
  as Olivia stepped away from Aaron to let them shake hands.'
- ! '"How are you, Aaron?'
- How's Sarah Jane treating you?"
- ! '"Oh, she''s smashing, Doctor," Aaron grinned, pulling his suitcase in as everyone
  backed away to let him through.'
- ! '"She never stops talking about you!"'
- ! '"Alright, everyone in the kitchen," Joyce grinned, ushering them toward the kitchen
  and taking Aaron''s suitcase, hugging him tightly.'
- ! '"It''s nice to have a full house again."'
- ! '"Nice to be home, Mrs.'
- F," Aaron smiled, kissing her cheek as Olivia headed up the stairs.
- ! '"Everyone catch up!"'
- ! '"I''ll be down in a minute!"'
- ! '"Oh, no you don''t!"'
- ! '"I haven''t seen you since the wedding.'
- Sarah Jane's been asking about you two since I went back, so spill."
- ! '"Olivia?"'
- ! '"What happened?'
- You two fighting already?"
- ! '"No," Olivia sighed, pulling a duffle bag from her closet to fill it.'
- She was surprised at how calm she was as she spoke, still packing her bag as Aaron
  listened intently until she reached the end of her story, zipping her bag up and
  staring at it for a moment as she murmured, "We can't tell him, Aaron.
- Amy wants to, I can see it, and I can understand why, but if he knows…he'll try
  to prevent his own death, and then…"
- ! '"He''ll create a paradox," Aaron nodded in understanding when she trailed off
  and she looked to him with a smile.'
- ! '"I forget you understand this stuff now," she smirked.'
- ! '"Baby, I''m so sorry," he sighed, stepping toward her and wrapping his arms around
  her shoulders to hug her sideways.'
- ! '"I wish there was something I could do."'
- ! '"I just wanna know why," she sighed, resting her head on his shoulder.'
- ! '"Why did he do that to me?"'
- ! '"He didn''t just do it to you, babe," Aaron reminded her.'
- ! '"Amy and Rory and River were there too.'
- It hurt them just as much as it hurt you."
- ! '"But I still don''t…understand.'
- Was I…?"
- ! '"Stop it, Olivia."'
- ! '"You''re thinking.'
- Just stop."
- Olivia sniffled and wiped her face when a tear ran down her cheek then nodded, "You're
  right.
- I just…"
- ! '"I know," he nodded pulling her into him again to hug her close.'
- ! '"You know you can text me or call me whenever you need to talk, right?"'
- ! '"Yeah," she nodded.'
- ! '"I might take you up on that."'
- ! '"Good.'
- I want some of Mother Joyce's delicious cake."
- ! '"Liv!'
- Hurry up!"
- ! '"My husband''s in a hurry," Olivia smirked at Joyce as Aaron laughed before she
  turned and ran toward the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Coming!'
- Where are we going?"
- ! '"Anywhere we want!"'
- ! '"But we have to lift off first!"'
- ! '"Very funny," Olivia shot back as they ran up the stairs toward the console.'
- ! '"You act like I took an eternity!'
- It's like a book you've read once before and you just skip back through it to read
  over the good parts."
- ! '"That is very accurate," Rory pointed out as the two began flying the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Not unlike what Madame de Pompadour said about me once," the Doctor added.'
- ! '"You met Madame de Pompadour?"'
- ! '"Why am I not surprised?"'
- ! '"Now, Liv, don''t be bitter," the Doctor chided.'
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"Distress signal," he replied before turning to operate the console.'
- ! '"We following it?"'
- ! '"Of course," he chirped, before the TARDIS came to a shuddering halt.'
- ! '"Right!'
- Let's see what we find!"
- ! '"Where and when are we?"'
- ! '"Seventeenth century!"'
- ! '"On a ship."'
- ! '"A seventeenth century ship with the ability to send a distress signal that a
  spaceship could pick up?"'
- ! '"I know," he grinned before pulling her out the door and into the dark bilge
  of a ship, water splashing around their feet as Amy and Rory followed.'
- ! '"Now, let''s find out what''s going on here."'
- ! '"Yo, ho, ho!"'
- ! '"Or does nobody actually say that?"'
- ! '"We made no signal," the captain argued after the Doctor explained their presence.'
- ! '"Our sensors picked you up," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"''Ship in distress''."'
- ! '"Sensors?"'
- ! '"Yes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Simplify, darling," Olivia suggested from behind him.'
- ! '"It''s the seventeenth century, remember?'
- Problem word."
- ! '"Right," the Doctor nodded before explaining.'
- ! '"My ship automatically noticed-ish that your ship was having some bother."'
- ! '"That big, blue crate?"'
- ! '"That''s more magic, Captain Avery," his first mate objected.'
- ! '"They''re spirits.'
- How else would they have found their way belowdecks?"
- ! '"Well…I want to say multidimensional engineering but since you had a problem
  with sensors, I won''t go there," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Look, I''m the Doctor, this is Amy, Rory, Olivia."'
- He stepped toward Avery and lightly punched his arm, grinning, "We're sailors!
- Arr!"
- ! '"Except for the gun thing," the Doctor added.'
- ! '"And the beardiness."'
- ! '"You''re stowaways!"'
- ! '"Only explanation.'
- You must have stowed away before we sailed."
- ! '"What do we do with them?"'
- ! '"Oh, I think they deserve our hospitality," Avery replied, making the Doctor
  grin.'
- ! '"Stop grinning, Doctor," Olivia ordered gently, making him frown at her.'
- ! '"Take them on deck and set the plank out," Avery ordered.'
- ! '"Oh," the Doctor blurted before they were all grabbed by their arms and dragged
  from the cabin.'
- ! '"Well, this isn''t good."'
- ! '"What was your first clue?!"'
- ! '"The Doctor will go first!"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"I suppose laughing like that is in the job description," the Doctor guessed,
  balancing on the plank.'
- ! '"''Can you do the laugh?'
- Welcome aboard.'"
- ! '"Now is not the time to be snarky!"'
- ! '"Stocks are low," Avery explained.'
- ! '"Only one barrel of water remains.'
- They won't need much feeding."
- ! '"Oh, hell no!'
- Let me go!"
- ! '"Rory, a little help!"'
- ! '"Yeah, hey!'
- They're not doxies," Rory told them.
- ! '"I didn''t mean just tell him off, but thanks anyway," Amy shot back before she
  was shoved down a hatch, Olivia right behind her.'
- ! '"Come on, Amy, let''s find something to fight back with," she whispered and Amy
  opened a chest to find loads of swords inside.'
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Look!"
- ! '"What are all these swords doing in here?"'
- ! '"The men should be wearing them.'
- They shouldn't be stashed away like this."
- ! '"Who cares?'
- Just take one and let's get up there!"
- ! '"Here, take this," Olivia told her, tossing her a coat as she put one on herself
  and as she passed Amy to head up the stairs she placed a hat on her head.'
- ! '"Let''s go."'
- ! '"Where are the rest of the crew?"'
- ! '"This is a big ship.'
- I suppose the rest of them are hiding someplace…" The Doctor plugged his nose, continuing,
  "…and they're all gonna jump out and shout 'Boo!'"
- ! '"Boo!"'
- ! '"Throw the gun down," Amy ordered, and Avery looked terrified as he set the gun
  near their feet and Olivia kicked it away.'
- ! '"On your knees, lads," Olivia ordered.'
- ! '"Amy, Olivia, what are you doing?"'
- ! '"Saving your life," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Ok with that, are you?"'
- ! '"Put down the swords," Avery ordered.'
- ! '"A sword could kill us all."'
- ! '"Yeah, kinda of why we''re pointing them at you," Olivia smirked back.'
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Over here!"
- ! '"You have killed me," he told her as everyone stilled.'
- ! '"No way!"'
- ! '"It''s just a cut!'
- What kind of rubbish pirates are you?"
- ! '"One drop, that''s all it takes," Avery explained.'
- ! '"One drop of blood, and she''ll rise out of the ocean."'
- ! '"Come on, I barely even scratched him.'
- What are you all in such a huff about?!"
- ! '"Amy!'
- Look out!"
- ! '"Uh, Doctor what''s happening to me?"'
- ! '"She can smell the blood on your skin," Avery explained.'
- ! '"She''s marked you for death."'
- ! '"She?"'
- ! '"A demon," Avery replied.'
- ! '"Out there, in the ocean."'
- ! '"Ok, groovy!"'
- ! '"So not just pirates today.'
- I mean, if something's going to kill you it's nice that it drops you a note to remind
  you."
- ! '"Get off me!"'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"Doctor," she called, warily before looking up at him in panic then lifting her
  palm to show it to him and he marched toward her to examine her hand.'
- ! '"Am I gonna die?"'
- ! '"You and I both know that demons and ghosts and such are usually just things
  from other planets in a form we recognize as something supernatural," he murmured
  to her, lifting a hand to her chin to bring her gaze to his.'
- ! '"Trust me, Liv."'
- ! '"Of course I trust you, but—"'
- ! '"Quickly, now," one of the men ordered.'
- ! '"Block out the sound."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"The creature," Avery explained.'
- ! '"She charms all her victims with that song."'
- ! '"Oh, great," Rory shot back.'
- ! '"So put my fingers in my ears.'
- That's your plan?"
- ! '"Doctor, come on, let''s get back to the…" Olivia trailed off into a sudden fit
  of giggles as Rory and the pirate Amy had cut grinned like fools.'
- ! '"The music," the first mate realized.'
- ! '"It''s working on them."'
- ! '"You are so beautiful!"'
- ! '"I love your getup.'
- Hey…hey…cuddle me, shipmate."
- ! '"Rory, stop!"'
- ! '"Olivia," the Doctor called cautiously as she giggled at the scene before turning
  to him and throwing herself into his arms.'
- ! '"Doctor, my Doctor!"'
- she grinned before taking his face into her hands, squishing it into a funny face
  as she breathed, "Everything is just brilliant!
- I'm sorry."
- ! '"I''d like a beard," Rory chimed in before stumbling toward the other pirate
  to tell him, "I''m gonna grow a beard."'
- ! '"You''re not!"'
- ! '"You could grow your beard back, darling," Olivia told the Doctor, still holding
  onto his face and now moving her hands over his cheeks, puckering her lips as she
  added, "And you can dress like a pirate, too."'
- ! '"Liv…really scaring me right now," the Doctor warned, his voice muffled as she
  still squished his face.'
- ! '"The music turns them into fools," Avery explained as the Doctor pulled Olivia''s
  hands from his face but didn''t let her wrists go.'
- ! '"Oh, my god," Amy blurted as she stared out to sea, sending everyone''s gaze
  in that direction.'
- Rory forced his way toward her as Amy still held onto her, crying, "I have to touch
  her!
- Let me touch her!"
- Amy shoved Rory aside and marched a step ahead to snap at the Siren, "Sorry, but
  he is spoken for."
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"Everybody into the hold!'
- Take her!"
- ! '"No!'
- Let me touch her!"
- ! '"Rory!"'
- They all stumbled down the stairs into the hold of the ship before Amy demanded,
  "What the hell was that thing?"
- ! '"A legend," Avery replied.'
- ! '"A Siren.'
- She's been hunting us ever since we were becalmed, picking off the injured."
- ! '"Like a shark," the first mate added.'
- ! '"A shark can smell blood."'
- ! '"Ok," the Doctor nodded, trying to ignore Olivia stumbling all over him, but
  he wrapped an arm around her waist to steady her against him.'
- ! '"Just like a shark…in a dress…and singing…and green!'
- A green, singing shark in an evening gown."
- ! '"The ship is cursed!"'
- ! '"Yeah, right, curses, big with humans," the Doctor noticed.'
- ! '"It means bad things are happening, but you can''t be bothered to find an explanation."'
- ! '"She''s the most beautiful thing I''ve ever seen," Rory blurted out to Amy.'
- ! '"Actually, I think you''ll find she isn''t," Amy retorted before leaning toward
  the Doctor as Rory hugged her close and she ordered, "We have to leave, right now."'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"I wanna stay!'
- There's pirates!"
- ! '"That crate of yours really is a ship?"'
- ! '"Well, it''s not propelled by the wind," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Show me!"'
- ! '"Weigh anchor.'
- Make it sail."
- ! '"And the gun''s back," the Doctor noticed, irritably.'
- ! '"You''re big on the gun thing, aren''t you?'
- No."
- He leaned his head back to wishfully sigh, "Comfy sofa."
- ! '"Leave the cursed ones, Captain," one of the men suggested.'
- ! '"The creature can have them."'
- ! '"Yes, please," Rory blurted, but the Doctor slapped a hand over Olivia''s mouth
  when her eyes lit up and she was about to say something similar.'
- ! '"Not a chance," the Doctor replied for her.'
- ! '"We don''t want the Siren coming after us," Avery told the Doctor.'
- ! '"It''s a leech!"'
- ! '"Everyone, out of the water!"'
- ! '"It''s bitten me," the sailor realized, pulling it off him to reveal a trail
  of blood.'
- ! '"I''m bleeding!"'
- ! '"She''s wants blood," the Doctor theorized.'
- ! '"Why does she want blood?"'
- ! '"What were you saying about leaving the cursed ones behind?"'
- ! '"It''s ok," the Doctor reassured them.'
- ! '"We''re safe down here.'
- No curse is getting through three solid inches of timber."
- ! '"Hello, again," he said, pulling Olivia back with all his strength.'
- ! '"Really, Liv, now''s not the time to try to make my dreams come true."'
- ! '"I have to touch her!"'
- ! '"Any other time you''d have slapped me for saying that," the Doctor observed,
  pulling her back with the group as the other sailor''s tried to pull their friend
  back.'
- ! '"Safe?"'
- ! '"I have my good days and my bad days," the Doctor defended, using his Sonic on
  the hat.'
- ! '"How did she get in?"'
- ! '"Bilge water," he explained.'
- ! '"She''s using water like a portal…a door.'
- We need to go somewhere with no water."
- ! '"Well, thank god we''re not in the middle of the ocean!"'
- ! '"Did you see her eyes?"'
- ! '"Like crystal pools."'
- ! '"You are in enough trouble," Amy scoffed, forgiving since she knew he was under
  alien influence.'
- ! '"The magazine," Avery suggested.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"He means the armory where the powder''s stored," the Doctor explained then grunted
  when Olivia threw her arms around him, slamming into his chest.'
- ! '"It''s dry as a bone," Avery assured them.'
- ! '"Good, let''s go there," the Doctor said.'
- ! '"I give the orders," Avery told him, pointing his gun in the Doctor''s face again.'
- ! '"Ah," the Doctor hummed with a slight smirk.'
- ! '"Worried because I''m wearing a hat now."'
- He hurried past the three sailors, dragging a giggling Olivia with him as Amy struggled
  with a drunk-like Rory and he reminded them, "Nobody touch anything sharp!"
- ! '"Quickly, man," Avery urged.'
- ! '"The key''s gone, Captain," he replied.'
- ! '"How could it have gone?!"'
- ! '"Someone else had the same idea," the Doctor observed.'
- ! '"Barricade the door," Avery ordered as his first mate lit a lantern and pulled
  it from its hook on the ceiling.'
- ! '"Careful of that lantern.'
- Every barrel is full of powder."
- ! '"Who''s been sleeping in my gunroom?"'
- His eyes went wide as he reached in and pulled a child from the barrel, shoving
  him against the wall and growling, "You fool!
- What are you doing here?"
- ! '"Who is he?"'
- ! '"What?'
- He's not one of the crew?"
- ! '"No," Avery sighed.'
- ! '"He''s my son."'
- ! '"What in god''s name possessed you, boy?"'
- ! '"Your mother will be searching for you."'
- ! '"When?"'
- ! '"Last winter," Toby explained.'
- ! '"Fever.'
- An honorable man, she said…how I'd be proud to know you."
- ! '"I''ve come to join your crew."'
- ! '"I don''t want you here."'
- ! '"You can''t send me back.'
- We're a hundred miles from home."
- ! '"It''s dangerous here.'
- She leaves a mark on men's skin."
- ! '"The black spot?"'
- ! '"I wanna stay with him," she murmured, meeting his gaze and he gave a smile.'
- ! '"Feeling yourself again, are you?"'
- ! '"Yeah," she nodded before rubbing her temples.'
- ! '"Just a headache."'
- ! '"You should stay with Amy and Rory," he advised.'
- ! '"But…"'
- ! '"Please," he urged, making her nod as she stepped toward the couple as Rory was
  starting to feel like himself as he examined his cut.'
- ! '"There''s nothing wrong with the boy," Avery reported to them.'
- ! '"He has no scars."'
- ! '"Yep," the Doctor sighed.'
- ! '"Ignore my last theory."'
- ! '"He has his good days and his bad days," Amy chimed in.'
- ! '"It''s not just blood," he resumed.'
- ! '"She''s coming for all the sick and wounded."'
- ! '"Like a hunter picking off the weakest animal," Olivia compared.'
- ! '"Exactly," the Doctor nodded.'
- ! '"Good to have you back, Liv."'
- ! '"Ok, look, he''s got a fever.'
- The Siren knows it," Amy observed.
- ! '"Humans," the Doctor hummed.'
- ! '"Second rate.'
- Let's go."
- ! '"You''re not the captain here, remember?"'
- ! '"The water''s dangerous!"'
- ! '"That''s how she gets through!'
- One touch of her hand and you're a dead man!"
- ! '"Stop yelling at him!"'
- ! '"He didn''t know, did he?!"'
- ! '"We''re all cursed if we stay aboard," the first mate prophesied.'
- ! '"It''s not a curse," the Doctor argued.'
- ! '"Curse means game over.'
- Captain, what's out next move?"
- ! '"Wait with the boy," he ordered his men.'
- ! '"Captain, we''re all in danger here," the first mate reminded her as he and the
  other sailor moved the barricade from the door.'
- ! '"I said wait," Avery ordered.'
- ! '"And barricade the door after we''ve gone."'
- ! '"You sure you wanna go?"'
- ! '"We have to get Liv, Rory and Toby away," he said.'
- ! '"She''s out there now, licking her lips, boiling the saucepan, grating the cheese."'
- ! '"Ok," Amy drawled.'
- ! '"Well remember, if you get an itch…don''t scratch too hard."'
- ! '"We''ve all gotta go sometime," the Doctor smirked, making Amy and Rory glance
  at each other as Olivia stood next to Toby, a protective hand around his shoulders.'
- ! '"There are worse ways than having your face knocked off by a dodgy mermaid."'
- ! '"Doctor, stop it," Olivia pleaded softly, drawing his attention to her and he
  stepped closer to her in time to catch her when she threw her arms around his neck.'
- ! '"I wanna go with you, but I know I can''t.'
- Please be careful."
- ! '"I''ll be right back, Liv," he promised, pressing a kiss to her cheek before
  pulling back enough to smile warmly at her.'
- ! '"Kiss for luck?"'
- Olivia watched Amy pace as she sat with Toby, Rory stepping up to his wife and asking,
  "What's wrong?"
- Amy stopped, her back facing Rory and he leaned over to see her face as she muttered,
  "The most beautiful thing you've ever seen."
- ! '"Oh, tell me I didn''t really say that," he groaned.'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"We''re not staying here to molly-coddle the boy," the first mate retorted.'
- ! '"The Captain''s gone soft.'
- It's time for us to leave."
- ! '"He told you to wait, you dog," Toby shot back, and Olivia placed a hand on his
  shoulder to keep him from advancing on the men.'
- ! '"He''s your captain.'
- You're honor-bound to do as he tells you."
- ! '"Honor-bound?"'
- ! '"Do you know what kind of ship this is?'
- Do you know what your father does?"
- ! '"Don''t listen to him, Toby," Amy advised.'
- ! '"We sail under the black flag…the Jolly Roger," the first mate continued.'
- ! '"Liar!"'
- ! '"He''s not a wicked pirate!"'
- ! '"Oh, you think so?"'
- ! '"I''ve seen your father gun down a thousand innocent men."'
- ! '"Get what treasure you can," the first mate told the other sailor.'
- ! '"I''ll meet you in the rowboat."'
- ! '"You''re going to remain at your post," Toby ordered, coming between Amy and
  Rory to point a cutlass at the pirates.'
- ! '"I''m not playing games with you, boy," the first mate warned, eyeing the sword
  warily.'
- ! '"You put that down."'
- ! '"One more step, and I''ll use this, you blackguard," Toby ground out.'
- ! '"You don''t know how to fight with a cutlass, boy," the first mate assumed.'
- ! '"I reckon he doesn''t need to," Olivia realized.'
- ! '"You little swabber," he shuddered.'
- ! '"Congratulations," Amy retorted.'
- ! '"Made it to the menu."'
- ! '"I wouldn''t go out there, if I were you," Olivia advised.'
- ! '"You scurvy ape!"'
- ! '"Don''t shoot!"'
- ! '"The powder will blow and kill us all!"'
- The sailor grabbed the keys from the first mate's belt, making him question, "Mulligan,
  what are you doing?"
- ! '"No honor among pirates," Amy mocked him.'
- ! '"I''m sure the Doctor''s fine, Olivia," Rory assured her.'
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Open the door!"
- ! '"Ok, that was weird…even for him," Olivia muttered and was about to follow him,
  but Amy grabbed her arm.'
- ! '"Where are you going?"'
- ! '"You can''t go out there.'
- The Siren will get you."
- ! '"Oh…" Olivia trailed off, looking at the spot on her hand and forlornly.'
- ! '"Just wait?"'
- ! '"Not my most dynamic plan, I realize," the Doctor conceded.'
- ! '"TARDIS," Amy suggested.'
- ! '"It''s been towed," he reported, making Olivia stare at him with wide eyes.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Sorry, we might be stuck here for a while," he added, trying to avoid Olivia''s
  burning gaze before finally turning to her, saying, "It wasn''t my fault!'
- We could've been thrown into the Vortex and ended up anywhere!"
- ! '"So you''re saying we should all just wait here below?"'
- ! '"The sea is still calm, like a mirror," Avery explained.'
- ! '"If we go out on deck she''ll rise up and attack you."'
- ! '"It''s ok," the Doctor assured them.'
- ! '"The calm won''t last forever.'
- When the wind picks up, we'll all set sail."
- ! '"Until it does, you have to hide down here," Avery ordered.'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"It''s raining!"'
- He reached out and grabbed her wrist to pull her out the door, "Come on!
- All hands on deck!"
- ! '"Quit doddling, wench!"'
- ! '"Get to work on that rigging!"'
- ! '"Aye, Captain!'
- Aye!"
- ! '"Let go the sail!"'
- ! '"Avast, ye!'
- Put the banding at the second, the clews!"
- ! '"I swear he''s making half this stuff up!"'
- ! '"Well, we''re gonna need some kind of phrase book!"'
- ! '"Toby!"'
- ! '"Find my coat!'
- My compass is inside it, boy!"
- Toby went down to the hold as Avery shouted at the rest, "Heave-ho, you bilge rats!"
- ! '"Rats was all I could hear!"'
- ! '"Don''t let her take you!"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Stop her!"'
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Stop!"
- ! '"So…beautiful," Olivia breathed, stepping toward her.'
- ! '"Get away!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Ok," she drawled.'
- ! '"I''m definitely not on a sailing ship."'
- ! '"Where''s Rory?"'
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Doctor!"
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"Doctor, are you ok?"'
- ! '"Fine," he groaned before looking around with a frown as Amy and Avery awoke
  was well.'
- ! '"God, now I know how you feel when Rory and I kiss in front of you," Amy sneered
  in disgust as Avery stared around the room in awe.'
- ! '"Get up and get a room!"'
- ! '"I''m glad you''re alright," he murmured.'
- ! '"So am I," she smirked before shoving off of him and helping him stand.'
- ! '"Where are we?"'
- ! '"We haven''t moved," the Doctor replied, looking out the window in front of them.'
- ! '"We''re in exactly the same place as before."'
- ! '"We''re on a ghost ship," Avery guessed.'
- ! '"It''s real," Olivia corrected.'
- ! '"It''s a spaceship trapped in a temporal rift."'
- ! '"How can two ships be in the same place?"'
- ! '"Not the same," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Two planes, two worlds.'
- Two cars parked in the same place."
- ! '"See, there''s lots of different universes inside each other," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"Once in a while they collide so that you can step from one to the other."'
- ! '"Ok," Amy nodded.'
- ! '"I…I understand."'
- ! '"Good, ''cause it''s not like that at all, but if that helps…" the Doctor retorted,
  trailing off as Olivia rolled her eyes at him.'
- ! '"Thanks," Amy retorted at him.'
- ! '"All the reflections have suddenly become gateways," he resumed before grabbing
  something from the floor and tossing it toward the window.'
- ! '"Ever look in a mirror and think you''re seeing a whole other world?'
- Well, this time it's not an illusion."
- ! '"A signal," Amy realized.'
- ! '"Yeah," the Doctor replied, heading up a set of stairs with Olivia right behind
  him, Avery following the three.'
- ! '"A distress call," Olivia added.'
- ! '"This is the one we picked up.'
- There was a second ship here the whole time."
- They fell silent when they heard singing and the Doctor murmured, "The Siren is
  onboard."
- ! '"It''s dead," Olivia assured him before they inched past it and into the hall
  they''d revealed, stepping into a cockpit with a window with a view of Avery''s
  cabin on his ship.'
- ! '"You were right," Amy told the Doctor as he stepped next to the skeleton slumped
  in one of the two seats to examine.'
- ! '"There was something staring at us the whole time.'
- How long has this ship been marooned here?"
- ! '"Long enough for the captain to have run out of grog," Avery guessed.'
- ! '"So if this is the captain, what''s the Siren?"'
- ! '"Same as us," he answered.'
- ! '"A stowaway."'
- ! '"She killed it," Amy guessed of the captain''s death as he looked at the results.'
- ! '"Human bacteria," the Doctor corrected.'
- ! '"An airborne virus from our planet traveling through the portal," Olivia realized
  as the Doctor moved to lean on the console in front of the skeleton.'
- ! '"That''s what did it.'
- Like War of the Worlds."
- ! '"It didn''t get its…jabs," the Doctor said, drawing out the last word in surprised
  disgust before he lifted his hand from the console to present it to them.'
- ! '"Ah…look."'
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"Sneeze!"'
- ! '"Alien bogeys!"'
- ! '"Ew," Olivia sneered.'
- ! '"McGrath!"'
- ! '"He''s one of my men."'
- ! '"He''s still breathing," Amy assured him.'
- ! '"My entire crew is here," Avery realized, looking around.'
- ! '"Toby!"'
- ! '"Rory!"'
- ! '"The TARDIS!"'
- ! '"We have to get him out of here," Avery insisted, making to remove the thing
  around the boy''s neck.'
- ! '"Wait!"'
- ! '"Looks like his fever''s gone."'
- ! '"He looks so well," Amy observed.'
- ! '"She''s keeping him alive," the Doctor explained, looking to his results as Olivia
  hurried to Amy''s side.'
- ! '"His brain is synaptic, but all its cellular activity is suspended."'
- ! '"Doctor, look," Olivia urged, lifting Rory''s hand to show a thin glass case
  under it.'
- ! '"The black spot is a tissue sample.'
- Why would she take samples of people she's about to kill?"
- ! '"Help me get him up?"'
- ! '"She''s coming," the Doctor whispered.'
- ! '"Anesthetic," the Doctor whispered in realization as they watched her glide toward
  Toby''s body.'
- ! '"The music, the song.'
- So she anesthetizes people then puts their body in stasis."
- ! '"Avery!'
- No!"
- ! '"Fire," the Doctor blurted as the Siren came toward them.'
- ! '"Doctor…" Olivia called, warily as she slowly backed away, eyeing the Siren.'
- ! '"That''s new.'
- What does fire do?"
- ! '"Burns."'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Destroys."'
- ! '"What else?"'
- ! '"Burns!"'
- ! '"Sterilize!"'
- ! '"You sneezed!'
- You've got germs!"
- ! '"Amy, stop," the Doctor called as the Siren marched toward her, still glowing
  red.'
- ! '"Don''t interfere.'
- Don't touch him."
- ! '"Anesthetic, tissue samples, screens, sterile working conditions—what does it
  mean?!"'
- ! '"Ignore all my previous theories!"'
- ! '"Yeah?'
- Well we stopped paying attention a while back!"
- ! '"Oh, my god!'
- Doctor!"
- ! '"Right, Liv!'
- She's not a killer at all, she's a doctor!"
- ! '"This is an automated sick bay.'
- A virtual doctor, able to sterilize a whole room."
- ! '"Able to burn your face off," Amy added.'
- ! '"She''s just an interface, seeped through the join between the planes, broadcast
  in our world," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Protein circuitry means she can change her form and become a human doctor for
  humans.'
- Sister, you are good!"
- ! '"She won''t let us take them," Avery stated, stepping toward Toby''s side.'
- ! '"She''s keeping them alive," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"But I don''t think she knows how to heal them."'
- ! '"I''m his wife, for God''s sake," Amy ground out.'
- ! '"Why can''t I touch him?"'
- ! '"Amy, tell her," Olivia urged, stepping next to her and lifting her hand to show
  the Siren her ring.'
- ! '"She''s virtual but she''s smart.'
- That's gotta be somewhere in her program if she can change into a human."
- ! '"Look, he''s very ill, ok?"'
- ! '"I just want to look after him.'
- Why won't you let me near my husband?!"
- ! '"Consent form," the Doctor explained to Amy.'
- ! '"Sign it.'
- You have to take full responsibility."
- ! '"He can''t breathe!'
- Turn it back on!"
- ! '"What do we do?"'
- ! '"I can''t just leave him here."'
- ! '"He''ll die if we try to take him out," Olivia murmured as Amy leaned over Rory.'
- ! '"Rory, wake up," Amy whispered, and he opened his eyes with a slight groan.'
- ! '"Where am I?"'
- ! '"You''re in a hospital," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"If you leave, you might die."'
- ! '"But if you don''t, you''ll have to stay forever," Amy murmured.'
- ! '"Y-You''re saying that, if I don''t get up now…" Rory trailed off with a frown.'
- ! '"You can never leave," Amy finished for him.'
- ! '"The Siren will take care of you," Olivia assured him.'
- ! '"And if I come with you?"'
- ! '"Drowning, on the point of death," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"I''m a nurse," Rory said, looking to Amy.'
- ! '"I can teach you how to save me."'
- ! '"Whoa, hold on," Amy blurted.'
- ! '"I was drowning," Rory recalled.'
- ! '"You just have to resuscitate me."'
- ! '"Just?"'
- ! '"You''ve seen them do it loads of times in films.'
- CPR…'The Kiss of Life'."
- ! '"Rory, his isn''t a film, ok?'
- What if I do it wrong?"
- ! '"You won''t."'
- ! '"Ok, what if you don''t come back to life?'
- What if—?"
- ! '"I trust you."'
- ! '"What about him?"'
- ! '"I mean why do I have to be the one?'
- Why do I have to save you?"
- ! '"Because I know you''ll never give up."'
- ! '"We have to send this ship back into space," the Doctor told him.'
- ! '"I mean, imagine if the Siren got ashore.'
- She would try to process every injured human."
- ! '"What about Toby?"'
- ! '"He has Typhoid Fever," Olivia murmured.'
- ! '"If he goes back…it''s only a matter of time."'
- ! '"What if I stay with him, here?"'
- ! '"The Siren will look after him and…I can''t go back to England.'
- What home does he have now, if not with me?"
- ! '"Do you think you can sail this thing?"'
- ! '"Just point me to the atom accelerator," Avery smirked, making the Doctor scoff
  and Olivia frowned between them but said nothing.'
- ! '"I know you can do this," Rory assured Amy then added, "Of course if you muck
  it up, I am gonna be really cross…and dead."'
- Amy couldn't help but chuckle before murmuring, "I'll see you in a minute."
- ! '"Come on, Rory," the Doctor urged.'
- ! '"Not here, not this way.'
- Not today!"
- Amy tried once more before sobbing, "He trusted me.
- He trusted me to save him."
- ! '"You still can, Amy," Olivia assured her.'
- ! '"You can still do this.'
- Come on!"
- ! '"Rory, don''t do this to her," Olivia murmured, gripping the Doctor''s sleeve
  tightly.'
- ! '"I thought I was an excellent pirate," Amy smiled as she and Rory went up the
  stairs, heading for their room.'
- ! '"I thought you were an excellent nurse," Rory retorted.'
- ! '"Easy, tiger," Amy smirked before they stopped at the top step and turning toward
  the Doctor and Olivia as they stood at the console.'
- ! '"Good night, you two."'
- ! '"Night, guys," Olivia grinned, sailing up next to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Good night, Amelia," he smiled before looking to the screen above the console.'
- ! '"You only call me Amelia when you''re worried about me."'
- ! '"I always worry about you," he replied.'
- ! '"Mutual," she agreed, softly.'
- ! '"Go to bed, Pond," he ordered, firmly and they turned back to head to their room.'
- ! '"Yes, Liv?"'
- ! '"You worry about me?"'
- ! '"Of course I do, darling," he smiled warmly, leaning toward her and pressed a
  kiss to her forehead before looking to Amy''s scan on the screen again.'
- ! '"But there''s something wrong with Amelia.'
- I have to find out what it is."
- ! '"And then we discovered it wasn''t the Robot King after all, it was the real
  one," the Doctor explained one his adventures.'
- ! '"Fortunately, I was able to reattach the head."'
- ! '"Do you believe any of this stuff?"'
- ! '"I was there," she blurted as she passed Olivia who was reclining on the console.'
- ! '"At least one of us was," Olivia complained.'
- ! '"He left me sleeping one off in here!"'
- ! '"It''s your own fault, you had far too many Hyper Vodkas the night before," the
  Doctor scolded, looking to the console when lights flashed above them.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- They never stop!"
- ! '"Just like you sometimes…in many things," Olivia smirked as he stepped up next
  to her to examine the console.'
- ! '"Like last night when we—"'
- ! '"Liv!"'
- he squeaked, glancing to Amy and Rory as they spoke on the other side of the console
  and whispered, "Not while they're in the room.
- Why must you bring it up now, when we're not alone?"
- ! '"Oh, it''s up?"'
- ! '"Olivia Felton!'
- You—!"
- ! '"What was that?"'
- ! '"The door," the Doctor replied, cautiously heading down the stairs.'
- ! '"It knocked."'
- ! '"Right," Rory began as he and Amy stopped at the railing around the console.'
- ! '"We are in deep space?"'
- ! '"Very, very deep," Olivia confirmed as the Doctor still approached the door.'
- The knock of 'Shave and a Haircut' came from it again as she frowned, "Somebody's
  knocking…in deep space."
- The Doctor slowly opened the door and stared outside for a moment then smirked,
  "Oh, come here.
- Come here, you scrumptious little beauty."
- ! '"That''s my cue," Olivia grinned, fluffing her hair before hurrying down the
  stairs, but when she reached the door her grin instantly fell as she blurted, "Oh."'
- ! '"A box?"'
- ! '"Doctor, what is it?"'
- ! '"I''ve got mail!"'
- he grinned, making them all frown at in wonder before he ran up the stairs toward
  the console, Olivia right behind him as he still examined the box as he excitedly
  explained, "Time Lord emergency messaging system.
- Anyway, there's a living Time Lord still out there, and it's one of the good ones!"
- ! '"But…you said there weren''t any Time Lords left," Olivia recalled, watching
  him type at the console.'
- ! '"There aren''t," he confirmed, making her frown.'
- ! '"No Time Lords left anywhere in the universe, but the universe isn''t where we''re
  going!"'
- ! '"See that snake?'
- She was a bad girl!"
- ! '"Oh, that makes me feel a lot better!"'
- ! '"Why don''t we just invite River over and make a day of it with you, huh?!'
- What is it with you and the female gender?!"
- ! '"What is happening?!"'
- ! '"We''re leaving the universe!"'
- ! '"How can you leave the universe?!"'
- ! '"With enormous difficulty!"'
- ! '"Right now I''m burning up TARDIS rooms to give us some welly!'
- Sayonara, squash court 7!"
- ! '"Doctor, where are we?"'
- ! '"Outside the universe," he breathed.'
- ! '"Where we''ve never, ever been."'
- ! '"Is that meant to be happening?"'
- ! '"The power''s draining," Olivia explained, not looking away from the console.'
- ! '"Everything''s draining."'
- ! '"But it can''t that''s…that''s impossible," the Doctor breathed.'
- ! '"What is that?"'
- ! '"It''s as if the matrix…the soul of the TARDIS, has just vanished."'
- ! '"But…where would it go?"'
- ! '"Well…best have a look outside then and find the Corsair," the Doctor supposed,
  taking Olivia''s hand and pulling her toward the door, though he wasn''t as enthusiastic
  as before.'
- ! '"What kind of trouble was your friend in?"'
- ! '"He was in a bind," the Doctor replied as he continued walking.'
- ! '"A bit of a pickle, sort of…distressed."'
- ! '"You can say you don''t know, my love," Olivia smiled up at him, but her smile
  fell as he glanced around at the junk, his hand still gripping hers tightly, and
  she could feel his unease, knowing he was worrying about whatever was wrong with
  the TARDIS.'
- ! '"What is this place, the scrap yard at the end of the universe?"'
- ! '"Not end of, outside of," the Doctor corrected.'
- ! '"How can we be outside the universe?"'
- ! '"The universe is everything."'
- ! '"Imagine a huge soap bubble with a tiny bubble on the outside," Olivia explained
  as the Doctor pulled her back toward the TARDIS, Rory following.'
- ! '"Ok," he nodded in understanding.'
- ! '"But it''s nothing like that," the Doctor retorted, making Olivia sigh as Rory
  rolled his eyes when they reached the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Completely drained!'
- Look at her."
- ! '"Wait, so we''re in a tiny bubble universe sticking to the side of the bigger
  bubble universe?"'
- ! '"Yeah," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"No!"'
- the Doctor argued, then added, "But if it helps…yes."
- ! '"This place is filled with rift energy," Olivia thought aloud then looked to
  the Doctor.'
- ! '"She might refuel just by sitting here."'
- ! '"Good thinking, Liv," he nodded before lifting her hand and kissing it then finally
  let it go to lean down and pick up a rock.'
- ! '"Now, this place, what do we think, eh?"'
- ! '"Gravity''s almost Earth-normal.'
- But it smells, like…"
- ! '"Armpits," Amy finished when he trailed off, tossing the spoon away.'
- ! '"Armpits," the Doctor agreed, stepping into an old bathtub as Olivia and Rory
  continued to examine the things around them.'
- ! '"What about all this stuff?"'
- ! '"Where did this come from?"'
- ! '"There''s a rift running through here," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"Stuff gets sucked through it.'
- There's one in Cardiff like that."
- ! '"Not a bubble!"'
- ! '"A plughole.'
- The universe is a plughole, and we've just fallen down it."
- ! '"Thief!'
- You're my thief!"
- ! '"She''s dangerous!'
- Guard yourself!"
- ! '"Look at you!'
- What's the other one?"
- ! '"The hell?!"'
- ! '"Welcome, strangers, lovely," the man greeted.'
- ! '"Sorry about the mad person."'
- ! '"Why am I a thief?"'
- ! '"What have I stolen?"'
- ! '"Me," the woman chirped.'
- ! '"You''re going to steal me.'
- Oh, tenses are difficult, aren't they?"
- ! '"Oh, oh, we are sorry, my dove," the older woman panted from running as the other
  woman examined Amy''s hair.'
- ! '"She''s off her head.'
- They call me Auntie."
- ! '"And I''m Uncle," the man introduced as they shook the Doctor''s hand.'
- ! '"I''m everybody''s uncle.'
- She bites!"
- ! '"Do I?'
- Excellent!"
- ! '"Ow!'
- Ow!"
- ! '"Biting is excellent!'
- It's like kissing, only there's a winner," the woman grinned.
- ! '"Sorry, she''s doolally," Uncle muttered.'
- ! '"No, I''m not doolally," she argued.'
- ! '"I''m…I''m… It''s on the tip of my tongue.'
- I've just had a new idea about kissing."
- ! '"No, you haven''t!"'
- ! '"Idris, no!"'
- ! '"Oh, but now you''re angry," Idris said, then added, "No, you''re not.'
- The little boxes will make you angry."
- ! '"Sorry?"'
- ! '"The little what?'
- Boxes?"
- Idris suddenly burst into laughter and reached up to grab the Doctor's chin, grinning,
  "Your chin is hilarious!"
- She looked to Rory as she let the Doctor's chin go and explained, "It means the
  smell of dust after rain."
- ! '"What does?"'
- ! '"Petrichor."'
- ! '"But I didn''t ask."'
- ! '"Not yet.'
- But you will."
- Idris looked to Olivia making her frown in warily at her before she told her, "He'll
  find out.
- He always finds out."
- ! '"Find out about what?"'
- ! '"The secret," Idris replied.'
- ! '"The deep, dark secret."'
- ! '"Olivia, what is she talking about?"'
- ! '"I have no idea," she replied, honestly, still staring at Idris in wonder.'
- ! '"No, no, Idris, you should have a rest," Auntie insisted.'
- ! '"Rest, yes, yes, good idea," Idris agreed.'
- ! '"I''ll just see if there''s an off switch."'
- ! '"Is that it?"'
- ! '"She''s dead now.'
- So sad."
- ! '"She''s still breathing," Rory reported, examining her as Olivia frowned at the
  disappointed look on Uncle''s face before he turned to someone else behind them.'
- ! '"Nephew, take Idris somewhere she cannot bite people," he requested as Olivia
  turned only to jump back and smack the Doctor''s arm to get his attention.'
- ! '"Ah!'
- What?"
- the Doctor blurted before turning and grinning, "Oh, hello!"
- ! '"Doctor, what is that?"'
- ! '"Oh, no, it''s alright," the Doctor assured them as Olivia frowned at its glowing
  green eyes.'
- ! '"It''s an Ood.'
- May I?"
- ! '"It might just be on the wrong frequency," the Doctor guessed as he worked on
  it and Olivia watched in awe.'
- ! '"Nephew was broken when he came here," Auntie explained.'
- ! '"Well, he was half dead.'
- House repaired all of us."
- ! '"What was that?"'
- ! '"Was that him?"'
- ! '"No, no," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"It''s picking up something else.'
- You alright?!"
- ! '"Fine," she groaned as he knelt in front of her and she was about to explain
  but he turned his attention to Auntie and Uncle, and she didn''t blame him…this
  time.'
- ! '"Who else is here?"'
- ! '"Tell me, show me.'
- Show me!"
- ! '"Just what you see," Auntie replied as Amy held Olivia back to her feet.'
- ! '"Just the four of us.'
- Will you take Idris somewhere safe, where she can't hurt nobody."
- ! '"The House, what''s the House?"'
- ! '"The House is all around you, my sweets," Auntie replied as Uncle jumped up and
  down.'
- ! '"You are standing on him.'
- Would you like to meet him?"
- ! '"Meet him?"'
- ! '"Doctor—"'
- ! '"I''d love to," the Doctor cut into Olivia''s call and Auntie and Uncle turned
  to lead the way into the makeshift house.'
- ! '"Doctor," Olivia called, coming up next to him with a frown of pain over her
  brow and he turned to her with a frown of his own.'
- ! '"The Rift?"'
- ! '"Too much at one time after too long," she explained of her sudden headache.'
- ! '"That was a telepathic assault."'
- ! '"Yes, I know," he nodded, taking her face in his hands to look into her eyes,
  examining her.'
- ! '"You''re feeling better now?'
- You want to wait in the TARDIS?"
- ! '"No, I''ll be fine," she replied with a weak smile.'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"What were those voices?"'
- ! '"Time Lords," the Doctor replied, his hands falling from Olivia''s face as she
  swallowed when he turned to Amy and Rory.'
- ! '"It''s not just the Corsair.'
- Somewhere close by there are lots and lots of…Time Lords."
- ! '"Come, come, come," Uncle urged, leading the Doctor toward the vent as he and
  Auntie stepped onto it.'
- ! '"You can see House and he can look at you…"'
- ! '"I see," the Doctor hummed, kneeling next to the vent, still holding Olivia''s
  hand as he stared down into it.'
- ! '"This asteroid is sentient."'
- ! '"We walk on its back, breathe its air, eat its food," Auntie explained.'
- ! '"Smell its armpits," Amy added.'
- ! '"And do my will."'
- ! '"You are most welcome, travelers," the voice said.'
- ! '"Is that the asteroid talking through them?"'
- ! '"Yes," the Doctor nodded before stepping away from Auntie and Uncle.'
- ! '"So you''re like a…sea urchin.'
- Big, squashy, oogly thing inside, that's you."
- ! '"That is correct, Time Lord," House replied.'
- ! '"Ah, so you''ve met Time Lords before."'
- ! '"Many travelers have come through the rift.'
- I repair them when they break."
- ! '"What does that even mean?"'
- ! '"So there are Time Lords here, then," the Doctor assumed.'
- ! '"Not anymore, but there have been many TARDISes on my back in days gone by."'
- ! '"Ah, well, there won''t be any more after us.'
- Last TARDIS."
- ! '"A pity.'
- Rest, feed if you will."
- ! '"We''re not actually gonna stay here, are we?"'
- ! '"Well, it seems like a friendly planet…literally," the Doctor smiled before asking,
  "Mind if we poke around a bit?"'
- ! '"You can look all you want.'
- Look."
- ! '"House loves you."'
- ! '"Come on, then, gang, we''re just going to…uh…see the sights."'
- ! '"So, as soon as the TARDIS is refueled, we go, yeah?"'
- ! '"No," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"There are Time Lords here.'
- They need me."
- ! '"You told me about your people and you told me what you did," Amy recalled.'
- ! '"Yes, yes, but if they''re like the Corsair, they''re good ones, and I can save
  them."'
- ! '"And then tell them you destroyed all the others?"'
- ! '"I can explain.'
- Tell them why I had to."
- ! '"You wanna be forgiven."'
- ! '"Don''t we all?"'
- ! '"What do you need from me?"'
- ! '"My screwdriver," he said.'
- ! '"I left it in the TARDIS.'
- It's in my jacket."
- ! '"You''re wearing your jacket," Rory pointed out.'
- ! '"My other jacket," the Doctor quickly replied.'
- ! '"You have two of those?"'
- ! '"Ok, I''ll get it," Amy cut in.'
- ! '"But, Doctor, listen to me.'
- Don't get emotional, because that's when you make mistakes."
- ! '"Yes, Boss," he smirked, giving her a salute.'
- ! '"Olivia, watch him, and I''ll call you from the TARDIS," Amy called as she walked
  away and Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Rory, look after them."'
- ! '"Rory, look after her," Olivia ordered, nodding toward Amy''s exit and he nodded
  in return before following Amy out and Olivia turned to the Doctor to take his arm,
  saying, "Quick question."'
- ! '"Yes, Liv?"'
- ! '"I can feel your screwdriver pressing against my arm."'
- ! '"Was that a question?"'
- ! '"No, my question is, why did you send them back to the TARDIS?"'
- ! '"Same reason I would''ve sent you, except I need you for this bit."'
- ! '"Hey, we''re here," Amy reported and Olivia placed the phone on speaker so that
  the Doctor could hear her.'
- ! '"The screwdriver''s in his jacket, yeah?"'
- ! '"Yeah, it''s around somewhere," the Doctor replied, pulling the Sonic out and
  holding it up.'
- ! '"Have a good look."'
- ! '"Locked and sealed in tight.'
- Right, now, Liv, give me your left hand."
- ! '"What are we doing?"'
- ! '"We''re finding those Time Lords," he explained, slipping his right arm around
  her waist and pulling her close, entwining the fingers of their left hands so that
  their wedding bands were touching.'
- ! '"Our Psychic link should help us out.'
- Just follow my lead."
- ! '"See, this is what I''m talking about," Olivia smiled, making him frown as he
  shuffled them forward and she rested her head on his shoulder.'
- ! '"Random, romantic, dancing.'
- You've been reading my notes, haven't you?"
- ! '"Maybe I have," he murmured with a smirk in her ear as they reached an open room
  and he stopped them, his smirk falling.'
- ! '"They''re close, I can feel it.'
- Concentrate."
- ! '"Well, they can''t all be in here," he reasoned.'
- ! '"Theta," Olivia breathed, making him frown at her but as she stepped closer,
  she only stared at the pair of small doors they were facing.'
- ! '"Just admiring your Time Lord distress signal collection," the Doctor muttered
  in anger.'
- ! '"Nice job, brilliant job.'
- But this is what the Ood translator picked up, cries for help from the long dead."
- ! '"How many Time Lords have you lured here, the way you lured me?'
- And what happened to them all?"
- ! '"House—House is kind and he is wise," Auntie tried.'
- ! '"House repairs you when you break!'
- But how does he mend you?"
- ! '"You''ve got the eyes of a twenty year old."'
- ! '"Thank you," Uncle replied.'
- ! '"No, no, I mean it literally.'
- Your eyes are thirty years younger than the rest of you."
- ! '"Your ears don''t match, your right arm is two inches longer than your left.'
- Because you've got two left feet."
- ! '"Patchwork people," Olivia shuddered.'
- ! '"You''ve been repaired and patched up so often, I doubt there''s anything left
  of what used to be you," the Doctor ground out before grabbing Auntie''s oversized
  arm.'
- ! '"I had an umbrella like you, once."'
- ! '"Oh, now, it''s been a great arm for me, this," Auntie reported, showing off
  a snake tattoo and making both the Doctor and Olivia stare at it with wide eyes
  before he released her.'
- ! '"He was a strapping big bloke, wasn''t he, Uncle?'
- I got the arm and Uncle got the spine and the kidneys."
- ! '"You gave me hope and then you took it away," the Doctor reported in a low tone,
  making Olivia grip his arm in warning to him.'
- ! '"That''s enough to make anyone dangerous.'
- God knows what it will do to me."
- ! '"Get out before it''s too late," Olivia warned them, but when they didn''t move,
  she shouted, "Run!"'
- ! '"Poor old Time Lord," Uncle said, backing away as Auntie simply ran away.'
- ! '"Too late.'
- House is too clever."
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"Give him the phone."'
- ! '"You''re in trouble," Olivia told the Doctor, hearing her tone before placing
  the phone on speaker again.'
- ! '"Go ahead."'
- ! '"No Sonic Screwdriver.'
- Rory thinks there's a perfectly innocent explanation, but I think you lied to us."
- ! '"Time Lord stuff.'
- Needed you out of the way," the Doctor replied.
- ! '"What, we''re not good enough for your smart, new friends?"'
- ! '"Amelia, don''t be like that," Olivia chided.'
- ! '"Oh, don''t scold me.'
- You're in on it, too."
- ! '"Just ''cause I''m married to him doesn''t mean I know what''s going through
  his head.'
- I never know what's going through his head."
- ! '"''The boxes will make you angry.'''
- How could she know?"
- ! '"Doctor, what are you talking about?"'
- ! '"Stay put.'
- Stay exactly where you are!"
- ! '"Don''t have much—!"'
- ! '"Where are we going?!"'
- ! '"To find the biting woman!"'
- ! '"Oh, wonderful!'
- You want to get a disease, don't you?!"
- ! '"How did you know about the boxes?!"'
- ! '"You said they''d make me angry.'
- How did you know?"
- ! '"Ah, it''s my thief," Idris realized in a soft voice as she sat in the cage,
  her eyes closed before she opened them to look at them.'
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"It''s about time," she smiled.'
- ! '"I don''t understand," the Doctor admitted asking her again, "Who are you?"'
- ! '"Do you really not know me just because they put me in here?"'
- ! '"They said you were dangerous," the Doctor recalled.'
- ! '"Not the cage, stupid," Idris retorted, shifting closer to a gap and pressing
  her fingers to her temples as she stared at him.'
- ! '"In here.'
- I'm the…" She stopped as if trying to think of the word, making the Doctor and Olivia
  both frown at her.
- ! '"Oh!'
- I go…"
- ! '"The TARDIS," she breathed through a grin.'
- ! '"Time And Relative Dimension In Space.'
- It's me," she told them, standing and gripping the hexagon bars.
- ! '"I''m the TARDIS."'
- ! '"No, you''re not!"'
- ! '"You''re a bitey madlady.'
- The TARDIS is up-and-downy stuff in a big, blue box."
- ! '"Yes, that''s me," Idris confirmed, leaning on the bars.'
- ! '"A Type 40 TARDIS.'
- And the first time you touched my console, you said—"
- ! '"I said you were the most beautiful thing I''d ever known," the Doctor finished
  as Olivia glanced between the two, now feeling like a third wheel.'
- ! '"And then you stole me.'
- And I stole you."
- ! '"I borrowed you."'
- ! '"Borrowing implies the eventual intention to return the thing that was taken.'
- What makes you think I would ever give you back?"
- ! '"You''re the TARDIS?"'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"My TARDIS?!"'
- ! '"My Doctor.'
- We have now reached the point in the conversation where you open the lock."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"You''re not angry," he realized, making her frown at him.'
- ! '"Why would I be angry?"'
- ! '"Well…she''s a girl."'
- ! '"She''s the TARDIS."'
- ! '"But…she''s a girl."'
- ! '"Just open the door!"'
- ! '"Are all people like this?"'
- ! '"Like what?"'
- ! '"So much bigger on the inside," Idris explained before looking to the Doctor
  again.'
- ! '"I''m…Oh, what is that word?!'
- It's so sad."
- ! '"Why pull the soul from a TARDIS and stick it in a human head?"'
- ! '"Why does it want you?"'
- ! '"Oh, it doesn''t want me," Idris replied before sniffing the Doctor.'
- ! '"How do you know?"'
- ! '"House eats TARDISes," she replied, fluffing Olivia''s hair around her shoulders
  before lifting her right wrist to look at the rubber band on it.'
- ! '"House what?!"'
- ! '"What do you mean?!"'
- ! '"I don''t know.'
- Something I heard you say," Idris replied, pulling the rubber band from Olivia's
  wrist and stepping behind her as Olivia's eyes shifted in confusion.
- ! '"When?"'
- ! '"In the future," Idris replied, pulling Olivia''s hair into a tight ponytail.'
- ! '"House eats TARDISes?"'
- ! '"Oh, there you go," Idris smiled, pressing her thumb to his mouth before looking
  back at Olivia, asking, "What are fish fingers?"'
- ! '"When do I say that?"'
- ! '"Any second."'
- ! '"Of course!'
- Mm, fish fingers."
- ! '"Do fish have fingers?"'
- ! '"But eating a TARDIS would destroy you," Olivia knew without being told.'
- ! '"Yes, unless—unless…" the Doctor trailed off.'
- ! '"Unless you deleted the TARDIS matrix first," Idris finished.'
- ! '"Whoa, so House deleted you?"'
- ! '"But House can''t just delete the TARDIS consciousness.'
- So he pulls out that matrix, sticks it into a living receptacle, and then feeds
  off the remaining Artron energy."
- Idris gasped before looking to the Doctor and continuing, "You were about to say
  all that.
- I don't suppose you have to now."
- ! '"Theta, Amy and Rory are in there," Olivia reminded him as she pulled out her
  phone and dialed Amy''s number.'
- ! '"They''ll be eaten," the Doctor realized, bolting down the hall as he took Olivia
  shot after him.'
- ! '"Amy!'
- Get out of there!"
- ! '"Something''s wrong!"'
- ! '"House is after the TARDIS!'
- Both of you get out!"
- ! '"We can''t!'
- He locked the door!"
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Unlock the door!"
- ! '"I have unlocked it!"'
- ! '"He says he''s unlocked it," Olivia reported into the phone.'
- ! '"He stupid well hasn''t!"'
- ! '"Olivia, I don''t like this!"'
- ! '"You and me both," Olivia replied when they reached the TARDIS.'
- ! '"We''re trying to get you out.'
- Hang on!"
- ! '"Open!"'
- ! '"Open this door!"'
- ! '"Amy!'
- Rory!"
- Olivia called, pounding on the door, but instead of opening, the TARDIS engines
  sounded, making her and the Doctor stare wide eyes at it as it disappeared and she
  shuddered, "Theta?"
- ! '"Mobile.'
- Try the mobile," he ordered, and she pressed the phone to her ear.
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"What are we gonna do?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," he murmured.'
- ! '"I really don''t know what to do."'
- He smiled, nervously, saying, "That's a new feeling."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"It''s gone," he reported to her as she sat next to the cage.'
- ! '"Eaten?"'
- ! '"No, it left," he replied, letting go of Olivia''s hand to pace as Auntie and
  Uncle hobbled in.'
- ! '"Not eaten.'
- But why?"
- ! '"It''s time for us both to go, Uncky, together," Auntie announced as Olivia swallowed,
  sighing as she sat next to Idris who watched her closely.'
- ! '"Whoa, whoa, whoa!'
- Where are you going?"
- ! '"Well, we''re dying, my love," Auntie replied casually as they sat.'
- ! '"It''s time for Auntie and Uncle to pop off."'
- ! '"I''m against it," Uncle shrugged.'
- ! '"It''s your fault, isn''t it, sweets?"'
- ! '"''Cause you told House that it was the last TARDIS.'
- House can't feed on them if there's none more coming, can he?"
- ! '"So now he''s off to your universe, to find more TARDISes," Uncle explained.'
- ! '"Doctor…" Olivia called, leaning forward on her knees as Idris took her ponytail
  gently in one hand, still watching her.'
- ! '"It won''t," the Doctor retorted to Uncle, ignoring Olivia''s call.'
- ! '"Oh, it''ll think of something," Auntie replied then fell over, dead.'
- ! '"Actually, I feel fine," he announced before falling over as well, dead.'
- ! '"Ah!'
- Not dead!"
- ! '"Doctor…" Olivia called again, her tone strained.'
- ! '"You can''t just die!"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Liv!"'
- ! '"It''s the rift," she explained in a raw voice as he placed his hand under her
  chin to lift her face and use his kerchief to wipe her mouth.'
- ! '"It''s way too powerful here.'
- It's gonna kill me if we stay too long."
- ! '"We need to go to where I landed, Doctor, quickly," Idris explained.'
- ! '"Why?!"'
- ! '"Because we are there in three minutes," Idris replied as she stood.'
- ! '"Olivia is sick!'
- She's so pale!"
- ! '"Gee, thanks for the compliments, dear," Olivia muttered, holding her stomach
  and silently praying she wouldn''t hurl again.'
- ! '"Oh, yes, I''m trying to take care of you, and you get snarky.'
- Lovely."
- ! '"We need to go…" Idris paused before resuming, "…now."'
- ! '"What''s wrong with her?"'
- ! '"Roughly how long do these bodies last?"'
- ! '"You''re dying," he breathed, making Olivia stare at them with wide eyes.'
- ! '"Yes, of course I''m dying," she retorted snatching his Sonic away.'
- ! '"I don''t belong in a flesh body.'
- Focus."
- ! '"On what?!"'
- ! '"How?!'
- Ooh…"
- ! '"Here we go," Olivia murmured, hearing the change in his tone.'
- ! '"No, I''m not," he smirked.'
- ! '"Not what?"'
- ! '"Because it''s not a junkyard.'
- It's not a junkyard."
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"It''s a TARDIS junkyard!"'
- he grinned, pulling her toward the exit but stopped in front of Idris to ask her,
  "Sorry, do you have a name?"
- ! '"Seven hundred years," Idris retorted.'
- ! '"Finally, he asks."'
- ! '"What do I call you?"'
- ! '"I think you call me…Sexy," she smirked, making Olivia slap her palm to her head
  as the Doctor glanced between the women.'
- ! '"Only when we''re alone," he murmured to Idris.'
- ! '"I''m gonna stick to calling you Idris," Olivia announced before turning toward
  the exit, still holding the Doctor''s hand and dragging him with her as he grabbed
  Idris'' hand to pull her with them.'
- ! '"Valley of half-eaten TARDISes," the Doctor named the wreckage before them.'
- ! '"Are either of you thinking what I''m thinking?"'
- ! '"I''m thinking all of my sisters are dead, that they were devoured, and that
  we are looking at their corpses," Idris replied.'
- ! '"Ah, sorry, no, I wasn''t thinking that," the Doctor admitted.'
- ! '"No.'
- You were thinking you could build a working TARDIS console out broken remnants of
  a hundred different models," Idris replied.
- ! '"And you don''t care that it''s impossible."'
- ! '"It''s not impossible as long as we''re alive," the Doctor argued.'
- ! '"Rory and Amy need us, so, yeah, we''re gonna build a TARDIS."'
- ! '"Yes," Idris replied when Olivia opened her mouth, making her frown and close
  it as Idris looked to her.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Yes, it''s the secret you''re thinking of."'
- ! '"Oh…"'
- ! '"No, I can''t tell you how or when, but he will find out."'
- ! '"But you know?"'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Will it…change things between us?"'
- ! '"No, of course, you can''t tell me."'
- ! '"Liv!"'
- ! '"I need your Sonic, love!"'
- ! '"Bond the tube directly into the tachyon diverter," Idris instructed as the Doctor
  dragged a huge piece of paneling toward their TARDIS console.'
- ! '"Yes, I have actually rebuilt a TARDIS before, you know!'
- I know what I'm doing!"
- ! '"No, Liv, go sit down.'
- Don't strain yourself."
- ! '"You''re like a nine year old trying to rebuild a motorbike in his bedroom and
  you never read the instructions," Idris retorted.'
- ! '"I always read the instructions!"'
- ! '"There''s a sign on my front door.'
- What does it say?"
- ! '"That''s not instructions!"'
- ! '"There''s an instruction at the bottom.'
- What does it say?"
- ! '"''Pull to open.''"'
- ! '"Yes, and what do you do?"'
- ! '"I push!"'
- ! '"Every single time.'
- Police box doors open out the way."
- ! '"I told you!"'
- ! '"Didn''t I tell you?!'
- I told you years ago!"
- ! '"Stay out of this, Liv!"'
- ! '"You know, I think I have earned the right to open my front doors any way I want!"'
- ! '"Your front doors?'
- Have you any idea how childish that sounds?"
- ! '"You are not my mother."'
- ! '"And you are not my child."'
- ! '"You know, since we''re talking, with mouths, not really an opportunity that
  comes along very often, I just wanna say, you know, you have never been very reliable."'
- ! '"And you have?"'
- ! '"You didn''t always take me where I wanted to go."'
- ! '"No, but I always took you where you needed to go."'
- ! '"You did," the Doctor realized before ginning.'
- ! '"Look at us, talking!'
- Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the
  box?"
- ! '"You know I''m not constructed that way.'
- I exist across all space and time and you talk and run around and bring home strays!"
- ! '"Hey!"'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"One of the kidneys has already failed," Idris reported.'
- ! '"It doesn''t matter.'
- We need to finish assembling the console."
- ! '"Using a console without a proper shell…it''s not gonna be safe," the Doctor
  realized as Olivia scanned Idris with her Sonic and quickly looked to the results.'
- ! '"Theta, she''s got eighteen minutes," she reported.'
- ! '"The universe we''re in will reach absolute zero in three hours," Idris reported.'
- ! '"Safe is relative."'
- The Doctor exchanged a glance with Olivia before turning to grab the ropes he'd
  tossed away, saying, "Then we need to get a move on, eh, old girl?
- Liv, stay with her."
- ! '"I''m sure you know what I''m gonna ask you, but I wanna ask anyway," she said
  as Idris still worked.'
- ! '"Do the Doctor and I…ever…?"'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Thank you for telling me."'
- ! '"You needed the hope."'
- ! '"You''ll need to install the time rotor!"'
- ! '"How is this thing gonna make it through the rift?"'
- ! '"Don''t worry, it will," the Doctor assured her as he lowered the glass column
  he was carrying into the center on the console.'
- ! '"Almost done.'
- Rust diffuser?"
- ! '"Check!"'
- ! '"Retro scope?"'
- ! '"Check."'
- ! '"Blue…thingy?"'
- ! '"Check…dork."'
- ! '"Oi, you married me."'
- ! '"Yes I did."'
- ! '"Do you ever wonder why I chose you all those years ago?"'
- ! '"I chose you," the Doctor corrected, still working.'
- ! '"You were unlocked."'
- ! '"Of course I was," Idris retorted, turning to step toward the console.'
- ! '"I wanted to see the universe, so I stole a Time Lord and I ran away.'
- And you were the only one mad enough."
- ! '"Sounds about right," Olivia nodded with a smirk as she and the Doctor stepped
  toward her to look at their work.'
- ! '"Right, perfect," the Doctor grinned.'
- ! '"Look at that.'
- What could possibly go wrong?"
- ! '"Oh, don''t say that," Olivia chided, smacking his arm lightly before something
  popped off the console.'
- ! '"See?!"'
- ! '"That''s fine.'
- That always happens."
- ! '"Oh, yes, I often see parts pop off the console in your TARDIS."'
- ! '"No, hang on, wait!"'
- They hooked up the cords before taking positions around the console as he began,
  "Right, ok, let's go.
- Follow that TARDIS."
- ! '"There''s rift energy everywhere," the Doctor complained working something on
  the console.'
- ! '"You can do it.'
- Let's be having ya!"
- ! '"What''s wrong with it?"'
- ! '"It can''t hold a charge.'
- I've got nothing."
- ! '"You idiot," Olivia smirked, drawing his gaze to her.'
- ! '"You have everything you need right here."'
- ! '"You''ve got me," Idris smiled in agreement, kissing a finger and her eyes glowed
  gold as she reached out and gave energy to the console, making it jostle to life
  before disappearing from the asteroid''s surface.'
- ! '"We''re locked on!"'
- ! '"They''ll have to lower the shields when we''re close enough to phase inside!"'
- ! '"Can you get a message to Amy?!"'
- ! '"The telepathic circuits are online!"'
- ! '"Which one''s Amy?!"'
- ! '"The pretty one?!"'
- ! '"Sure!"'
- ! '"Liv!'
- Be careful!"
- ! '"If you''re thrown off the edge—!"'
- ! '"I know!"'
- ! '"I''m dead!"'
- ! '"Hello, Pretty," Idris began, talking into the mirror and Olivia hurried up next
  to Idris to speak into the mirror.'
- ! '"What the hell is that?"'
- ! '"It''s ok!"'
- ! '"Telepathic messaging.'
- That's Rory, not Amy."
- ! '"You have to go to the old control room," Idris explained to Rory.'
- ! '"I''m putting the route in your head.'
- When you get there, use the purple slider on the nearest panel to lower the shields."
- ! '"The pretty one?!"'
- ! '"You''ll have about twelve seconds before the room goes into phase with the invading
  matrix.'
- Good luck."
- ! '"How''re they gonna get the shields down?!"'
- ! '"House will be in the control room!"'
- ! '"I directed him to one of the old control rooms!"'
- ! '"There aren''t any old control rooms!"'
- ! '"They were all deleted or remodeled!"'
- ! '"I archived them for neatness!'
- I've got about thirty now."
- ! '"But I''ve only changed the desktop, what, a dozen times?!"'
- ! '"So far, yeah!"'
- ! '"You can''t archive something that hasn''t happened yet!"'
- ! '"You can''t!"'
- ! '"Keep going!"'
- ! '"You''re doing it, you sexy thing!"'
- ! '"See you do call me that!"'
- ! '"Is it my name?!"'
- ! '"You bet it''s your name!"'
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"I''ve got you!'
- Come on!"
- ! '"Grab onto the console and don''t let go!"'
- ! '"They did it!"'
- ! '"Shields down!"'
- ! '"There it is!"'
- ! '"It''s not going to hold!"'
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Olivia!"
- ! '"Not good," Idris gasped as Olivia helped her up.'
- ! '"Not good at all.'
- How do you walk around in these things?"
- ! '"We''re not quite there yet, just hold on," the Doctor told her before looking
  back to Amy and Rory, saying, "Uh, Amy, this is…well, she''s my TARDIS.'
- She's a woman and she's my TARDIS."
- ! '"She''s the TARDIS?!"'
- ! '"And she''s a woman.'
- She's a woman and he's the TARDIS."
- ! '"Did you wish really hard?"'
- ! '"Shut up!"'
- ! '"Not like that.'
- Stop laughing!"
- ! '"Hello," Idris panted.'
- ! '"I''m…Sexy."'
- ! '"Still, shut up," he warned her.'
- ! '"The environment has been breached," a familiar voice rang through the room,
  ceasing Olivia''s laughter and making all of them freeze.'
- ! '"Nephew, kill them all."'
- Their eyes shot around in terror before Rory questioned, "Where's Nephew?"
- ! '"He was standing right where you materialized," Amy reported.'
- ! '"Ah, well, he must''ve been redistributed," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Meaning what?"'
- ! '"We''re breathing him," Olivia blanched, making the others give disgusted faces.'
- ! '"Another Ood I failed to save," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"Doctor, I did not expect you," House confessed, cordially.'
- ! '"Well, that''s me all over, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"Lovely, old, unexpected me."'
- ! '"The big question is, now you''re here, how to dispose of you.'
- I could play with gravity…"
- ! '"Or I could evacuate the air from this room and watch you choke."'
- ! '"You really don''t wanna do that!"'
- ! '"Why shouldn''t I just kill you now?"'
- ! '"Because then I won''t be able to help you," the Doctor panted, making Olivia
  whip a wide-eyed gaze of disbelief at him.'
- ! '"Listen to your engines.'
- Just promise."
- ! '"You can''t be serious!"'
- ! '"I''m very serious," he replied.'
- ! '"I''m sure it''s an entity of its word."'
- ! '"Doctor, she''s burning up," Rory reported, making the three look to him and
  the Doctor ran toward Idris.'
- ! '"She''s asking for water."'
- ! '"Hang in there, Old Girl," he murmured.'
- ! '"Not long now.'
- It'll be over soon."
- ! '"I always liked it when you called me Old Girl," she replied in a weak voice
  before the Doctor looked to Olivia over his shoulder as she stood behind him.'
- ! '"Look after her," he ordered and she nodded before switching places with him.'
- ! '"You want me to give my word?'
- I promise."
- ! '"Fine, ok," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"I trust you."'
- ! '"I don''t," Olivia ground out, making him meet her eyes with a warning gaze.'
- ! '"Just delete thirty percent of the TARDIS rooms.'
- Activate subroutine Sigma Nine."
- ! '"Why would you tell me this?"'
- ! '"Because we wanna get back to out universe as badly as you do…and I''m nice."'
- ! '"Yes.'
- Very helpful."
- ! '"Oh…" Olivia breathed in realization, making Rory frown at her.'
- ! '"Oh, what?"'
- ! '"He''s a genius," she whispered.'
- ! '"Goodbye, Time Lord.'
- Goodbye, Idris."
- ! '"Yes, I mean you could do that, but it just won''t work," the Doctor began, pacing
  around the console.'
- ! '"Fail safe, hardwired into the TARDIS," Olivia grinned, standing to step toward
  the console.'
- ! '"Any living thing in a room that''s deleted get automatically dropped in here…the
  main control room."'
- ! '"But thanks for the lift!"'
- ! '"We are in your universe now, Doctor.'
- I've killed hundreds of Time Lords."
- ! '"Fear me," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"I''ve killed all of them."'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Yeah," he continued.'
- ! '"You''re right, you''ve completely won!'
- But before you do kill us, allow me and my friends to congratulate you on being
  an absolutely worthy opponent."
- ! '"Congratulations?"'
- ! '"Yep, you''ve defeated us, me and my lovely friends here," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"And last, but definitely not least, the TARDIS matrix herself, a living consciousness
  you ripped out of this very control room and locked up into a human body!'
- And look at her."
- ! '"Doctor, she''s stopped breathing," Rory reported, making Amy kneel next to him
  as Olivia shot her gaze to Idris'' body before looking back at the Doctor.'
- ! '"Enough.'
- That is enough."
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"It''s never enough!'
- Look at her body, House."
- ! '"And, you think I should mourn her?"'
- ! '"No.'
- I think you should be very, very careful about what you let back into this control
  room."
- ! '"You took her from her home, but now she''s back in the box again she''s free."'
- ! '"Look at my girl," the Doctor grinned, admirably.'
- ! '"Look at her go.'
- Finish him off, girl."
- ! '"Doctor," Idris called, making him turn.'
- ! '"Are you there?'
- It's so very dark in here."
- ! '"I''m here," he smiled, stepping closer to her as she looked to him.'
- ! '"Hey."'
- ! '"I''ve been looking for a word.'
- I found it now."
- ! '"What word?"'
- ! '"Alive.'
- I'm alive."
- ! '"Alive isn''t sad."'
- ! '"It''s sad when it''s over.'
- There's something I didn't get to say to you."
- ! '"Goodbye," the Doctor guessed in a murmur, tears in his eyes as he swallowed.'
- ! '"No.'
- It's so very, very nice to meet you."
- ! '"Please," he shuddered.'
- ! '"I don''t want you to."'
- Her body became brighter as the engines sounded and she disappeared with a final
  whisper of, "I love you."
- ! '"How''s it going down there?"'
- ! '"Yeah, just putting a firewall around the matrix!"'
- ! '"Almost done."'
- ! '"Are you gonna make her talk again?"'
- ! '"Can''t," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Spacey-wacey, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"Well, actually, it''s because the Time Lords discovered that if you take an
  eleventh dimensional matrix and fold it into a mechanical, then—"'
- ! '"Spacey-wacey," Olivia confirmed, grabbing Rory''s sleeve and dragging him back
  toward the stairs where she sat.'
- ! '"Sorry," Rory blurted, then added, "At the end, she was talking.'
- I don't know what it meant."
- ! '"What did she say?"'
- ! '"The only water in the forest is the river," Rory recited.'
- ! '"She said we''d need to know that someday.'
- It doesn't make sense, does it?"
- ! '"Not yet," Olivia smirked, making him look to her with a slight smile before
  she tapped his arm in a friendly gesture, asking, "You alright?"'
- ! '"No," he admitted, drawing the Doctor''s attention to them as well as Amy came
  down the stairs to meet them.'
- ! '"I watched her die.'
- I'm a nurse."
- ! '"Letting it get to you," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"You know what that''s called?'
- The Eye of Orion's restful."
- ! '"If you like restful," Olivia smirked, knowingly.'
- ! '"I could never really get the hang of restful," the Doctor admitted, looking
  to the circuits of the TARDIS and asking, "What do you think, dear, huh?'
- Where should we take the kids this time?"
- ! '"Look at you pair," Amy chuckled.'
- ! '"It''s always you and her, isn''t it?'
- A boy and his box, off to see the universe."
- ! '"Well, you say that as if it''s a bad thing," the Doctor noticed, wiping something
  down with a yellow handkerchief.'
- ! '"But, honestly, it''s the best thing there is.'
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
- ! '"Ok, um, Doctor," Amy called.'
- ! '"This time, could we lose the bunk beds?"'
- ! '"No!'
- You can't beat that."
- ! '"It''s your room.'
- Off you pop."
- ! '"Doctor, do you have a room?"'
- ! '"You''re quiet again," he noticed, not looking at her.'
- ! '"We can have bunk beds in our room, if you want," she smiled, sweetly.'
- ! '"Cheers!"'
- ! '"Thinking again?"'
- ! '"Not really.'
- Just watching you work."
- He turned back to his work and they were silent for a moment before she said, "Amy's
  right, isn't she?
- It'll always be you and her."
- ! '"Don''t be jealous, Liv."'
- ! '"I''m not jealous," she sighed in exasperation.'
- ! '"Why do you think I''m jealous?"'
- ! '"Well, considering your track record with the women in my life, I''d think jealous
  is a good guess."'
- ! '"I have no right to be jealous of this one.'
- She was here way before me."
- ! '"She likes you, Liv," he assured her.'
- ! '"She liked you the moment you boarded."'
- ! '"I remember," Olivia smiled as he carefully stood from the swing and headed toward
  the stairs, taking Olivia''s hand to pull her with him toward the console.'
- ! '"Fixed?"'
- ! '"Fixed," he answered, using the Sonic on the console before leaning on it, Olivia
  stepping to the other side, waiting for his instructions, but he whispered to the
  console, "Are you there?'
- No, I'm a silly old…"
- ! '"Ok," he sighed.'
- ! '"The Eye of Orion, or wherever we need to go."'
- ! '"Someone''s in a better mood!"'
- ! '"Of course, I am!"'
- ! '"Everything''s sorted!'
- Both of my sexy girls are back in the box and by my side where they belong!"
- ! '"Our Doctor," Olivia smiled before giggling in delight when he dipped her back
  before pulling her upright and hugging her close, still grinning.'
- ! '"My girls."'
- ! '"Where are you taking me?"'
- ! '"Our room," he announced, opening the door and pulling her inside.'
- ! '"What do you think?"'
- ! '"I love it!"'
- ! '"I call top bunk!"'
- ! '"You''re such a little boy!"'
- ! '"I need a shower.'
- Almost."
- ! '"Ah!'
- Liv!"
- He lifted a hand and leaned his forearm on the frame, standing over her as he crossed
  one ankle over the other and placed a hand on his hip, showing off his suspenders
  and smirking, "Why don't we…have a shower together, eh?"
- ! '"Oh, sweetie, I wanna come out of this shower feeling clean, not dirty," she
  smirked, stepping closer to press a kiss to his cheek and whispered, "But if you
  wanna give up the top bunk for the night, I can make it up to you."'
- ! '"But…top bunk," he muttered with a slight pout, making her smile, slyly.'
- ! '"Oh, well," she shrugged casually, turning to head into the bathroom and shutting
  the door behind her, leaving the Doctor staring at the door in thought.'
- ! '"Changed your mind, did you?"'
- ! '"I''m going to ask you a question, Mrs.'
- Sigma, and you are not allowed to be cross," he told her, making her lift a brow
  at him as she sat up straight.
- ! '"Well, that depends on the question, Mr.'
- Sigma," she retorted, resuming in drying her hair with the towel.
- ! '"What secret was she talking about?"'
- ! '"Is it the one I''m not supposed to ask you about?"'
- ! '"No…" she breathed, her eyes shifting over his face before she stood to head
  toward her dresser.'
- ! '"But it may as well be.'
- Don't ask me about it again, Theta."
- ! '"Liv—"'
- ! '"Please," she cut him off in a desperate tone as he swung his legs off the mattress,
  facing her as he froze on the bed.'
- ! '"You heard her yourself, you''ll find out eventually, and when you do, everything
  will change.'
- You'll hate me forever, and you'll leave me back with my mother, in tears."
- ! '"I could never hate you, Liv," he murmured.'
- ! '"No matter what it is, we''ll get through it together, and I won''t leave you.'
- I love you."
- ! '"I love you, too," she sighed, resting her cheek against his, aligning her arms
  with his to hold his hands in front of her.'
- ! '"Come to bed," he whispered, hugging her before gripping one of her hands and
  turning to pull her with him toward the bed.'
- ! '"You''re only gonna get the same result from that scanner," she murmured to him
  as he still stared at the scan for Amy''s pregnancy, which was still switching between
  positive and negative.'
- ! '"I know," he replied in a low tone.'
- ! '"Then why do you keep scanning her?"'
- ! '"Thing," he replied.'
- ! '"Clever thing.'
- Just follow my lead, Liv."
- ! '"When do I ever do anything else?"'
- ! '"Who want fish and chips?"'
- ! '"I''ll drop you both off.'
- But remember to bring some back for us."
- ! '"Uh, and you two?"'
- ! '"We have things to do, things involving…other things," the Doctor replied, making
  Olivia frown at him in confusion.'
- ! '"Well, we''ll stay with you," Amy objected.'
- ! '"We''ll do the other things."'
- ! '"Nope," the Doctor chirped, hitting something on the console as Amy and Rory
  came up the stairs and she narrowed her gaze at him.'
- ! '"Whatever you''re up to, I personally, would like to be a part of it," Amy told
  him, but when the Doctor only stared at her and Olivia remained silent, chewing
  her lower lip nervously, Amy glanced between them, questioning, "What?"'
- ! '"Solar tsunami!"'
- ! '"It''s come directly from the sun!'
- Huge tidal wave of radiation!"
- ! '"Oh, Doctor, my tummy''s going funny!"'
- ! '"Well, the gyros are dissipated!"'
- ! '"Target tracking is out!"'
- He shoved another lever up on the console before grabbing Olivia's hand, calling,
  "Assume the position!"
- ! '"What was that?!"'
- ! '"The position," he shrugged.'
- ! '"If we were gonna crash and die, wouldn''t you want to go out that way?'
- Anyway it doesn't matter because that was a textbook landing."
- ! '"Oh, yes, that was perfect," Olivia retorted.'
- ! '"Where are we?"'
- ! '"I dunno.'
- Let's find out!"
- the Doctor replied, grabbing Olivia's hand and pulling her toward the door to open
  it and announce, "Behold!
- And underneath, a monastery, thirteenth century."
- ! '"Doesn''t feel like the thirteenth century to me," Olivia replied, looking up
  at the huge stone building they were standing at the base of.'
- ! '"Oh, we''ve gone all medieval," Amy noticed, shutting the TARDIS door.'
- ! '"I''m not sure about that," Rory replied as the Doctor stepped away toward a
  fissure in the ground, Olivia following.'
- ! '"Really?"'
- ! '"Medieval expert, are you?"'
- ! '"No, it''s just that I can hear Dusty Springfield."'
- ! '"These fissures are new," the Doctor explained as Olivia stepped next to him,
  Amy and Rory catching up to them.'
- ! '"The Solar Tsunami will have sent a massive wave of gamma particles," Olivia
  reported.'
- ! '"So these were caused by a magnetic earthquake that most likely occurred before
  the wave hit."'
- ! '"Ooh, Liv," the Doctor hummed through a smirk, standing tall next to her and
  reaching into his pocket.'
- ! '"I love it when you go all clever."'
- ! '"Not just a pretty face," she smirked back, then frowned when he pulled a small
  snow globe from his pocket to shake it, examine it, then tuck it back into his pocket.'
- ! '"And this is right up my alley as in astrophysicist.'
- What's with the snow globe?"
- ! '"Clever thing," he replied.'
- ! '"Well, the monastery''s still standing," Amy observed.'
- ! '"Yeah, for now," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Doctor, look," Rory called, pointing to the pipe as Olivia pulled her Sonic
  from her jacket pocket.'
- ! '"Ah, it''s a supply pipe," he replied, both he and Olivia using their Sonic''s
  on it before looking to them for the results.'
- ! '"Ceramic inner lining."'
- ! '"Definitely something corrosive," Olivia reported.'
- ! '"They''re pumping something nasty off this island to the mainland," the Doctor
  observed.'
- ! '"My mum''s a massive fan of Dusty Springfield," Rory mused as the distant music
  still played.'
- ! '"Who isn''t?"'
- ! '"Right, let''s go!'
- Satisfy our rabid curiosity."
- ! '"So, where are these Dusty Springfield-loving monks, then?"'
- ! '"I think we''re here," the Doctor blurted, using his Sonic as he passed stone
  walls.'
- ! '"This is it."'
- ! '"Doctor, what are you talking about?"'
- ! '"We''ve never been here before."'
- ! '"We came here be accident," Amy recalled.'
- ! '"Accident?"'
- ! '"Yes, I know.'
- Accident."
- ! '"You''re being confusing again," Olivia whispered to him as Rory reached for
  something and burned himself on it, making him shout in pain and pull his hand back.'
- ! '"Acid," the Doctor blurted as Amy took Rory''s hand to examine it.'
- ! '"They''re pumping acid off this island.'
- Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger."
- They all jumped when an alarm suddenly blared, calling, "Intruder alert."
- ! '"There are people coming," the Doctor told them, calmly.'
- ! '"Well, almost."'
- ! '"Almost coming?"'
- ! '"Almost people," he corrected, making them frown at him before he grabbed Olivia''s
  hand to drag her through the monastery, Amy following them.'
- ! '"I think we should probably…probably go," Rory suggested.'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"I am telling you, when something runs toward you, it''s never for a nice reason!"'
- ! '"What are all these harnesses for?"'
- ! '"The Almost People?"'
- ! '"Are they prisoners, or what?"'
- ! '"Well, at the moment they fall into the ''Or What'' category," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Halt and remain calm," the PA system announced.'
- ! '"Well, we''re halted," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Everybody feeling calm?'
- ! '''Cause I''m not."'
- ! '"Don''t move!"'
- ! '"Stay back, Jen," the other man told the woman with them, also pointing a weapon
  at the four.'
- ! '"We don''t know who they are."'
- ! '"So let''s ask them," the woman, Jennifer, replied.'
- ! '"Who the hell are you?"'
- ! '"Well, I''m the Doctor and this is Olivia, Amy and Rory, and it''s all very nice,
  isn''t it?"'
- ! '"Uh, hang on," Olivia cut in.'
- ! '"They have the same faces."'
- ! '"What are you all, like identical twins?"'
- ! '"This is an Alpha grade industrial facility," another woman called, coming into
  the other exit with another man, both in suits that reminded Olivia of a Sontaran
  suit, but in brown.'
- ! '"Unless you work for the military or for Morpeth Jetsan, you are in big trouble."'
- ! '"Actually, you''re in big trouble," the Doctor retorted, pulling out his Psychic
  Paper and holding it toward her.'
- ! '"Meteorological department?"'
- ! '"Since when?"'
- ! '"Since you were hit by a solar wave," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Which we survived," Cleaves retorted.'
- ! '"Just barely," Olivia shot back.'
- ! '"There''s a bigger one on its way."'
- ! '"Which we''ll also survive," Cleaves assured them, then ordered the man in a
  suit like hers, "Dicken, scan for bugs."'
- ! '"Backs against the wall," the Scotsman ordered them.'
- ! '"Now."'
- ! '"You''re not a monastery," the Doctor realized.'
- ! '"You''re a factory.'
- Twenty-second century, army-owned factory."
- ! '"You''re army?"'
- ! '"No, love, we''re contractors," Cleaves explained.'
- ! '"And you''re trespassers."'
- ! '"It''s ok, boss," Dicken reported, stepping back from the four.'
- ! '"Alright, weatherman, your ID checks out," Cleaves assured him as he stepped
  toward her again.'
- ! '"If there''s another solar storm, what ya gonna do about it?'
- Hand out sunblock?"
- The Doctor laughed, taking his Psychic Paper back before asking, "I need to see
  you're critical systems."
- ! '"Which one?"'
- ! '"You know which one," the Doctor retorted, making Olivia frown up at him but
  she remained silent.'
- ! '"This way," Cleaves told them, leading the four though the hallway she and Dicken
  had come from, Jennifer, Buzzer and Jimmy following Amy and Rory as the Doctor held
  tightly to Olivia''s hand.'
- ! '"And there you are," he murmured.'
- ! '"What the hell is that?"'
- ! '"Meet the government''s worst-kept secret," Cleaves replied.'
- ! '"The Flesh.'
- In fact, it's even learning to replicate itself at the cellular level."
- ! '"Right.'
- Brilliant," Amy nodded then admitted.
- ! '"Lost."'
- ! '"Ok," Cleaves drawled, frowning at her.'
- ! '"Once a reading''s been taken, we can manipulate its molecular structure into
  anything, replicate a living organism.'
- Eyes, voice…"
- ! '"Mind, soul," the Doctor finished when she trailed off.'
- ! '"Don''t be fooled, Doctor," Cleaves shot back.'
- ! '"It acts like life, but it stills needs to be controlled by us from those harnesses
  you saw."'
- ! '"Wait, whoa, hold it," Rory called, drawing everyone''s attention to him.'
- ! '"So…you''re Flesh now?"'
- ! '"I''m lying in a harness back in that chamber," Cleaves explained.'
- ! '"We all are, except Jennifer, here.'
- Just like operating a forklift truck."
- ! '"You said it grows," Olivia recalled, drawing Cleaves'' attention to her.'
- ! '"Living things grow."'
- ! '"Moss grows," Cleaves replied.'
- ! '"It''s no more than that."'
- ! '"Right," Olivia nodded then, mockingly added, "Because even moss is lifeless."'
- ! '"This acid is dangerous," Cleaves retorted.'
- ! '"We were losing a worker every week.'
- If these bodies get burnt or fall in the acid—"
- ! '"Then who the hell cares, right, Jen?"'
- ! '"Well, the nerve endings automatically cut off," Jennifer explained.'
- ! '"Like airbags being discharged.'
- Except we wake up and get a new Ganger."
- ! '"It''s weird," Jimmy admitted.'
- ! '"But you get used to it."'
- ! '"Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger," Cleaves ordered.'
- ! '"Get back to the harness."'
- ! '"Hang on," Jimmy called.'
- ! '"What''s he up to?'
- What are you up to, pal?"
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"Stop it," he snapped before pulling the Sonic back as Olivia ran around the
  tub to stand next to him.'
- ! '"Strange.'
- It was like, for a moment there, it was scanning me."
- ! '"Doctor," Cleaves called in warning before it bubbled in agitation.'
- ! '"Get back, Doctor.'
- Leave it alone!"
- ! '"I understand," he blurted, staring at the Flesh.'
- ! '"Doctor, are you alright?"'
- ! '"Incredible," the Doctor breathed, looking around at them.'
- ! '"You have no idea.'
- I reached out to it and it to me."
- ! '"Don''t fiddle with the money, Doctor," Cleaves suggested, sardonically.'
- ! '"How can you be so blinkered?"'
- ! '"It''s alive.'
- You're piling your lives, your personalities, directly into it."
- ! '"It''s the solar storm," Olivia reported.'
- ! '"The first waves come in pairs: Preshock and full shock.'
- It's close."
- ! '"Buzz, have we got anything from the mainland yet?"'
- ! '"No," he replied.'
- ! '"The coms are still too jammed with radiation."'
- ! '"Ok, then we keep pumping acid until the mainland says stop," Cleaves reasoned,
  looking to the Doctor and Olivia.'
- ! '"Now why don''t you stand back and let us impress you."'
- ! '"Well, I see why you keep it in a church," the Doctor blurted.'
- ! '"The miracle of life."'
- ! '"No need to get poncey," Buzzer retorted.'
- ! '"It''s just gunge."'
- ! '"Guys, we need to get to work," Cleaves ordered them all as Jimmy and Buzzer
  helped Jennifer out of the tub.'
- ! '"Ok, everybody.'
- Let's crack on," Jimmy sighed before thunder clashed overhead again.
- ! '"Uh, does anybody remember there''s a solar storm on?"'
- ! '"You guys need to get out of here!"'
- ! '"Well, where do you want us to go?"'
- ! '"We''re on a tiny island."'
- ! '"Well, I can get you all off it," the Doctor assured them.'
- ! '"Don''t be ridiculous," Cleaves shot back.'
- ! '"We''ve got a job to do."'
- ! '"It''s coming," the Doctor replied, looking at his snow globe, making Olivia
  frown at him again before an alarm blared.'
- ! '"That''s the alarm," Jennifer reported.'
- ! '"How do you get power?"'
- ! '"We''re solar, and we use a solar router," Cleaves replied.'
- ! '"The weather vane."'
- ! '"And, that''s a problem," Olivia muttered then asked the Doctor, "Seriously,
  what''s with the snow globe?"'
- ! '"Told you.'
- Clever thing," he replied again.
- ! '"Follow my lead, remember?"'
- ! '"I know, but—"'
- ! '"Follow, Liv.'
- Follow."
- ! '"Boss," Jimmy called.'
- ! '"Maybe if the storm comes back we should get underground.'
- The acid pipes might not withstand another hit."
- ! '"We have two hundred tons of acid to pump out," Cleaves reminded him.'
- ! '"We fall behind, we stay another rotation.'
- Anyone want that?"
- The Doctor leaned over to grab Cleaves' arm to drag her away from them to speak
  to her, growling, "Please.
- If you don't…if you don't prepare for this storm, you are all in terrible danger,
  understand?"
- ! '"My factory, my rules," Cleaves replied, pulling her arm from his grip and stepping
  back toward the group.'
- ! '"Blimey!"'
- ! '"I never thought I''d see the day when I''d meet someone more stubborn than you,
  Liv."'
- ! '"Nice to know the universe still surprises you," she smirked.'
- ! '"I need to check the progress of the storm," he told them.'
- ! '"Monitoring station."'
- ! '"Three lefts, a right, and a left.'
- Third door on your left," she finally replied.
- ! '"Thank you."'
- ! '"The wave is disturbing the Earth''s magnetic field!"'
- ! '"There''s gonna be a whopper of a power surge!"'
- ! '"You see this weather vane, the cock-a-doodle-doo?"'
- ! '"It''s a solar router, feeding the whole factory with solar power.'
- I've got to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose."
- He ran back toward the stairs, Olivia right behind him before he turned to them
  and grinned, "I never thought I'd have to say that again.
- Amy, breathe."
- ! '"What are we gonna do?!"'
- ! '"You''re staying here, I''m going up there!"'
- ! '"Then you''re gonna need this…!"'
- ! '"For luck!"'
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"Are you ok?!'
- Wake up!"
- ! '"Olivia…"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Wake up!"'
- ! '"Liv, are you alright?"'
- ! '"My head," she groaned as he helped her slowly sit up and she rubbed the bump
  forming in her hair.'
- ! '"Something hit my head really hard."'
- ! '"That''ll be the door of the panel I was working on," he told her, glancing to
  it where it sat a foot or so away from them as he reached into the pocket of his
  jacket.'
- ! '"Here, take this.'
- One of the magic pills you like."
- ! '"Come on.'
- On your feet, darling," he urged, pulling her to her feet then lifting his hands
  to take her face into them and look into her eyes.
- ! '"No concussion.'
- Now let's go find the others."
- ! '"Cleaves!"'
- ! '"You''re not in your harness!"'
- ! '"I''m sorry, Doctor," she replied when they met her.'
- ! '"You were right."'
- ! '"You''ve lost all power to the factory," he reported.'
- ! '"Doctor, I abandoned my team," Cleaves murmured, making Olivia frown in wonder
  at her.'
- ! '"Then let''s go get them," the Doctor told Cleaves, still holding Olivia''s hand
  and heading from the courtyard and into the building.'
- ! '"How long would you say we were unconscious for, Cleaves?"'
- ! '"Not long," she replied as they made their way down a hallway.'
- ! '"A minute, two minutes."'
- ! '"I''d hazard we''ve been out a teensy bit longer," he objected.'
- ! '"How long?"'
- ! '"An hour," he replied, making her eyes widen at him.'
- ! '"I''ve seen whole worlds turn inside out in an hour.'
- A lot can go wrong in an hour."
- ! '"Doctor," Amy called as they entered.'
- ! '"These are all real people, so where are their Gangers?"'
- ! '"Don''t worry, when the link shuts down, the Gangers return to pure Flesh," Cleaves
  explained.'
- ! '"Now the storm''s left us with acid leaks all over, so we need to contact the
  mainland.'
- They can have a rescue shuttle out here in no time."
- ! '"Dusty Springfield," Olivia recognized.'
- ! '"That''s what was playing when we got here."'
- ! '"That''s my record," Jimmy explained.'
- ! '"Who''s playing my record?"'
- ! '"Your Gangers," the Doctor replied, shooting everyone''s gaze to him.'
- ! '"They''ve gone Walkabout."'
- ! '"No, it''s impossible," Cleaves objected.'
- ! '"Clearly, it not," Olivia shot back.'
- ! '"They''re not active.'
- Cars don't fly themselves, cranes don't lift themselves and Gangers don't—"
- ! '"No way," Buzzer muttered, seeing their things had been strewn about the room.'
- ! '"I don''t…I-I don''t believe this," Cleaves sputtered.'
- ! '"They could''ve escaped through the service door at the back," Jimmy reported,
  sending Buzzer and Amy to head toward it to have a look.'
- ! '"This is just like the Isle of Sheppey," Buzzer mused.'
- ! '"It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers," the Doctor explained as
  he sat at the head of the table, facing everyone.'
- ! '"They''ve ransacked everything," Cleaves noticed.'
- ! '"Not ransacked, searched," the Doctor corrected.'
- ! '"Through our stuff," she snapped back.'
- ! '"Well, their stuff," Olivia argued.'
- ! '"Searching for what?"'
- ! '"Conformation," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"They need to know their memories are real."'
- ! '"Oh, so they''ve got flaming memories now," Buzzer snapped.'
- ! '"They feel compelled to connect to their lives, yes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Their stolen lives," Cleaves shot back.'
- ! '"You gave it to them," Olivia snapped back, leaning next to the Doctor on the
  table.'
- ! '"You poured your personalities, emotions, traits, memories and secrets into them.'
- You gave them your lives."
- ! '"Human lives are amazing," the Doctor continued.'
- ! '"Are you surprised they walked off with them?"'
- ! '"I''ll say it again," Buzzer blurted.'
- ! '"Isle of Sheppey.'
- This bloke's ear was all hanging—"
- ! '"Even if this has actually happened," Jimmy cut in, glaring at Buzzer before
  turning to the Doctor.'
- ! '"They can''t remain stable without us plugged into them.'
- Can they, boss?"
- All eyes turned to Cleaves, but she hesitated for a moment before replying, "I guess
  we'll find out."
- ! '"Are you ok?"'
- ! '"Do you need some water?"'
- ! '"I feel funny," she replied in a shaky voice.'
- ! '"I need the washroom."'
- ! '"I-I''ll go with you," Rory called, hurrying after her.'
- ! '"Liv, go with them," the Doctor told her.'
- ! '"Yeah," she replied, making him look up at her in wide-eyed wonder when she stepped
  around him and went for the door, surprised she hadn''t argued.'
- ! '"The Doctor''s always saying, ''Don''t wander off''," he explained as Olivia
  crossed her arms, leaning on the stone threshold as she watched Jennifer carefully.'
- ! '"First rule with him actually: ''Don''t wander off.''"'
- ! '"I just need a minute," Jennifer reported, staring at herself in the mirror.'
- ! '"Oh, yeah, sure," Rory blurted then rambled, "Take all the time you need.'
- You're fine."
- ! '"Rory, give the lady some privacy," Olivia advised, making him turn to her with
  a frown but she only lifted a hand to twirl it in the air, telling him to turn his
  back.'
- ! '"Jennifer?"'
- ! '"What''s up, Jennifer?"'
- ! '"We, uh, better get going," he called.'
- ! '"Everything ok in there, Jen?"'
- ! '"Rory, get out," Olivia ordered him, making him frown at her as she only stared
  at the blob of white puke Jennifer had left in the sink.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Get out!"'
- ! '"Just let us live!"'
- ! '"Let her go!"'
- ! '"Rory—!"'
- ! '"Get out of here!"'
- ! '"I can''t leave you!"'
- ! '"I''ll be fine, just go!"'
- ! '"Liv!"'
- ! '"You ok?'
- What happened?"
- ! '"Where''s Rory?"'
- ! '"He ran," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"Jennifer''s a Ganger."'
- ! '"He ran and left you here?!"'
- ! '"I told him to," Olivia assured him.'
- ! '"She attacked us."'
- ! '"Doctor, you said they wouldn''t be violent," Amy recalled.'
- ! '"But I did say they were scared and angry," he reminded her, looking into Olivia''s
  eyes to be sure she was alright.'
- ! '"And early technology is what you said," Jimmy recalled, making Olivia frown
  at the Doctor in wonder when she heard him.'
- ! '"You seem to know something about the Flesh."'
- ! '"Do you?"'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"You''re no weatherman," Jimmy realized.'
- ! '"Why are you really here?"'
- ! '"I have to talk to them," the Doctor insisted.'
- ! '"I can fix this."'
- ! '"Wait!"'
- ! '"What''s going on?!'
- Where's the real Jennifer?!"
- Theta, what's going on?"
- ! '"We didn''t come here by accident and you obviously know something about the
  Flesh.'
- What the hell aren't you telling me?"
- Can we not do this now, Liv, please?"
- ! '"It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks!"'
- ! '"We have to find Rory!"'
- ! '"Yes, we''re going back to the TARDIS," he told her.'
- ! '"Wait for us in the dining hall.'
- No more wandering off."
- ! '"And what about Rory?"'
- ! '"It''ll be safer to look for him and Jennifer in the TARDIS," she assured them.'
- ! '"Exit?"'
- ! '"Keep going straight, can''t miss it," Jimmy replied.'
- ! '"But you''re never gonna get your vehicle in here."'
- ! '"I''m a great parker," the Doctor smirked back before heading for the exit.'
- ! '"You sure you don''t want me to stay with Amy?"'
- ! '"She''ll go after Rory anyway, you know that."'
- ! '"Yes, but I need you with me, now," he told her as they made at turn, but she
  stopped and pulled her hand from his, making him whirl on her with a frown.'
- ! '"Liv—?"'
- ! '"What''s going on?"'
- ! '"You already knew about the Flesh before we got here.'
- Why won't you tell me?!"
- ! '"If it''s any consolation, I wouldn''t have told you anything if Amy and Rory
  weren''t with us," he shot back, stepping closer to loom over her.'
- ! '"Now stop it, and do as I say.'
- I promise, Liv."
- ! '"I asked when we first met if you trusted me, and you said yes," he recalled.'
- ! '"Trust me now, my love."'
- ! '"Of course I trust you," she breathed.'
- ! '"I''ve always trusted you."'
- ! '"Did it scan you again?"'
- ! '"Yes," he replied, hurrying down the stairs and Olivia gasped at the sight of
  the TARDIS sinking into the ground, only the roof visible.'
- ! '"What are you doing down there?"'
- ! '"Doctor, get back up here!"'
- ! '"God, you''re an idiot.'
- What do we do now?"
- ! '"Follow me," he replied, grabbing her hand and pulling her with him again.'
- ! '"We''ve gotta find the Gangers."'
- ! '"Why?!"'
- ! '"They''re trying to kill us!"'
- ! '"Only that one," he recalled.'
- ! '"And she wasn''t trying to kill you.'
- Like the humans that created them, they lash out when they're frightened."
- ! '"Didn''t feel like fright to me when she tried choking me to death," Olivia muttered.'
- ! '"Did I mention they''re also angry?"'
- ! '"What''s this?"'
- ! '"The acid room," he replied, pulling her through the door and heading down the
  stairs.'
- ! '"Look!'
- The suits!"
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor greeted.'
- ! '"How are you all getting on?"'
- ! '"Why don''t you tell us?"'
- ! '"Well, we have two choices," the Doctor began.'
- ! '"The first is to tear each other apart…not my favorite.'
- If you like option two, you can follow me back to the dining hall where everyone
  is waiting and I'll explain everything to them."
- ! '"Why should we trust you?"'
- ! '"We''re not trying to harm you," Olivia replied, stepping next to the Doctor.'
- ! '"He wants to help you."'
- ! '"Excellent!"'
- ! '"Now, I know it''s difficult, but do you think you could…put your faces on?"'
- ! '"Now, I know it''s hard for you to hold your fully human form," he called as
  he led them toward the dining hall.'
- ! '"That''s why you keep shifting between the Flesh stages.'
- It'll make the others less scared of you."
- ! '"We hope," Olivia muttered, making him nudge her arm with his.'
- It wasn't long before they reached the doorway where they heard Amy say, "Let's
  not do anything at all…"
- ! '"Until the Doctor gets here!"'
- ! '"Hello."'
- ! '"This is…" Jimmy trailed off.'
- ! '"You''re telling me," Ganger Jimmy agreed.'
- ! '"Alright, Doctor, you''ve brought us together, now what?"'
- ! '"Before we do anything, I have one very important question," the Doctor replied
  then asked, "Has anybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow?'
- Although I should warn you, I have very wide feet."
- ! '"Here," she said, shoving the shoes into his hands.'
- ! '"It''s these or no shoes.'
- Which would you prefer, dear?"
- ! '"The Flesh was never merely moss," he told them all.'
- ! '"These are not copies.'
- They are becoming people."
- ! '"With souls?"'
- ! '"Rubbish," Dicken blurted before sneezing.'
- ! '"Bless you," Ganger Dicken said.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"We were all jelly, once.'
- Little jelly eggs, sitting in goop."
- ! '"Yeah, thanks.'
- Too much information," Amy shot back, as Olivia couldn't help but giggle.
- ! '"We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped up," the Doctor
  continued.'
- ! '"We are talking about sacred life.'
- Do you understand?"
- ! '"Good," he nodded.'
- ! '"Now, the TARDIS is trapped in an acid pool.'
- How does that sound?"
- ! '"Can we go home for Adam''s birthday?"'
- ! '"What about me?"'
- ! '"He''s my son, too."'
- ! '"You?'
- You really think that?"
- ! '"I feel it."'
- ! '"Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you?"'
- ! '"Yeah.'
- I miss home as much as you."
- ! '"I''m not gonna lie to you.'
- It's a right odd mess, this," the Doctor confessed.
- ! '"But as you might say up north, ''Oh, well, I''ll just go to the foot of the
  stairs.'
- Eh, by, by gum.'" He looked to Olivia with a grin but she closed her eyes with a
  frown, biting her lips as she shook her head.
- ! '"Or not.'
- First step is we get everyone together, then get everyone safe, then get everyone
  out of here."
- ! '"Cleaves and Jennifer are still missing," Olivia reminded him.'
- ! '"I''ll go look for them," Jimmy reported, turning to head toward the door.'
- ! '"I''ll give you a hand, if ya like," Ganger Jimmy offered, heading after him.'
- ! '"Cover more ground."'
- ! '"Yeah," Jimmy replied.'
- ! '"Ok, thanks."'
- ! '"This circus has gone on long enough!"'
- ! '"Oh, great," Ganger Cleaves muttered.'
- ! '"You see, that is just so typically me."'
- ! '"Doctor, tell it to shut up!"'
- ! '"Please, no," the Doctor pleaded, heading toward Cleaves.'
- ! '"No!'
- No!"
- ! '"Circuit probe," Cleaves explained.'
- ! '"Fires about, ooh, forty thousand volts.'
- Would kill any one of us, so I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same."
- ! '"What I find amusing is that you call the Gangers ''it'' but the glorified cattle
  prod is a ''she''," Olivia shot back.'
- ! '"When the real people are safely off this island, then I''ll happily talk philosophy
  over a pint with you, Miss Felton," Cleaves retorted.'
- ! '"What are you gonna do to them?"'
- ! '"Sorry," Cleaves replied.'
- ! '"They''re monsters, mistakes.'
- They have to be destroyed."
- ! '"Give me the probe, Cleaves," the Doctor suggested, calmly.'
- ! '"We always have to take charge, don''t we, Miranda?"'
- ! '"Even when we don''t really know what the heel is going on."'
- ! '"Stop!"'
- ! '"He''s dead!"'
- ! '"We call it decommissioned," Cleaves replied, still aiming her probe at Olivia
  as she glared at her, her own hands up in surrender.'
- ! '"You stopped his heart," the Doctor reported.'
- ! '"He had a heart!'
- Aorta, valves…a real, human heart, and you stopped it!"
- ! '"Jen?"'
- ! '"What happened to Buzz will happen to us all if we trust you!"'
- ! '"Wait, just wait," the Doctor pleaded.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"You idiot!"'
- ! '"Wait!"'
- ! '"Look at what you''ve done, Cleaves," he ground out, taking the probe and throwing
  it aside, effectively breaking it.'
- ! '"You''ve started a war," Olivia growled.'
- ! '"If it''s war then it''s war," Cleaves shot back.'
- ! '"You don''t get it, the pair of you.'
- Us and them."
- ! '"Us and them, Dicken agreed.'
- ! '"Us and them," Jimmy replied.'
- ! '"Idiots," Olivia growled.'
- ! '"This is the stupidest thing to happen that wasn''t your fault," Olivia hissed
  at the Doctor in irritation as Cleaves spoke to the men in her crew.'
- ! '"Oi!"'
- ! '"When have I ever—?!'
- Don't answer that."
- ! '"Exactly," Olivia murmured, looking over her shoulder at Amy and Rory wrapping
  Ganger Buzzer''s body and arguing about Ganger Jennifer.'
- ! '"Rory''s in a whole lot of trouble for being so chummy with Jennifer."'
- ! '"They''ll sort it," he assured her.'
- ! '"And since it seems we have no choice, we''ll have to work with what we have.'
- Cleaves, the most fortified and defendable room in the monastery?"
- ! '"The chapel," she replied.'
- ! '"Only one way in, stone walls two feet thick."'
- ! '"You''ve crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves," he warned her.'
- ! '"You''ve killed one of them.'
- They're coming back…in a big way."
- ! '"We should get to the chapel," Olivia suggested, looking to Cleaves and asking,
  "Where is it?"'
- ! '"Follow me," she replied, leading the way out the door and through the halls
  as they all followed her, Olivia holding tight to the Doctor''s hand as they ran
  through the building.'
- ! '"What about the flares?"'
- ! '"We''ll worry about the flares when we''re locked inside," the Doctor replied,
  making Olivia frown at him as she passed him, but froze when they heard a scream
  from somewhere in the monastery, making Rory stop and look back.'
- ! '"Rory," Olivia called in warning, seeing the look in his eyes.'
- ! '"Rory, come on," Amy urged.'
- ! '"Jen''s out there," he said.'
- ! '"She''s out there and she''s on her own."'
- ! '"Well, if she''s got any sense then she''s hiding," the Doctor assured him.'
- ! '"I can''t leave her out there," Rory insisted.'
- ! '"I know you understand that."'
- ! '"Rory Williams, don''t be stupid!"'
- ! '"We''ve had enough stupidity for one day!"'
- ! '"Get in here!"'
- ! '"There they are!"'
- ! '"Rory!"'
- ! '"Amy, they''re not after him," the Doctor assured her.'
- ! '"They''re after us."'
- ! '"Why?!'
- Why?!"
- ! '"Show yourself," the Doctor called.'
- ! '"Show yourself!"'
- ! '"Doctor, don''t!"'
- ! '"This is insane," Jimmy laughed.'
- ! '"We''re fighting ourselves!"'
- ! '"Yes, it''s insane and it''s about to get even more insanerer," the Doctor replied
  as Amy and Olivia ran up next to him and he glanced between them.'
- ! '"Is that a word?'
- Show yourself, right now!"
- ! '"Doctor, we are trapped in here and Rory is out there with them," Amy reminded
  him, but when he only stared ahead and didn''t answer she called, "Hello!'
- We can't get to the TARDIS, and we can't even leave the island."
- ! '"Correct in every respect, Pond," the voice they''d heard earlier replied…a voice
  that sounded exactly like the Doctor''s.'
- ! '"It''s frightening, unexpected, frankly a total, utter, splattering mess on the
  carpet.'
- But I'm certain, one hundred percent certain, that we can work this out."
- ! '"Trust me," Ganger Doctor said, straightening his bowtie.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor."'
- ! '"What…the…hell?"'
- ! '"What''s happening?!"'
- ! '"One day, we will get back," Ganger Doctor strained as Olivia''s hand slipped
  from the Doctor''s arm and she watched the two in terror, Amy right trying to help
  the crew barricade the door.'
- ! '"Yes.'
- One day."
- He jerked in pain again, screaming in agony, shouting, "Reverse the polarity of
  the neutron flow!"
- ! '"Doctor, what''s he doing?!"'
- ! '"The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations," he explained then
  told his Ganger, "Hold on!"'
- ! '"Would you like a Jelly Baby?"'
- ! '"Why?'
- Why?!"
- ! '"''Why?'
- Why' what?"
- ! '"Hello, I''m the Doctor.'
- We've moved on!"
- ! '"Listen to me!"'
- ! '"Hold on!'
- You can stabilize."
- ! '"I''ve reversed the Jelly Baby of the neutron flow," Ganger Doctor, slurred,
  as if he were drunk.'
- ! '"And would you like a…Doctor."'
- ! '"Hold on," the Doctor urged when it looked like his Ganger was fading.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Liv, go to him," the Doctor ordered her, making her frown at him as she helped
  him stand tall.'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"You''ll help him stabilize," he explained, pushing her toward him.'
- ! '"Go!"'
- ! '"Why?!"'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"Liv…" he breathed, reaching for her and gripping her shoulders, firmly as she
  held his arms.'
- ! '"Olivia Felton.'
- Why?!"
- ! '"I…I don''t know," she frowned, feeling a lump forming in her throat when she
  saw suffering in his eyes.'
- ! '"I don''t know what you''re saying."'
- ! '"Liv," he sighed, pulling her closer and hugging her tightly and she hugged him
  in return just as the banging at the door stopped.'
- ! '"I think I liked it better when they were being noisy," Buzzer admitted.'
- ! '"Doctor," Amy called, irritably.'
- ! '"We need you.'
- Get over here!"
- ! '"Cybermats," the Doctor asked Ganger Doctor.'
- ! '"Do we have time for this?"'
- ! '"We make time," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"I''d like more proof that you''re me.'
- Cybermats."
- ! '"Created by the Cybermen," Ganger Doctor replied, nuzzling Olivia''s cheek and
  making her giggle.'
- ! '"They kill by feeding off brainwaves."'
- ! '"Liv, ask him a question," the Doctor ordered, making her frown at him over her
  shoulder as Ganger Doctor stared down at her.'
- ! '"Something only you and I would know."'
- ! '"Oh…ok," she fumbled before looking to Ganger Doctor and asking, "Um…what''s
  in my eyes?"'
- ! '"Starlight," Ganger Doctor smiled, warmly.'
- ! '"You''ve always had starlight in you eyes, Liv.'
- Even Jack saw it."
- Olivia couldn't help but smile before looking to the Doctor and smirking, "Ya know…two
  Doctors could be really interesting."
- ! '"Liv, behave," Ganger Doctor murmured in her ear.'
- ! '"Oh, yeah," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"He''s you."'
- ! '"Thought so," the Doctor couldn''t help but smirk before telling her, "Go help
  out Amy and the others.'
- Be with you in a moment."
- ! '"Are you sure there aren''t any weapons we could get to, like big guns with bits
  on them?"'
- ! '"Yeah, big guns would be good right now," Buzzer agreed.'
- ! '"Why would we have guns?"'
- ! '"We''re a factory.'
- We mine."
- ! '"Steam," Olivia blurted, pointing at the door and making them turn to the barricaded
  door, watching the steam hiss up from it.'
- ! '"Acid," Amy realized before the banging came back.'
- ! '"Oh, great," Olivia sighed.'
- ! '"They figured that out."'
- ! '"Rory and Amy, they might not trust both of us," the Doctor to her left said,
  making her glance between them as she stood in front of them.'
- ! '"Are you thinking what I''m thinking?"'
- ! '"Inevitably."'
- ! '"See, I''m glad we''re on the same…"'
- ! '"Wavelength.'
- Great minds."
- ! '"Exactly.'
- So what's plan?"
- ! '"We save them all, humans and Gangers."'
- ! '"Tall order.'
- Sounds wonderful."
- ! '"Is that what you were thinking?"'
- ! '"Yes.'
- It's just so inspiring to hear me say it."
- ! '"I know."'
- ! '"Just so you know," Olivia cut in, making them both look to her.'
- ! '"When I said interesting, this isn''t what I had in mind."'
- ! '"I know," they replied together, making her stare back at them with wide eyes.'
- ! '"Ok, that''s just…weird," she blurted.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"So, what now Doctor?"'
- ! '"Well, time to get cracking, Doctor."'
- ! '"Hello!'
- Sorry," they said together as she and Amy looked down at their shoes to find them
  wearing two different pairs.
- ! '"But we had to establish a few…"'
- ! '"Ground rules, formulate a…"'
- ! '"Protocol."'
- ! '"Protocol, very posh."'
- ! '"Protocol between us, otherwise…"'
- ! '"It gets horribly embarrassing…"'
- ! '"Potentially confusing."'
- ! '"Potentially?"'
- ! '"It''s already confusing."'
- ! '"Ok, well, I''m glad you solved the problem of confusing," Amy snapped.'
- ! '"That''s sarcasm," the Doctor holding Olivia''s hand noticed.'
- ! '"She''s very good at sarcasm," the Doctor smirked before they both looked at
  her.'
- ! '"Breathe!"'
- ! '"We have to get you off this island," he told them, still frowning at Olivia.'
- ! '"And the Gangers too," the other Doctor replied just as Olivia grabbed his left
  hand to examine it as well.'
- ! '"Sorry, would you like a memo from the last meeting?"'
- ! '"They are trying to kill us!"'
- ! '"They''re scared!"'
- ! '"Doctor, we''re trapped in here," Amy said to the Doctor on Olivia''s left who
  stepped ahead.'
- ! '"Right, see, I don''t think so," he began.'
- ! '"The Flesh bowl is fed by cabling from above."'
- ! '"But where are the Earthing conduits?"'
- ! '"Well, this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaft, or something, yes?'
- With us?"
- ! '"Yowza!'
- You know I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressive it is to hand out with
  me."
- ! '"Do we tend to say, ''Yowza''?"'
- ! '"Only sometimes," Olivia smirked, knowingly.'
- ! '"That''s enough," the Doctor stopped her from going on.'
- ! '"Let it go, ok?'
- Liv, be quiet."
- ! '"See?"'
- ! '"Interesting."'
- ! '"Stop it," Ganger Doctor smirked.'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"Hold up, you two," Olivia called, grabbing the Doctor''s sleeve before he could
  pass by with Cleaves who led the group farther down the halls.'
- ! '"You''ve obviously got something going on.'
- Some grand scheme, and I'll play along, but don't think you can gang up on me just
  because there's two of you, got it?"
- ! '"Yes, Liv," they replied together, both nodding, making her glance between them
  before heading after the group, dragging Ganger Doctor with her.'
- ! '"Still weird," she muttered as they caught up with group.'
- ! '"The army will send a recon team out," Jimmy explained.'
- ! '"We need to find a way to contact the mainland," Cleaves reported.'
- ! '"What about Rory and Jen?"'
- ! '"They are both out there."'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"This place is a maze.'
- I bet you lot have got a computer map, haven't you?"
- ! '"If we can get power running, we can scan for them," Cleaves reported.'
- ! '"It''ll be a lot quicker."'
- ! '"Doctor," Amy choked.'
- ! '"You said earlier to breathe."'
- ! '"Very important, Pond, breathe," he replied.'
- ! '"Yeah, well, I''m struggling to," she retorted.'
- ! '"Acid interacting with the stone, creating an asphyxiant miasma," he explained,
  still choking.'
- ! '"A what?"'
- ! '"Choking gas!"'
- ! '"Extra heavy.'
- If we could get above it!"
- ! '"Evac tower, this way!"'
- ! '"I think I coughed so hard I pulled a muscle or something," Amy strained, making
  the Doctor look to her in worry.'
- ! '"It''s ok.'
- It's easing off."
- ! '"Midnight," Jimmy realized.'
- ! '"It''s Adam''s birthday.'
- Happy birthday, bud."
- ! '"Need help?"'
- ! '"Not just yet," Ganger Doctor replied.'
- ! '"But thanks, Liv," the Doctor replied as she stepped between them to lean back
  and watch them work.'
- ! '"Can you really get the power back?"'
- ! '"Oh, there''s always some power floating around…" Ganger Doctor replied, before
  ducking down as the Doctor stood tall to look over the computers.'
- ! '"Sticking to the wires like bits of lint," he finished.'
- ! '"Can you stop finishing each other''s—?"'
- ! '"Sentences," the Doctor finished Amy''s sentence.'
- ! '"No probs."'
- ! '"I kinda like it, if my opinion matters," Olivia chimed in, making Amy send a
  glare at her as both Doctor''s came up and kissed a cheek each, making her grin.'
- ! '"Of course your opinion matters," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"It always matters," Ganger Doctor smiled before they both ducked down to work
  on the panel.'
- ! '"Oh, you are just eating this up, aren''t you?"'
- ! '"No, but hang on, you said that the TARDIS was stuck in acid, so won''t she be
  damaged?"'
- ! '"Nah," the Doctor drawled, standing to look at her.'
- ! '"She''s a tough old thing.'
- Tough…old…Sexy."
- ! '"Yeah, tough, dependable Sexy," Ganger Doctor smiled, making Olivia roll her
  eyes but she couldn''t help but smirk.'
- ! '"Come on, ok?"'
- ! '"How can you both be real?"'
- ! '"Well, because…" Ganger Doctor replied, examining something then looked up at
  her, "…we are.'
- I'm the Doctor."
- ! '"Yeah, and so am I!"'
- ! '"We both contain the knowledge of over nine hundred years of memory and experience,
  we both wear the same bowtie, which is cool."'
- ! '"Because bowties are," Ganger Doctor added.'
- ! '"And always will be," the Doctor grinned.'
- ! '"You guys are so cute!"'
- ! '"How can you be ok with this?"'
- ! '"I dunno," she replied.'
- ! '"I''ve seen weirder things, I think.'
- This just kinda gets me…excited and giddy."
- ! '"Now, Liv," the Doctor began.'
- ! '"Behave," Ganger Doctor smirked, making her giggle as he winked at her.'
- ! '"But how did the Flesh read you?"'
- ! '"Because you weren''t linked up to it."'
- ! '"Well, it must''ve been after I examined it," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"That''s when the new, genuine Doctor was created."'
- ! '"Ta-da!"'
- ! '"Let the fun begin," Olivia grinned, biting her lower lip as she winked at the
  Doctor.'
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Please!"
- ! '"Leave the hormones in the TARDIS!"'
- ! '"Why, when it''s so much fun to tease you?"'
- ! '"No getting away from it," Amy cut in, making the three look to her.'
- ! '"One of you was here first."'
- ! '"Well, ok, after the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident with a puddle of acid,"
  the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Now, new shoes.'
- A situation which does not confront me learned self, here."
- ! '"That satisfy you, Pond?"'
- ! '"Don''t call me ''Pond,'' please," she retorted, making the Doctors and Olivia
  frown at her in confused wonder.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"You feel more affection for him, than…him," Olivia noticed, pointing to the
  Doctor on her left then to the Ganger Doctor on her right.'
- ! '"No, no," she tried to object, looking to the Ganger Doctor.'
- ! '"Look, you''re fine, and everything, but he''s the Doctor.'
- No offense, being almost the Doctor is pretty damned impressive."
- ! '"Being almost the Doctor is like being no Doctor at all," Ganger Doctor retorted,
  defensively.'
- ! '"Don''t overreact," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"You might as well call me ''Smith''!"'
- ! '"Smith?"'
- ! '"John Smith."'
- ! '"Olivia, help me out here!"'
- ! '"Sorry, you''re on your own, Red," Olivia shrugged, dismissively before the panel
  lit up.'
- ! '"Yes!"'
- ! '"Communication: a go!"'
- ! '"Find Rory!"'
- ! '"Show me the scanny/tracky screen."'
- ! '"Come on, Rory.'
- Let's be having ya."
- ! '"There''s no sign of him anywhere," Cleaves noticed, still working.'
- ! '"Come on, come on, baby, show yourself," Amy pleaded.'
- ! '"Let''s see if we can''t get word to the mainland while it tracks him," Cleaves
  reported, working at the panel before speaking into the microphone.'
- ! '"St.'
- Come in."
- ! '"We''ll never get a signal through the storm," she muttered before working at
  the panel again.'
- ! '"St.'
- This is urgent."
- ! '"We''re just about reading you, St John''s," the Captain on the other end of
  the line replied, making everyone sigh in relief.'
- ! '"How are you doing?'
- We've had all kinds of trouble here."
- ! '"Request immediate evacuation," Cleaves called.'
- ! '"We''re under attack.'
- They're running amok."
- ! '"Your Gangers?"'
- ! '"Yes, our Gangers are attacking us.'
- We need you to take us off the island immediately and wipe them out."
- ! '"Copy that, St.'
- Hang on."
- ! '"You''ll need to airlift us off the roof of the evac tower.'
- I'm typing it, in case they're listening in."
- ! '"Got it.'
- We'll swing in, get you out and decommission the Flesh."
- ! '"What do we do now?"'
- ! '"We wait," he murmured.'
- ! '"And hope at least the Gangers come to their senses."'
- ! '"I hope they do, too."'
- ! '"We''re gonna get out of here," Jimmy grinned up at Buzzer, patting his arm.'
- ! '"Look, we''re not leaving without them," Amy shot back from where she sat with
  the Doctor at the panel where he worked.'
- ! '"I want them found, too, but it''s about casualties, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"It can''t be helped."'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"Making a phone call," he replied.'
- ! '"Who to?"'
- ! '"No one yet.'
- It's on delay."
- ! '"Right, not getting it.'
- Why, exactly, are you making a phone call?"
- ! '"Because, Amy, I am, and always will be, the optimist.'
- The hoper of far-flung hopes…" He spun in his chair, "…the dreamer of improbable
  dreams."
- ! '"The wheels are in motion.'
- Done."
- ! '"You know, really there can be only one," Amy told the Doctor.'
- ! '"Hm?"'
- ! '"Nothing," she sighed.'
- ! '"Carry on.'
- Be amazing."
- ! '"Wow, she really doesn''t like having two Doctors around," Olivia muttered as
  Ganger Doctor turned his back on them.'
- ! '"Sh," he whispered gently, making her frown at him but he glanced over his shoulder
  at Amy as she stood, looking to the far wall in confusion.'
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"What happened?"'
- ! '"It''s her again," Amy told the Doctor.'
- ! '"It''s who again?"'
- ! '"There''s a woman I keep seeing, a woman with an eye patch, and she has this
  habit of sliding walls open and staring at me."'
- ! '"Did you know about that?"'
- ! '"Not a clue," she whispered back.'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"It''s nothing," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"A lie," Olivia murmured so low only Ganger Doctor could hear her.'
- ! '"It doesn''t seem like nothing," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"It''s a time memory," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Like a mirage.'
- There's nothing to worry about."
- ! '"It''s in my head," Ganger Doctor murmured, drawing everyone''s attention him
  before shaking his head and stepping out the door.'
- ! '"Hey, hold on!"'
- ! '"Don''t go!"'
- ! '"No, leave it to me," Amy assured them, heading after him as Olivia frowned at
  the door before watching Amy head after him in surprise before turning to the Doctor
  and strolled toward him to sit in the chair Amy had vacated.'
- ! '"I know what you''re doing," she smirked, making him look at her with cool confidence
  as she narrowed her gaze at him.'
- ! '"Do you?"'
- ! '"Wanna know how I figured it out?"'
- ! '"The rings.'
- And my Highwayman would know better than to take his off."
- He slowly frowned, making her frown back in wonder, but before she could ask what
  was wrong, all he murmured was, "Why?"
- ! '"Keep him away from me!"'
- ! '"Did you sense it?"'
- ! '"Briefly, not as strong as you," the Doctor confirmed.'
- ! '"Sense what?"'
- ! '"Amy, I''m sorry," Ganger Doctor said, remaining in the center of the room.'
- ! '"No, ok?'
- We can't trust you," Amy shot back.
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"You didn''t see what I just saw!"'
- ! '"It would appear I can connect to the Flesh," he reported.'
- ! '"You are Flesh," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"I''m beginning to understand what it''s been through, what it needs."'
- ! '"What you want.'
- You are it."
- ! '"Amy, shut your trap before I shut it for you," Olivia snapped, meeting Amy''s
  glare with one of her own.'
- ! '"It''s much more powerful than we thought," Ganger Doctor continued, trying to
  keep them from fighting as well as explaining himself.'
- ! '"Flesh can grow, correct?"'
- ! '"Its cells can divide," Cleaves retorted.'
- He stepped closer to her to explain, "Well, now it wants to do that at will.
- It wants revenge."
- ! '"I was right," Amy realized.'
- ! '"You''re not the Doctor.'
- You're just a copy."
- ! '"Amy—!"'
- ! '"It''s alright, Liv," Ganger Doctor nodded to Olivia, seeing her rage glowing
  in her eyes and she bit her lip as she nodded and remained silent.'
- ! '"Doctor," Cleaves chirped, making Ganger Doctor look to her.'
- ! '"It might be best if you stayed over there for now."'
- ! '"Hold on a minute," the Doctor spoke up.'
- ! '"Hold your horses.'
- I'm him, he's me."
- ! '"Doctor, we have no issue with you," Cleaves conceded.'
- ! '"But when it comes to your Ganger…"'
- ! '"Don''t be ridiculous," Olivia ground out.'
- ! '"They''re the same person!"'
- ! '"Olivia, stop," Ganger Doctor told her again, meeting her gaze again.'
- ! '"Save it for something more important."'
- ! '"You look like a bull ready to charge, Liv," the Doctor noted as his Ganger turned
  to sit on a barrel that Buzzer pulled up to have him sit where everyone could see
  him.'
- ! '"I''m glad you think this is amusing, because right now, I''m disgusted with
  my own species," Olivia ground out before turning to pace behind the panel.'
- ! '"Take a seat, mate," Buzzer entreated Ganger Doctor.'
- ! '"Nice barrel," he replied, sitting on it.'
- ! '"Very comfy.'
- Is this really what you want?"
- ! '"You weren''t there," Amy told her.'
- ! '"I thought he was gonna hurt me."'
- ! '"You know him better than that," Olivia snarled, lowly, still pacing.'
- ! '"But it wasn''t him," Amy argued.'
- ! '"They''re one in the same."'
- ! '"They''re not the same!"'
- ! '"Have you learned nothing since you met him?!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"This is the shuttle," the Captain''s voice came from the panel.'
- ! '"We''re right above you but we can''t get low enough.'
- Just—"
- ! '"Hello?'''
- ! '"Can you hear me?"'
- ! '"We''ve gotta find Rory," she insisted.'
- ! '"I''m gonna go out there."'
- ! '"We could use the Sonic to track him," the Doctor advised, looking at the results
  from his scan.'
- ! '"Humans and Gangers give off slightly different signals.'
- The Sonic needs to tell the difference."
- ! '"Oh, so the Sonic knows Gangers are different, so the other Doctor is different,
  then," Amy reasoned.'
- ! '"He is the Doctor," Olivia ground out.'
- ! '"Not to me," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Unlike some people, I can tell."'
- ! '"Are you sure you''re not prejudiced?"'
- ! '"Nice try," Amy smirked back at him.'
- ! '"But I know you, ok?'
- You're my Doctor, end of."
- ! '"Excuse me, your Doctor?!"'
- ! '"You know what I mean," Amy replied.'
- ! '"Olivia, go sit with my Ganger," the Doctor ordered when she stopped in front
  of Amy, sending both their gazes to him.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"No.'
- Don't let her near him!"
- ! '"Olivia, do as I say," the Doctor said, firmly.'
- ! '"Go sit with him."'
- ! '"Least it makes him easier to share with River now," Amy blurted.'
- ! '"Doctor, you better shut her up before that pretty face of hers gets reassembled!"'
- ! '"Both of you, stop, now!"'
- ! '"Hey, there''s a camera up," Buzzer noticed and all eyes turned to the TV screen
  on the panel.'
- ! '"We''ve got a visual."'
- Amy hurried toward it to stare at the screen, reporting, "That's Rory and Jennifer."
- ! '"They''re heading for the thermostatic room," Cleaves noticed in confusion.'
- ! '"Let''s go get them," Amy told the Doctor, who responded by tossing his Sonic
  toward Olivia and his Ganger.'
- ! '"Hang on."'
- ! '"You can''t let him go," Cleaves snapped.'
- ! '"Are you crazy?!"'
- ! '"Am I crazy, Doctor?"'
- ! '"Well, you did once plug your brain into the core of an entire planet just to
  halt its orbit and win a bet," Ganger Doctor replied, making the Doctor smile proudly,
  but it instantly fell when he met Olivia''s incredulous stare.'
- ! '"You know what that could do to you, idiot?!"'
- ! '"He can''t go rescue them," Amy insisted.'
- ! '"I''m going."'
- ! '"Do you know?'
- I want him to go," the Doctor replied, standing from his chair to meet Amy's gaze
  in a challenge.
- ! '"And I''m rather adamant."'
- ! '"I''m going with him," Olivia added, standing to let Ganger Doctor stand as well.'
- ! '"Since it seems I''m just as unwelcome."'
- ! '"Liv, stop it," the Doctor scolded her before nodding, "Good idea, though.'
- Two great minds working together."
- ! '"Well, then, they''ll need company," Buzzer spoke up.'
- ! '"Right, boss?'
- I'll handle it."
- Olivia couldn't help but frown at his words, but Ganger Doctor only snapped his
  fingers, replying, "Thank you, Buzzer.
- Liv and I will find him."
- ! '"I''m sorry," she murmured, making him frown at her as he used the Sonic ahead
  to scan for life, still walking.'
- ! '"What for?"'
- ! '"For all my yelling," she replied.'
- ! '"I probably sound like an old hag."'
- ! '"It''s not me you should apologize to for that," he told her.'
- ! '"You should be apologizing to Amy."'
- ! '"I know," she muttered.'
- ! '"She''s just being such a—"'
- ! '"What the bloody hell was that?"'
- ! '"Something''s gone wrong," Ganger Doctor guessed.'
- ! '"We need to find them."'
- ! '"It''s getting something," he reported as they hurried into an open area.'
- ! '"Human?"'
- ! '"Yeah, it''s human, but it''s fading, it''s fading!"'
- ! '"This is bad.'
- Fading is very…bad."
- ! '"Doctor, there!"'
- ! '"It''s Jennifer!"'
- ! '"The signal''s gone," he reported, kneeling next to Olivia.'
- ! '"She''s…dead.'
- She was hanging on to the edge of life, but she just…just slipped away."
- ! '"Jennifer," Olivia shuddered, feeling tears come to her eyes.'
- ! '"We''re so sorry.'
- You can feel it on her skin."
- ! '"But if the real Jen''s been lying out here…" Buzzer mused.'
- ! '"Oh, my God," Olivia gasped, looking to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Rory!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Sorry, but it''s boss'' orders," he replied, meeting her disbelieving gaze.'
- ! '"Us and them, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"And what about me?"'
- ! '"You gonna knock me out too?"'
- ! '"No, you get to come back with me," he replied.'
- ! '"Not a chance," she retorted, shuffling toward the Doctor''s unmoving body.'
- ! '"I''m gonna stay here with him and make sure he''s alright.'
- If you've killed him, I'll hunt you down later."
- ! '"Idiot," she muttered, then froze when she heard footsteps coming toward them.'
- ! '"We came out here looking for Rory and Jennifer, not you."'
- ! '"Hello, Liv," he grinned, but she only looked back to the Gangers in front of
  them, making him look up at them as well and ask, "Got anything for a sore head?"'
- ! '"This is how they''ll always treat us," Ganger Cleaves told him.'
- ! '"Do you see now?'
- After all, you're one of us, Doctor."
- ! '"Call me Smith," he sighed, finding the Sonic and tucking it into his jacket.'
- ! '"John Smith."'
- ! '"What about her?"'
- ! '"Bring her with us," Ganger Doctor replied through a smirk, making her frown
  at him in confusion.'
- ! '"She''ll make a nice hostage, don''t you think?"'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"What the hell''s the matter with you!"'
- ! '"Theta…why are you doing this?"'
- He said nothing as she swallowed against the lump of fear in her throat as she stared
  at his glare before he ground out, "Ring-ring."
- ! '"Let me go!"'
- ! '"Olivia?'
- What are you doing here?"
- ! '"Oh, good," Ganger Doctor hummed.'
- ! '"Another hostage.'
- Love a hostage."
- ! '"A what?"'
- ! '"They''re all Gangers," Olivia explained, glancing between all of them as Jennifer
  smirked at them.'
- ! '"You created another Ganger just to trick me," Rory snapped at Jennifer.'
- ! '"You tricked me.'
- When I found you, you were both Flesh and you tricked me into trusting you!"
- ! '"Rory, what happened?"'
- ! '"Where are the others?"'
- ! '"They''re locked in the crypt with the acid," he choked.'
- ! '"The Doctor said this whole building''s gonna go up.'
- I didn't know."
- ! '"Jen''s dead," Rory shuddered then roared, "Isn''t she?!"'
- ! '"She''s gone, Rory!"'
- ! '"Gone."'
- ! '"Shuttle," a voice came of the PA, making everyone stop to listen.'
- ! '"We''re dropping down on our approach.'
- Stand by for evac."
- ! '"The humans will be melted, as they deserve and then the factory will be destroyed,"
  Jennifer explained.'
- ! '"Once we get to the mainland, the real battle begins.'
- You're one of us, Doctor."
- She snapped her fingers with a cute smile, adding, "Join the revolution."
- ! '"We''ve got to go and get them out," Rory realized and tried to make for the
  door but Ganger Doctor shoved him away, making him stumble back next to Olivia and
  stare at him in disbelief.'
- ! '"No way.'
- Doctor, we can't just let them die."
- Olivia frowned when he looked to his watch then said, "Ring-ring."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Ring-ring!"'
- ! '"Rory, don''t," she told him, making him frown at her incredulously.'
- ! '"But Amy and the Doctor—!"'
- ! '"Just wait!"'
- ! '"Listen to me, Rory!'
- Stay here!"
- ! '"Ah, that''ll be the phone," Ganger Doctor grinned, making Olivia smile in relief,
  seeing him come back to his usual Doctor self.'
- ! '"Somebody get the phone.'
- Stay put."
- ! '"Ha!"'
- ! '"Hello!'
- It's your birthday."
- ! '"Yay!"'
- ! '"Yay!"'
- ! '"Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping on the bed."'
- ! '"Yes, really high," Adam replied.'
- ! '"I expect chocolate for breakfast," Ganger Doctor instructed.'
- ! '"If you don''t feel sick by mid-morning you''re not doing it right.'
- Now, I think you want to speak to your dad."
- ! '"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"'
- ! '"Daddy?"'
- ! '"You''ll do, Jimmy," Ganger Doctor said, turning to him and heading toward him.'
- ! '"What does the other Jimmy matter now, you''re both the same dad, aren''t you?'
- Come on, Adam's waiting."
- ! '"Daddy," Adam called and the building rumbled.'
- ! '"Daddy, what''s that rumbly noise?'
- What's going on, Daddy?"
- ! '"Daddy?"'
- ! '"You tricked him into an act of weakness, Doctor," Jennifer snapped at him.'
- ! '"No, I''ve helped him into an act of humanity," Ganger Doctor argued, calmly.'
- ! '"Anyone else like the sound of that?'
- ! '''Act of humanity''?"'
- ! '"I do," Olivia smirked, drawing his attention to her and she gave him a wink.'
- ! '"Dicken," Ganger Cleaves called.'
- ! '"Drain the acid well in Crypt One."'
- ! '"Don''t you dare!"'
- ! '"I''ve had it with this!"'
- ! '"What''s the point in this ridiculous war?'
- I don't want my world populated by monsters."
- ! '"You can''t stop the factory from melting down…boss," Jennifer retorted.'
- ! '"I''ll take revenge on humanity, with or without you."'
- ! '"Why does it have to be about revenge?"'
- ! '"It can be about equality!"'
- ! '"Now what?"'
- ! '"Daddy," Adam called, still on the hologram call.'
- ! '"Where''s my daddy?"'
- ! '"I''m glad you''re safe," she whispered as he hugged her in return.'
- ! '"Me too," he murmured, making her giggle before she pulled away and turned to
  watch Jimmy speak to the hologram.'
- ! '"Daddy, it''s me!"'
- ! '"Hey, Sunshine," he grinned.'
- ! '"What are you up to?"'
- ! '"Where''s the original Jimmy?"'
- ! '"Opening all my presents," Adam answered.'
- ! '"Ha, ha, good lad," Jimmy smiled.'
- ! '"You have fun today.'
- And remember, your dad…he loves you very, very much."
- ! '"When are you coming home?"'
- ! '"Daddy''s coming home today, Adam," he smiled.'
- ! '"Yay!"'
- ! '"Now we need to move," he announced.'
- ! '"Run," one Doctor ordered, but they all stared at Jennifer.'
- ! '"Run," the other Doctor agreed, and they all turned.'
- ! '"Run!"'
- ! '"Ooh, the roof''s gonna give!"'
- ! '"This door doesn''t lock," Ganger Dicken realized as he and Dicken held it shut.'
- ! '"No, but the far one does," Dicken replied, opening the door and heading back
  out.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Here she comes," he hummed, making Olivia frown, but when the ceiling rumbled
  she grabbed onto his arm and gave a short, startled scream when the TARDIS came
  through the roof and landed with a thump.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- She does like to make an entrance!"
- ! '"Liv, get her started," the Doctor nearest her called.'
- ! '"Everyone, move!"'
- ! '"What the…?"'
- ! '"Oh, my God, this thing is—"'
- ! '"Save that line for when the Doctor gets here," Olivia cut Cleaves off as she
  hurried back down the stairs to the entrance, adding as she passed her, "He loves
  hearing it."'
- ! '"Now''s our chance!"'
- ! '"I have to stay, hold this door closed, and give you time to dematerialize,"
  he argued.'
- ! '"Oh, don''t be crazy!"'
- ! '"What happens to you?"'
- ! '"Well, this place is just about to explode, but I can stop her," he replied.'
- ! '"Both of you can survive, this, ok?"'
- ! '"There has to be a way."'
- ! '"Or perhaps you think I should stay, instead," the other Doctor replied, stepping
  in front of them.'
- ! '"Mr.'
- Smith."
- ! '"No, of course not," Amy objected.'
- ! '"But look, this man, I''ve flown with him, you know?'
- I'm sorry."
- ! '"Amy we swapped shoes," the Doctor at the door told her, making her eyes shoot
  to him before looking back at the Doctor standing in front of her.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor," he explained.'
- ! '"And I''m the Flesh," Ganger Doctor replied from behind her before the wall shook
  again from Jennifer trying to get in.'
- ! '"You can''t be," Amy breathed, turning to the door.'
- ! '"You''re the real him."'
- ! '"No, I''m not," he replied.'
- ! '"And I haven''t been all along."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I''m the original Doctor, Amy," the Doctor said again.'
- ! '"We had to know if we were treated the same.'
- It was important…vital, we learn about the Flesh and we could only do that through
  your eyes."
- ! '"What about her?!"'
- Amy questioned, gesturing to Olivia before asking her, "You knew all along, didn't
  you?"
- ! '"I didn''t know just by looking at them, Amy," Olivia replied, calmly and honestly.'
- ! '"The only way I could tell them apart was the rings.'
- They needed your eyes, not mine."
- ! '"I never thought it possible," Amy told him.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"You''re twice the man I thought you were," she replied.'
- ! '"Push, Amy," Ganger Doctor whispered.'
- ! '"But only when she tells you to."'
- ! '"Amy, come on!"'
- ! '"Well, my death arrives, I suppose," Ganger Doctor realized, casually.'
- ! '"But this one we''re not invited to," the Doctor replied, making Olivia shoot
  wide eyes at him in disbelief.'
- ! '"Later," he told her before pushing her toward his Ganger.'
- ! '"Say goodbye to him."'
- ! '"Your molecular memory can survive this, you know," he assured him and Ganger
  Cleaves as he pulled his Sonic from his jacket.'
- ! '"It may not be the end."'
- ! '"Yeah, well if I turn up to nick all your biscuits, then you''ll know you were
  right, won''t you?"'
- ! '"You''re gonna need this," she whispered, pressing her mouth to his and kissing
  him deeply, her heart breaking before she pulled away and whispered, "For luck."'
- ! '"I love you," he murmured.'
- ! '"My girl.'
- My Liv."
- ! '"Come on, Liv," the Doctor called, and she placed another quick kiss to his lips
  before turning and rushing toward the TARDIS, the Doctor following her.'
- ! '"Doctor!'
- No!"
- ! '"You, too, Cleaves," Ganger Doctor told her.'
- ! '"Off you pop."'
- ! '"I''m staying," she replied.'
- ! '"This is not the time for grand gestures!"'
- ! '"Says the King of Grand Gestures!'
- I'm not going anywhere."
- ! '"Foreman Miranda Cleaves!"'
- ! '"Marvelous.'
- Beware of imitations."
- ! '"Clear off out of here, the lot of you!"'
- ! '"I''m…sorry," she said, making Olivia look up at her in surprise before smiling.'
- ! '"I''m sorry, too," she replied, turning back to the console.'
- ! '"We''re good."'
- ! '"Yeah," Amy nodded, making Olivia glance up with a smile before Amy glanced to
  the Doctor.'
- ! '"I-I told him…"'
- ! '"I know," Olivia cut in, glancing to the Doctor as well.'
- ! '"You thought you were talking to his Ganger.'
- He knows now, and we'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
- ! '"He''s very quiet," Amy noticed, making Olivia look up at him again to see him
  leaning on the console, lost in thought.'
- ! '"I got it," she murmured, stepping around the console to stand next to him, staring
  at him before she placed her hand on his arm, whispering, "Theta?"'
- ! '"The energy from the TARDIS will stabilize the Gangers for good," he announced
  to everyone.'
- ! '"They''re people now."'
- ! '"And what happens to me?"'
- ! '"I still have this."'
- ! '"Ah!'
- That's not a problem!"
- ! '"I have something for that.'
- It's…It's small, red, and it tastes like burnt onions!"
- ! '"But it''ll get rid of your blood clot."'
- ! '"Happy endings," Olivia grinned as the Doctor leaned over to pull a red balloon
  attached to the console, making her giggle as he grinned at her.'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"Amy told me," he replied, making her swallow, but she kept his gaze.'
- ! '"I invited you all…to my death?"'
- ! '"Yeah," she choked, then sniffled, "That was why we were so surprised to see
  you at the diner.'
- We saw the older you…die."
- The Doctor sighed before pulling his arm from hers to hug her with it, setting his
  cheek on her head and murmuring, "I'm sorry you had to see that, Liv.
- No wonder you got so cross when I tried asking you questions."
- ! '"Well, the cat''s out of the bag," she sighed.'
- ! '"Where to next?"'
- ! '"We have to drop off Cleaves and Dicken," he replied, kissing her head before
  taking her hand to lead her back toward the TARDIS.'
- ! '"We''ll talk…much later."'
- ! '"Do you really want us to do this?"'
- ! '"Your company is telling the world that the situation is over," the Doctor began.'
- ! '"But you need to get in there and tell them that the situation has only just
  begun.'
- Make them understand what they're doing to the Flesh, make them stop."
- ! '"Dicken, remember that people are good," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"Deep down we are truly good.'
- Don't hate us."
- ! '"How can I hate you?"'
- ! '"I''m one of you now."'
- ! '"Yeah, and just remember, people died.'
- Don't let that be in vain," the Doctor added.
- ! '"Make what you say in that room count."'
- ! '"Ready?"'
- ! '"Side by side."'
- ! '"You got it, Boss," Dicken smiled back before they stepped through the doors
  and the Doctor rubbed at his chin as Olivia frowned up at him, sensing something
  was wrong.'
- ! '"You ok?"'
- ! '"I said breathe, Pond, remember?"'
- ! '"Well, breathe."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Breathe," he said again.'
- ! '"What''s wrong with her?"'
- ! '"Come on, we need to get her into the TARDIS," Olivia urged, holding onto one
  of Amy''s arms as she gasped in pain, Rory helping her as well.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"What is happening to her?"'
- ! '"Contractions," the Doctor replied, leaning on the console as Olivia stared at
  his back in disbelief.'
- ! '"Contractions?"'
- ! '"She''s going into labor," the Doctor confirmed.'
- ! '"Did he say…?"'
- ! '"No, of course he didn''t.'
- Ow."
- ! '"You''re gonna have to start explaining some of this to me, Doctor," Rory called.'
- ! '"What, the birds and the bees?"'
- ! '"She''s having a baby.'
- That's a beautiful word…shenanigans."
- ! '"Theta, she''s in pain and your word play isn''t helping," Olivia ground out,
  making him turn and look to Amy.'
- ! '"Breathe," he told her, making Olivia rush toward her again.'
- ! '"I needed enough information to block the signal to the Flesh."'
- ! '"What signal?"'
- ! '"The signal to you," he replied.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Stand away from her, Rory," the Doctor told him.'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"No!'
- And why?"
- ! '"Given what we''ve learned, I''ll be as humane as I can, but I need to do this
  and you need to stand away!"'
- ! '"Rory," Olivia murmured, tears welling in her eyes as he looked to her with a
  frown.'
- ! '"You need to trust him, like we''ve always trusted him.'
- Step away."
- ! '"No," Amy breathed, trying to hold onto his hand but it fell away from hers when
  Olivia pulled him out of reach and Amy stared at Rory incredulously before turning
  to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Doctor, I am frightened," Amy shuddered, tears in her eyes.'
- ! '"I''m properly, properly scared."'
- ! '"Don''t be," he told her, stepping closer to touch her cheek.'
- ! '"Hold on.'
- Whatever happens, however hard, however far, we will find you."
- ! '"I''m right here," she breathed, taking his hand in both of hers.'
- ! '"No, you''re not," he replied, stepping back again and pulling his hand from
  hers.'
- ! '"You haven''t been here for a long, long…time."'
- ! '"No," Amy breathed before the sound of the Sonic filled the room and Amy dissolved
  into a pile of Flesh on the floor.'
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"Amy, no."'
- ! '"What are we gonna do?"'
- ! '"We are going to find Amelia Pond."'
- ! '"Intruder, Level Nine," the Cyberman reported as it and two other Cybermen stood
  at a computer in the center of the control room.'
- ! '"Seal Level Nine."'
- ! '"And he''ll only keep going," Olivia smirked as one of them held her arms behind
  her back, restraining her.'
- ! '"Intruder Level Eleven.'
- Intruder Level Fifteen."
- ! '"Prepare to engage," the Cyberman announced as they all stepped toward the door
  and Olivia used her Sonic on the door into the control room to open it.'
- ! '"I have a message and a question," he announced, his voice full of command as
  Olivia stepped next to him.'
- ! '"A message from the Doctor…and a question from me: Where…is…my…wife?"'
- ! '"Oh, don''t give me those blank looks," he retorted before strolling toward the
  window to his left, Olivia following, her Sonic at the ready to disable their guns
  if she needed to.'
- ! '"The Twelfth Cyberlegion monitors this entire quadrant.'
- You tell me now, and I'll be on my way."
- ! '"What is the Doctor''s message?"'
- ! '"Would you like me to repeat the question?"'
- ! '"Where to now?"'
- ! '"London!"'
- ! '"1888.'
- Need Silurians on our side."
- ! '"Nice," Olivia grinned, flipping a few switches.'
- ! '"And then?"'
- ! '"A Sontaran."'
- ! '"And then?"'
- ! '"Some more clever people.'
- Just fly the TARDIS."
- ! '"Madame Vastra," he greeted, letting the Silurian in as Olivia turned to see
  her.'
- ! '"And Jenny!'
- How are you?"
- ! '"Wow, you guys brought a lot," Olivia smirked, eyeing the swords strapped to
  Vastra and Jenny.'
- ! '"From what I remember, we''re going to need it," Vastra smirked.'
- ! '"Right!'
- Onwards to the Battle of Zaruthstra!"
- ! '"Need to get Commander Strax."'
- ! '"What did you do?"'
- ! '"Something River showed me," she smirked, making him glare at her comically before
  the ship shuddered to a halt.'
- ! '"Well, I said it was a battle," he replied, running to the door to open it as
  Rory came down the stairs, still in his Centurion outfit.'
- ! '"What''s going on?"'
- ! '"Who are they?"'
- ! '"Madame Vastra, Jenny, meet Rory," Olivia introduced, working on the console.'
- ! '"Rory, Vastra and Jenny."'
- ! '"And Commander Strax!"'
- ! '"This place has never been so full!"'
- ! '"Alright, we need to get Dorium Maldovar and one more!"'
- ! '"Who''s the ''one more''?"'
- ! '"The most diabolical, the most clever, the most feared person in the known universe,"
  the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"River Song," Olivia guessed, making him stop and purse his lips.'
- ! '"Yes," he muttered, making her smirk before they operated the TARDIS to a halt
  again.'
- ! '"Olivia, Rory, go get her, yes?'
- I'm gonna go pick up Dorium."
- ! '"Yes, Sir," Olivia replied, giving a salute as she and Rory hurried toward the
  door.'
- ! '"Oh," she smiled.'
- ! '"Are you boys dressing up as Romans now?'
- I thought nobody read my memos."
- ! '"Doctor Song," Rory called as he and Olivia stepped out of the shadows.'
- ! '"It''s Rory and Olivia."'
- ! '"Sorry, h-have we met yet?"'
- ! '"Timestreams…I''m not quite sure where we are."'
- ! '"Yes," River replied, stepping closer to them.'
- ! '"Yes, we''ve met.'
- Hello, Rory."
- ! '"River, what''s wrong?"'
- River glanced between them before finally recovering herself and replying, "It's
  my birthday.
- He got Stevie Wonder to sing for me under London Bridge."
- ! '"Stevie Wonder sang in 1814?"'
- ! '"Yes, he did," River grinned.'
- ! '"But you must never tell him."'
- ! '"Sounds heavenly," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"And you look amazing."'
- ! '"Thank you, Olivia," River grinned, stepping toward her to hug her tightly.'
- ! '"We''ve come from the Doctor, too," Rory explained as River stepped back.'
- ! '"Yes, but at a different point in time," River nodded.'
- ! '"Unless there''s two of them," Rory joked.'
- ! '"Now, that''s a whole different birthday," River smirked, making Olivia slap
  a palm to her face.'
- ! '"Always around me," she sighed before River patted her shoulder then turned toward
  her open cell as she pulled her diary from the muff she held to look at it.'
- ! '"He needs you," Rory told her and she closed her book again.'
- ! '"Demons Run," she replied, making Rory glance to Olivia but she only watched
  River closely.'
- ! '"How…how did you know?"'
- ! '"I''m from his future.'
- Why on Earth are you wearing that?"
- ! '"The Doctor''s idea," Rory replied of his outfit.'
- ! '"Of course," River smirked.'
- ! '"His rules of engagement: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."'
- ! '"Look ridiculous," he added.'
- ! '"Have you considered heels?"'
- ! '"They''ve taken Amy," he explained, trying to stay on topic.'
- ! '"And our baby."'
- ! '"The Doctor''s gathering everyone to go after her, but he needs you, too," Olivia
  explained, stepping closer to her.'
- ! '"I can''t," River breathed, making the two stare at her in shock.'
- ! '"Not yet, anyway."'
- ! '"I''m sorry?"'
- ! '"This is the battle of Demons Run," River explained.'
- ! '"The Doctor''s darkest hour.'
- He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall so much further…and I can't be
  with him till the very end."
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Because this is it," she replied before turning to head into her cell.'
- ! '"This is the day he finds out who I am."'
- ! '"Rory, go back to the TARDIS," she murmured.'
- ! '"If he''s not there, wait for him.'
- He was gonna pick up Dorium…something or other."
- ! '"What are you—?"'
- ! '"Just go, Rory, please?"'
- ! '"Olivia, you won''t convince me to go with you," River warned her.'
- ! '"I know," Olivia replied, meeting her gaze.'
- ! '"That''s not why I''m here.'
- Tell me so I can be there for him."
- ! '"Oh, Mrs.'
- Sigma," River smiled, warmly.
- ! '"You don''t need to know what to expect to be there for him.'
- You and I both know it."
- ! '"You''ve always been there, for the both of us…every time.'
- Be there for him when I can't."
- ! '"Where''s River?"'
- ! '"Olivia.'
- Where's River?"
- ! '"She''s not coming," she finally replied, glancing to the huge, blue man standing
  off to the side as Rory sat on the stairs leading deeper into the TARDIS.'
- ! '"What do you mean she''s not coming?"'
- ! '"She said she can''t," Olivia replied again in an even tone.'
- ! '"Let it go, Theta."'
- He set his jaw as he eyed her and stepped closer to murmur, "What aren't you telling
  me?"
- ! '"A lot," she retorted, looking up to meet his gaze.'
- ! '"You''re gonna have to trust me on this."'
- ! '"Now let''s go get Amy."'
- ! '"He is not the devil," Colonel Manton announced to his Clerics of Demons Run,
  surrounded by men in hoods.'
- ! '"He is not a god.'
- ! 'The Doctor is a living, breathing man, and as I look around this room, I know
  one thing: We''re sure as hell gonna fix that."'
- ! '"Yes!"'
- ! '"On this day, in this place, the Doctor will fall."'
- ! '"Hooah!"'
- ! '"The man who talks, the man who reasons, the man who lies, will meet the perfect
  answer."'
- ! '"Hooah!"'
- ! '"Some of you have wondered why we have allied ourselves with the Headless Monks.'
- It's time you knew what these guys have sacrificed for faith."
- ! '"As you know, it is a Level One heresy, punishable by death, to lower the hood
  of a Headless Monk.'
- But, by the divine grant of the Papal Mainframe herself, on this one and only occasion,
  I can show you the truth."
- ! '"Because these guys never can be…" Colonel Manton lowered the hood of the monk
  to reveal no head, but a neck that was twisted off, "…persuaded.'
- They never can be…" He lowered the next monk's hood, "…afraid.
- And they can never, ever be…"
- The next monk lowered his head on his own, grinning, "Surprised!"
- The crowd gasped as the Doctor stepped around Manton to laugh and grin, "Hello,
  everyone!
- Please…point a gun at me, if it helps you relax."
- ! '"You''re only human," the Doctor added.'
- ! '"Doctor, you will come with me right now," Manton ordered, holding his handgun
  to his head as he turned to him.'
- ! '"Three minutes, forty seconds," he smirked.'
- ! '"Amelia Pond!'
- Get your coat!"
- ! '"I''m not a phantom," the Doctor announced from somewhere they couldn''t see.'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"I''m not a trickster."'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"I''m a monk."'
- ! '"Doctor, show yourself!"'
- ! '"It''s him!"'
- ! '"He''s here!'
- It's him!"
- ! '"Weapons down!"'
- ! '"Do not fire!"'
- ! '"Do not fire!'
- I am disarming my weapon pack."
- ! '"Monks, I do this in good faith.'
- I am now unarmed."
- ! '"All of you, discharge your weapon packs.'
- We are not fools."
- The Clerics began discharging their weapons, causing the monks to lower their swords
  as the Clerics shouted, "We are not fools."
- ! '"Well, you may not be fools," Olivia smirked, stepping next to Colonel Manton
  who turned to her in shock as she placed her foot over his weapon''s pack.'
- ! '"But you are certainly surrounded."'
- ! '"This base is now under our command," Strax told him, holding a gun toward Manton
  as he stepped up next to Olivia.'
- ! '"I have a fleet out there," Manton warned them.'
- ! '"If Demons Run goes down, there''s an automatic distress call."'
- ! '"Not if we knock out your communications array," the Doctor announced from the
  PA system.'
- ! '"And you''ve got incoming."'
- ! '"Danny Boy to the Doctor.'
- Danny Boy to the Doctor," a man called over the PA.
- ! '"Give ''em hell, Danny Boy!"'
- The asteroid shook as the spitfires attacked, then Danny Boy reported soon after,
  "Target destroyed."
- ! '"Liv, Strax…bring him in," the Doctor told them over the PA.'
- ! '"With pleasure," Olivia grinned, lifting her foot from the pack on the floor.'
- ! '"Very well done, boy," Strax commended Olivia, making her frown at him in wonder.'
- ! '"Thank you, Commander," she replied as Manton cradled his hand and Strax stepped
  closer to him.'
- ! '"No more tricks, or you will be vaporized," he ordered.'
- ! '"Follow the boy."'
- ! '"Girl," Olivia corrected when Manton frowned at him.'
- ! '"Me."'
- ! '"All airlocks sealed," Strax announced as they stepped into the room where Vastra,
  Dorium and the Doctor waited.'
- ! '"Resistance neutralized."'
- ! '"Sorry, Colonel Manton, I lied," the Doctor said as Manton stepped to the middle
  of the room, Olivia stepping next to the Doctor where he sat in the control chair.'
- ! '"Three minutes, forty-two seconds."'
- ! '"Colonel Manton, you''re gonna give the order to withdraw," Olivia told him.'
- ! '"No…Colonel Manton," the Doctor corrected.'
- ! '"I want you to tell your men to run away."'
- ! '"You what?"'
- ! '"Those words: ''Run away.'''
- I want children laughing outside your door because they found the house of Colonel
  Run Away."
- ! '"And when people come to you and ask if trying to get to me through the people
  I love is in any way, a good idea…I want you to tell them your name."'
- ! '"Oh, look, I''m angry.'
- That's new."
- He looked back at Manton to tell him, "I'm really not sure what's going to happen
  now."
- ! '"The anger of a good man is not a problem."'
- ! '"Good men have too many rules," she continued.'
- The Doctor slowly turned to her, replying, "Good men don't need rules."
- ! '"Today is not the day to find out why I have so many," he warned, staring her
  down.'
- ! '"Give the order," she permitted, her tone dripping with venom but it didn''t
  lessen everyone''s surprise, including the Doctor''s, that she''d given in so easily.'
- ! '"Give the order, Colonel Run Away."'
- ! '"Strax, Vastra, take care of this," he ordered.'
- ! '"Where are we going?"'
- ! '"We''re going to find Amy and Rory," he explained, turning a corner.'
- ! '"By now he''s got the baby and found Amy.'
- We just have to make sure they're all ok."
- ! '"Hey," Olivia called, making him stop and whirl on her with wide eyes.'
- ! '"You were…amazing, my love."'
- He grinned and straightened his bowtie, saying, "I was, wasn't I?"
- ! '"You always are," she smiled.'
- ! '"You weren''t so bad yourself, darling," he smiled fondly, lifting a hand to
  move some hair from her face.'
- ! '"But next time, let Strax vaporize the person pulling the gun on you."'
- ! '"Hey!'
- I thought that was a good move!"
- ! '"It was," he conceded with a nod before turning to drag her down the hall again.'
- ! '"Ew," he sneered when they stepped through.'
- ! '"Crying and kissing.'
- We'll…we'll be back in a bit."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Oi, you," Rory called, turning to the door.'
- ! '"Get in here, now."'
- ! '"My daughter," Rory introduced as Olivia leaned down and gently touched her little
  hand with her finger.'
- ! '"What do you think?"'
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"Hello, uh…baby."'
- ! '"Melody," Amy told them.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- Melody!"
- ! '"I love it!"'
- ! '"Melody," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"Hello, Melody Pond."'
- ! '"Melody Williams," Rory corrected him.'
- ! '"Is a geography teacher," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Melody Pond is a superhero."'
- ! '"She''s adorable," Olivia grinned, gently playing with her tiny hand then frowned
  at the Doctor when he leaned over and took in a long, loud sniff before standing
  tall.'
- ! '"Well, yes, I suppose she does smell nice," he spoke to Melody.'
- ! '"I never really sniffed her.'
- Amelia Pond, come here."
- ! '"Sorry we were so long."'
- ! '"It''s ok," Amy replied as the Doctor smelled her hair then pulled away.'
- ! '"I knew you were coming.'
- Our boys, right Olivia?"
- ! '"And now, Melody''s boys," Olivia agreed as the baby cooed.'
- ! '"It''s ok, she''s still all yours," the Doctor told Melody.'
- ! '"And really, you should call her Mummy, not Big Milk Thing."'
- ! '"Ok, what are you doing?"'
- ! '"I speak baby," he replied, casually, and Olivia couldn''t help but smirk, proudly
  before turning her attention back to Melody.'
- ! '"No, you don''t," Amy argued.'
- ! '"I speak everything," he retorted.'
- ! '"Don''t I, Melody Pond?"'
- ! '"No it''s not," the Doctor responded, straightening his bowtie.'
- ! '"It''s cool."'
- ! '"Why yes, she is pretty, and she smells good, too," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"Who''s she talking about now?"'
- ! '"She''s talking about Olivia," the Doctor answered.'
- ! '"Aw, thanks Melody," Olivia smiled down at her.'
- ! '"You''re quite the looker too."'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Take a look.'
- My friend, you have never risen higher."
- ! '"What''s that look for?"'
- ! '"Nothing," she lied, wrapping her arms around one of his as he frowned at her.'
- ! '"You''re lying," he murmured in realization and she swallowed but still smiled.'
- ! '"Well…I learned from the best, didn''t I?"'
- ! '"Shall we head to the TARDIS?'
- I bet Melody wants to see it!"
- ! '"Y-Yeah," Amy nodded, reaching out to Rory to take Melody, and he handed her
  over, carefully.'
- ! '"Keep a lookout, darling," he smiled, leaning over to press a kiss to her cheek.'
- ! '"I''ll only be a minute with Amy."'
- ! '"Madame Vastra said—"'
- ! '"Yeah," Olivia cut Rory off when she reached him.'
- ! '"I heard her.'
- I knew it was too easy."
- ! '"What do we do?"'
- ! '"There''s nothing we can do," she sighed.'
- ! '"This has to happen however it''s gonna happen.'
- We can't change anything."
- ! '"Hey, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"She doesn''t like the TARDIS noise," Amy explained.'
- ! '"I asked him to turn something off, but it was all, ''But I don''t wanna punch
  a hole in the space-time continuum.''"'
- ! '"Olivia," Jenny called, drawing their attention to her as she approached with
  Strax.'
- ! '"The Judoon have escorted the Clerics out of the quadrant, the spitfires have
  returned to their own time, Captain Avery and his men are—Is she alright?"'
- ! '"She''s just crying," Olivia replied of Melody, waving it off.'
- ! '"Give her to me, human fools!"'
- ! '"She needs changing!"'
- ! '"I just changed her," Amy replied as they all looked at him warily.'
- ! '"I think she might need a feed."'
- ! '"A feed," Strax replied.'
- ! '"Of course.'
- I'll take care of everything."
- ! '"Uh…" Rory hummed, stepping up to him.'
- ! '"I don''t think you will, actually."'
- ! '"I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties," Strax retorted, then slammed
  a hand onto his chest, saying, "I can produce magnificent quantities of lactic fluid!"'
- ! '"Oh, that was way too much info for me," Olivia blanched.'
- ! '"She''s not hungry, she''s tired," the Doctor called, coming out of the TARDIS
  carrying a wooden cot with a solar system attached to it and he set it down on one
  of the crates.'
- ! '"Sorry, Melody, they''re just not listening."'
- ! '"What''s this, Melody?"'
- ! '"Very pretty, according to your daughter," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"It''s a cot," Rory replied.'
- ! '"No flies on the Roman," the Doctor muttered making Rory frown at him.'
- ! '"Give her to me," Olivia grinned, reaching for Melody with grabby hands, making
  them all laugh as Amy handed her over.'
- ! '"But where would you get a cot?"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Nothing," he smirked before Olivia gently placed Melody in the cot.'
- ! '"It''s old," Amy noticed of the cot.'
- ! '"Really old.'
- Doctor, um, do you have children?"
- ! '"No," he replied, tucking Melody into the cot then glanced up at Olivia to murmur,
  "Not yet…anyway."'
- ! '"Have you ever had children?"'
- ! '"No, no, it''s real," he replied to Melody.'
- ! '"It''s my hair."'
- ! '"Who slept in here?"'
- ! '"Doctor, we need you in the main control room," Vastra called of the PA.'
- ! '"Be right there!"'
- he called back then told Amy and Rory, "Things to do.
- We can't leave till we know."
- ! '"But this is where I was?"'
- ! '"The whole time I thought I was on the TARDIS, I was really here?"'
- ! '"Um…Centurion, permission to hug?"'
- ! '"Be aware, I do have a sword," he added, making the Doctor laugh before looking
  to Olivia.'
- ! '"Wife, permission to hug?"'
- ! '"Be aware, Rory has a sword," Olivia smiled with a nod, releasing his hand to
  let him hug Amy.'
- ! '"You were on the TARDIS, too," he explained.'
- ! '"Your heart, your mind, your soul.'
- But physically, yes, you were still in this place."
- ! '"And when I saw that face looking through the hatch," Amy asked.'
- ! '"That woman looking at me?"'
- ! '"Reality bleeding through.'
- They must've taken you quite a while back, just before America."
- ! '"That''s probably enough hugging now," Rory warned.'
- ! '"Yeah, have to agree with Rory," Olivia chimed in, as the Doctor stepped back
  from Amy and Olivia took his arm.'
- ! '"So, her Flesh avatar was with us all that time?"'
- ! '"But that means they were projecting a control signal right into the TARDIS,
  wherever we were in time and space."'
- ! '"Yeah, they''re very clever," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Who are?"'
- ! '"Whoever wants our baby," Rory guessed.'
- ! '"But why do they want her?"'
- ! '"Exactly," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Is there anything you''re not telling us?"'
- ! '"You knew Amy wasn''t real.'
- You never said."
- ! '"Well, I couldn''t be sure they weren''t listening," the Doctor explained before
  heading again toward the hall leading to the main control room.'
- ! '"But you always hold out on us," Amy recalled, stopping him again and turning
  to them.'
- ! '"Please, not this time.'
- One little thing."
- ! '"It''s mine," he replied, making Olivia look up at him with a wide-eyed frown.'
- ! '"What is?"'
- ! '"The cot," the Doctor replied, pointing to it as Olivia let out a silent sigh
  of relief.'
- ! '"It''s my cot.'
- I slept in there."
- ! '"Shame on you, Olivia Felton," he scolded playfully, making her frown up at him.'
- ! '"What—?"'
- ! '"You thought I was talking about Melody when I said that."'
- ! '"Well, can ya blame me when you say it like that?"'
- ! '"Liv, you know I''d never do that to you."'
- ! '"I know," Olivia sighed.'
- ! '"It''s just my insecurities spilling out.'
- Now I know how you felt when it was me and Jack."
- ! '"Finally," he sighed, making her nudge him, playfully as they rounded into the
  control room and he asked Dorium, "You''ve hacked into their software, then?"'
- ! '"I believe I sold it to them," Dorium retorted, working at the controls.'
- ! '"Ooh!'
- So what have we learned?"
- ! '"That anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake," Vastra replied, making
  him turn a frown to her.'
- ! '"I''m sorry?"'
- ! '"The words of an old friend.'
- Who once found me in the London underground attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly
  innocent tunnel diggers."
- ! '"Well, you were very cross at the time," he replied.'
- ! '"As you were today, old friend," she observed.'
- ! '"Point taken, I hope."'
- ! '"Now, I have a question," she replied.'
- ! '"A simple one: Is Melody human?"'
- ! '"Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"Of course she is.'
- What are you talking about?"
- ! '"They''ve been scanning her since she was born," Dorium explained as Olivia released
  the Doctor and stepped next to Dorium to look at the screen.'
- ! '"And I think they found what they were looking for."'
- ! '"Human DNA," the Doctor observed, stepping up to Olivia and Dorium to look at
  the screen as well.'
- ! '"Look closer, my love," Olivia as he stepped next to her.'
- ! '"She''s human plus."'
- ! '"Specifically human plus Time Lord," Vastra explained, making Olivia whirl on
  him with a glare.'
- ! '"Now, Liv, don''t look at me like that," he warned.'
- ! '"What…did…you…do?"'
- ! '"Nothing!"'
- ! '"She''s human.'
- She's Amy and Rory's daughter."
- ! '"You''ve told me about your people," Vastra recalled.'
- ! '"They became what they did through prolonged exposure to the Time Vortex, the
  untempered schism."'
- ! '"Over billions of years," he reminded her.'
- ! '"It didn''t just happen!"'
- ! '"How much of a Time Lord is she?"'
- ! '"Can she regenerate?"'
- ! '"No, no," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"I don''t think so."'
- ! '"Sounding real sure there, dear," Olivia shot back.'
- ! '"Because I don''t understand how this happened," he admitted.'
- ! '"Which leads me to ask when did it happen?"'
- ! '"When?"'
- ! '"I am trying to be delicate," Vastra confessed.'
- ! '"I know how you can blush."'
- ! '"And can''t he?"'
- ! '"When did this baby…begin?"'
- ! '"Oh, you mean…?"'
- ! '"When was she conceived?"'
- ! '"Yes, thank you, Liv," he shot back, straightening his bowtie.'
- ! '"Well, how would I know?'
- They don't put up a balloon, or anything."
- ! '"But could the child have begun on the TARDIS, in flight, in the Vortex?"'
- ! '"No!'
- So, technically, the first time they were on the TARDIS together, in this version
  of reality, was on their w—"
- ! '"Oh, god," Olivia groaned when he cut himself off.'
- ! '"On their what?"'
- ! '"On their wedding night."'
- ! '"It doesn''t make sense," the Doctor insisted to Olivia, Vastra and Dorium in
  the main control room.'
- ! '"You can''t just cook yourself a Time Lord!"'
- ! '"Of course not," Vastra sighed.'
- ! '"But you gave them one hell of a start and they''ve been working very hard ever
  since."'
- ! '"And, yet, they gave in so easily," Dorium noticed.'
- ! '"Does this not bother anyone else?"'
- ! '"Bothers me," Olivia blurted, raising her hand.'
- ! '"Amy," the Doctor continued thinking aloud as Olivia Lowered her hand.'
- ! '"She worried the baby would have a time head."'
- ! '"Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother," Vastra retorted.'
- ! '"Or the instincts of a coward," Dorium added.'
- ! '"Or your wife," Olivia chimed in.'
- ! '"Dorium''s got a point.'
- Something's fishy."
- ! '"Why even do it?"'
- ! '"Even if you could get your hands on a brand new Time Lord, what for?"'
- ! '"A weapon?"'
- ! '"Why would a Time Lord be a weapon?"'
- ! '"Babe," Olivia called gently, making him look to her in wonder before she met
  his gaze and sighed, "They''ve seen you."'
- ! '"Me?"'
- ! '"Mr.'
- Maldovar, you're right," Vastra confessed as Olivia hugged the Doctor's chest and
  he reflexively wrapped his arm around her shoulders to hug her, deep in thought.
- ! '"This was too easy.'
- We should get back to the others."
- ! '"Me?"'
- ! '"Am I…?"'
- ! '"I see you accessed our files," the woman, Madame Kovarian, noticed as her face
  suddenly appeared on one of the computer screens, making them both jump and stare
  at it with wide eyes.'
- ! '"Do you understand yet?'
- What do you think?"
- ! '"What is she?"'
- ! '"Hope.'
- Hope in the endless, bitter war."
- ! '"What war?'
- Against who?"
- ! '"Against you, Doctor."'
- ! '"A child isn''t a weapon!"'
- ! '"Oh, give us time.'
- She will be."
- ! '"Except you''ve already lost her, and, I swear, I will never let you anywhere
  near her again," the Doctor shot back.'
- ! '"Oh, Doctor.'
- Fooling you once was a joy, but fooling you twice the same way…it's a privilege."
- ! '"Amy," he breathed before shooting toward the door, Olivia bolting after him.'
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"Amy, she''s not real!'
- Melody…she's a Flesh avatar!"
- ! '"Yeah," Rory replied solemnly.'
- ! '"We know."'
- ! '"It''s strange," Strax strained in pain.'
- ! '"I have often dreamed of dying in combat.'
- I'm not enjoying it as much as I'd hoped."
- ! '"Come on, Strax," Rory urged.'
- ! '"Don''t give up."'
- ! '"It''s alright.'
- I'm nearly twelve."
- ! '"Listen to me.'
- You're a warrior."
- ! '"Rory…I''m a nurse."'
- ! '"So they took her anyway," she shuddered.'
- ! '"All this was for nothing."'
- ! '"I am so…sorry," the Doctor breathed as she stood, tears streaming down her face
  as she cried, staring at him.'
- ! '"Amy, it''s not his fault," Jenny reminded her, and Amy only stared at the Doctor.'
- ! '"I know," she finally replied before turning away and Rory hurried after her
  as she sobbed.'
- ! '"Doctor," Vastra called, drawing his attention to her where she stood past Rory
  and Amy.'
- ! '"There''s someone who wants to speak to you.'
- She came to warn us."
- ! '"Hey, hello," he smiled when Lorna stirred and looked to him.'
- ! '"Doctor," she breathed.'
- ! '"You helped my friends," he still smiled.'
- ! '"Thank you."'
- ! '"I met you once…" she whispered, weakly before wheezing in a breath.'
- ! '"In the Gamma Forests.'
- You don't remember me."
- ! '"Hey, of course I remember," he assured her, shifting forward to gently cup her
  face in his hands, still smiling sadly as he saw tears running down her cheeks.'
- ! '"I remember everyone.'
- Didn't we run, Lorna?"
- ! '"Who was she?"'
- ! '"I don''t know, but she was very brave," Vastra replied, sadly.'
- ! '"We''re always brave," Olivia murmured, making him look to her and she could
  see it in his eyes…he''d fallen to as far as River had said he would.'
- ! '"So what now?"'
- ! '"They''d almost certainly have taken her to Earth, raise her in the correct environment."'
- ! '"Yes, they did, and it''s already too late," he replied, grabbing Olivia''s hand
  to pull her back toward the TARDIS as she frowned at him, incredulously.'
- ! '"You''re giving up?"'
- ! '"You never give up!"'
- ! '"Yeah, and don''t you sometimes wish I did?"'
- ! '"Never," she breathed without hesitation.'
- ! '"It wouldn''t be you if you did that."'
- ! '"Sometimes…I wish I would," he murmured.'
- ! '"Well, then, soldier, how goes the day?"'
- ! '"Where the hell have you been?"'
- ! '"Every time you''ve asked I have been there.'
- Where the hell were you today?"
- ! '"I couldn''t have prevented this," she replied.'
- ! '"You could''ve tried," he growled.'
- ! '"And so, my love, could you," she told him, calmly before looking to Rory and
  Amy.'
- ! '"I know you''re not alright, but hold tight, Amy, because you''re going to be."'
- ! '"You think I wanted this?"'
- ! '"I didn''t do this!'
- This wasn't me!"
- ! '"This was exactly you," River retorted.'
- ! '"All this, all of it.'
- But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?"
- ! '"In the Gamma Forests, ''Doctor'' means…''Mighty Warrior''," Olivia recalled
  as River stepped around him, making him turn to see both of them staring intently
  at him.'
- ! '"How far you''ve come," River resumed.'
- ! '"And now they''ve taken a child, the child of yours best friends, and they''re
  going to turn her into a weapon just to bring you down.'
- And all this, my love, in fear of you."
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"Oh, look, your cot!'
- Haven't seen that in a very long while," she smiled, backing up toward it, the Doctor
  following her steps and grabbing her hands as Olivia stepped up to the cot where
  they stopped.
- ! '"No, no, you tell me.'
- You tell me who you are."
- ! '"I am telling you," she insisted, taking his hand from her wrist to place it
  on the cot, making him look at it before she asked, "Can''t you read?"'
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"Hello," River smiled back, making him giggle before Olivia hugged her tightly,
  not letting her go, even as she and the Doctor spoke.'
- ! '"But…but that means—"'
- ! '"I''m afraid it does," River finished with a grin when he cut himself off and
  he looked back at Rory and Amy before looking back at her as Olivia released her.'
- ! '"Ooh, but you and I, we, we, we, we, uh—"'
- ! '"Yes," River hummed, making the Doctor giggle again before looking at Rory and
  Amy in worry then looking back at her to straighten his bowtie.'
- ! '"How do I look, girls?"'
- ! '"Amazing," River grinned.'
- ! '"Agreed," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"I''d better be," he retorted.'
- ! '"Yes, you''d better be," River nodded before he twirled around.'
- ! '"Vastra and Jenny, till the next time," he told them then turned to Rory and
  Amy.'
- ! '"Rory and Amy, I know where to find your daughter, and on my life she will be
  safe.'
- Come along, Felton."
- ! '"Where are you going?!"'
- ! '"Incredible!"'
- ! '"Amazing!"'
- ! '"Mind blowing!"'
- ! '"Unexpected."'
- ! '"That was a twist I did not see coming."'
- ! '"Oh, by the way, how did you know about the Gamma Forests?"'
- ! '"I met someone from there when I was at Torchwood," Olivia replied, heading toward
  the scanner.'
- ! '"She told me all about it.'
- There was even a book on it."
- ! '"Of course.'
- Should've known," he murmured, concentrating on flying.
- They worked in silence for a moment before the Doctor asked, "I have…several questions."
- ! '"And for once, I don''t," she smirked back at him.'
- ! '"River told you what would happen, didn''t she?"'
- ! '"She was her usual, vague self at the time, but…she told me you''d rise higher
  than you''ve ever been and fall much further."'
- ! '"What else did she say?"'
- ! '"Just to be there for you when she couldn''t."'
- ! '"So…are you happy about my decision?"'
- ! '"Yes," she smiled then giggled when he nuzzled her cheek.'
- ! '"One more question."'
- ! '"Hm?"'
- ! '"If you saw my older version be killed in America…where was the older version
  of you?"'
- ! '"Believe me, I''d feel a whole lot better if I knew the answer to that, too."'
- ! '"Because if I wasn''t there…does that mean—?"'
- ! '"Stop, Liv.'
- I know what you're thinking and you know I'd never let that happen."
- ! '"What if you can''t stop it?"'
- ! '"Stop."'
- ! '"I''m sorry," she whispered, turning in his arms again to work on the console.'
- ! '"We should be looking for Melody."'
- ! '"We know where to find her," he replied, pulling her back from the console by
  her waist and she squeaked in surprise as she tried to make a grab for it again,
  but he spun her around by her waist as she still faced away from him.'
- ! '"We''ve got time.'
- It's a time machine."
- ! '"You keep saying that, but then you get distracted or you get a date wrong and
  before you know it, twelve years have gone by," Olivia retorted, giving a shout
  when he twirled her around to face him.'
- ! '"But this is like old times now," he smirked, leaving an Eskimo kiss to her nose
  and making her giggle.'
- ! '"You and me in the TARDIS.'
- Anything could happen."
- ! '"Anything has happened in every room of the TARDIS," she smirked back.'
- ! '"Oh, Olivia Felton," he smirked.'
- ! '"Not nearly."'
- ! '"Bad boy!"'
- ! '"We have to find Melody!'
- Get off!"
- ! '"Wait!'
- We have to dance!"
- ! '"Well, it''s a marvelous night a moondance, isn''t it, Liv?"'
- ! '"It must be," she smirked before crying out in delight when he started dancing
  her around the console.'
- ! '"So…you saying you didn''t have children yet…does that mean now is the right
  time for you and me to bring a little Sigma into the universe?"'
- ! '"It''ll be a little Felton, Liv," he replied, making her frown in wonder as they
  still danced but now a bit slower to speak.'
- ! '"It''ll have to be fully human.'
- That's the only way it could work."
- ! '"But…Melody is part Time Lord," she reminded him.'
- ! '"Why can''t ours be?"'
- ! '"That was different.'
- The DNA is all wrong."
- ! '"But you said my DNA is tweaked.'
- Doesn't that mean it could work?"
- ! '"Not tweaked enough, darling.'
- Fully human is the only way to go."
- ! '"Ok," she nodded.'
- ! '"But how would we do it?"'
- ! '"I''m working it out," he assured her.'
- ! '"I have an idea that needs to be sorted through.'
- What do you say?"
- ! '"Well, how can I say no to that?"'
- ! '"I love you, Theta."'
- ! '"I love you, too, Liv."'
- ! '"Who''s ringing you?"'
- ! '"Amy," she replied.'
- ! '"Who else?'
- She's been calling the TARDIS phone, too, ya know?"
- ! '"I never answer my phone while driving," he replied as she went to the scanner
  to examine it.'
- ! '"Three months now, and we haven''t found her," Olivia reminded him.'
- ! '"Amy''s gonna be mad at you."'
- ! '"That might be another reason why I haven''t answered my phone," he muttered
  as she frowned at the scanner.'
- ! '"Hey, were there ever any crop circles in Leadworth?"'
- ! '"No, why?"'
- ! '"Because this one''s got your name written all over it…quite literally."'
- ! '"Back to Leadworth.'
- Let's see what they want."
- ! '"Allons-y!"'
- ! '"Seriously?"'
- ! '"A crop circle that spelled his name?"'
- Olivia added, then asked again, "Really?"
- ! '"Well, you never answer your phone," Rory retorted, he and Amy shutting their
  doors and heading toward them.'
- ! '"Either of you."'
- ! '"Ok, you''ve have all summer," Amy said.'
- ! '"Have you found her?'
- Have you found Melody?"
- ! '"Permission?"'
- ! '"Granted," he replied.'
- ! '"Wife?"'
- ! '"Agreed," she permitted, stepping toward Rory to hug him as the Doctor hugged
  Amy to speak to her.'
- ! '"You know who she grows up to be," he recalled.'
- ! '"So you know I will find her."'
- ! '"But you haven''t yet?"'
- ! '"Hang on," Rory muttered, making Olivia frown at him in wonder as they looked
  at the newspaper.'
- ! '"What''s this bit?"'
- ! '"That wasn''t us," Amy recalled.'
- ! '"You said he was funny," she smirked down at him.'
- ! '"You never said he was hot."'
- ! '"Mels!"'
- ! '"Who?!"'
- ! '"What are you doing here?"'
- ! '"Following you.'
- What do you think?"
- ! '"Um, where did you get the car?"'
- ! '"It''s mine," Mels shrugged as Olivia tried pulling herself out from between
  the two vehicles but remained stuck.'
- They all stared into the distance when they heard sirens and Mels added, "Ish."
- ! '"Oh, Mels, not again," Amy muttered.'
- ! '"You can''t keep doing this," Rory scolded.'
- ! '"You''re gonna end up in prison."'
- ! '"Sorry," the Doctor called, glancing between them and saying hello to Mels before
  adding, "Doctor not following this.'
- You never said I was hot?"
- ! '"Really?"'
- ! '"That''s your question?!"'
- ! '"Is that the phone box?"'
- ! '"The ''bigger on the inside'' phone box."'
- ! '"Oh, time travel.'
- I'm their best mate."
- ! '"Then why don''t we know you?"'
- ! '"Yeah, I danced with everyone at the wedding," the Doctor added.'
- ! '"The women were all brilliant.'
- The men were a bit…shy."
- ! '"I don''t do weddings," Mels replied, stepping away from the TARDIS as the sirens
  came closer.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"And that''s me, out of time," Mels sighed just as the Doctor pulled Olivia out
  of her spot.'
- ! '"Mels!"'
- ! '"For God''s sake!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"I need out of here, now," Mels explained to them before looking to the Doctor
  and Olivia.'
- ! '"Anywhere in particular?"'
- ! '"Well, let''s see," Mels mused.'
- ! '"You''ve got a time machine, I''ve got a gun.'
- Let's kill Hitler."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Did she just say—?"'
- ! '"She''s got a gun, Liv, let''s just get in the TARDIS, eh?"'
- ! '"You''ll go up against a room full of guns, but you''re scared of a little girl
  with a gun?"'
- ! '"Oh, just…shut up and get in the TARDIS!"'
- ! '"Whoa," Mels breathed as she walked in and stared wide eyes around the control
  room.'
- ! '"This place is…brilliant!"'
- ! '"Yeah, so would you mind putting the gun away, crazy lady?"'
- ! '"Someone''s at that time of the month, eh?"'
- ! '"Won''t matter anyway," the Doctor cut in, seeing Olivia''s glare burning at
  Mels and hurried to her side to place his hands on her shoulders to calm her as
  he continued, "The interior is in a state of temporal grace.'
- Guns don't work."
- ! '"State of temporal grace?"'
- ! '"Really?"'
- ! '"Mels!'
- No!"
- ! '"You shot it!"'
- ! '"You shot my TARDIS!"'
- ! '"You shot the console, you twit!"'
- ! '"It''s his fault!"'
- ! '"How is it my fault?!"'
- ! '"You said guns didn''t work in this place!"'
- ! '"You said we''re in a state of temporal grace!"'
- ! '"That was a clever line, you idiot!"'
- ! '"Anyone could tell that was a clever line!"'
- ! '"Where are we?!"'
- ! '"That''s the question of the day, Amy!"'
- ! '"Doctor—!"'
- ! '"I know—!"'
- ! '"Out, out, out!"'
- ! '"Everybody out!'
- Just get out!"
- ! '"Where are we?!"'
- ! '"A room!"'
- ! '"Well, what room?!"'
- ! '"I don''t know what room," the Doctor retorted as Olivia noticed Mels nearing
  the TARDIS.'
- ! '"I haven''t memorized every room in the universe yet.'
- I had yesterday off."
- ! '"Mels!'
- Get away!"
- ! '"Bad smoke," the Doctor called, shutting the door.'
- ! '"Don''t breathe the bad, bad smoke!'
- Bad, deadly smoke, because somebody shot my TARDIS!"
- ! '"Doctor, this guy, I think he''s hurt," Rory called, examining him as the Doctor
  stepped toward him, Olivia frowning when she noticed his uniform and not going near
  him when she recognized it.'
- ! '"No, hang on.'
- No, he's fine."
- ! '"Liv!'
- Why do have a gun?!"
- ! '"Ooh!'
- Hello!"
- ! '"Sorry, is this your office?"'
- ! '"Doctor," Olivia called as Amy and Rory stood to head toward them, Mels remaining
  on the other side of the room.'
- ! '"Had a sort of collision with my…vehicle," the Doctor explained as the man stood
  tall and they all looked to him.'
- ! '"Faults on both sides.'
- Let's say no more about…" He trailed off when the man turned and straightened himself
  out, making Olivia swallow and Amy gasped as the Doctor resumed, "…it."
- ! '"Is that…?"'
- ! '"No, it can''t be, Doctor?"'
- ! '"Thank you, whoever you are," Hitler nodded as Olivia''s jaw dropped.'
- ! '"I think you have just saved my life."'
- ! '"Believe me," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"It was an accident."'
- They all watched him look to the TARDIS before stepping toward it, asking, "What
  is this thing?"
- ! '"What did he mean, we just saved his life?"'
- ! '"We could not have just saved Hitler."'
- The Doctor gritted his teeth before whirling around to glare at Mels, snapping,
  "You see?
- It never goes to plan."
- ! '"Darling, while I do enjoy the fact that you are more angry at this girl than
  attracted to her, need I remind you that Hitler is near the TARDIS?"'
- ! '"This box," Hitler began.'
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"It''s a police telephone box from London, England," the Doctor replied, glaring
  at him as Olivia watched him closely.'
- ! '"That''s right, Adolf.'
- The British are coming."
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Look out!"
- ! '"No!'
- Stop him!"
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Sit still, shut up," Rory ordered, cocking the gun as Amy tried to help the
  man that had been shot at, and Olivia stared up at Mels who''d shoved her to the
  ground.'
- ! '"Are you ok?"'
- ! '"Yes, yes I''m fine," he replied as Olivia stood, still watching Mels.'
- ! '"I think he missed."'
- ! '"He was going to kill me!"'
- ! '"Shut up, Hitler!"'
- ! '"Rory, take Hitler and put him in that cupboard over there," the Doctor ordered,
  gesturing to the closet he spoke of.'
- ! '"Now, do it."'
- ! '"Right…putting Hitler in the cupboard," Rory muttered, lifting the gun away from
  him and taking his arm to pull him toward the cupboard.'
- ! '"Mels?"'
- ! '"Hitler," she breathed.'
- ! '"What about him?"'
- ! '"Lousy shot," Mels blurted before her knees gave out and Olivia caught her to
  help lower her to the piece of wall the TARDIS had blown into the room.'
- ! '"Mels!"'
- ! '"We gotta stop the bleeding," Rory instructed, trying to examine her.'
- ! '"How bad is it, Rory?"'
- ! '"What can we do?"'
- ! '"Just keep her conscious," he instructed.'
- ! '"Stay with us, Mels!"'
- ! '"Hey, look at me," the Doctor told her when it looked like she was ready to pass
  out and she looked up at him.'
- ! '"Just hold on."'
- ! '"I used to dream about you," Mels panted through a weak smile.'
- ! '"All those stories Amy used to tell me."'
- ! '"What stories?"'
- ! '"Tell me what stories.'
- Vampires in Venice, that's a belter."
- ! '"When I was…little," she breathed.'
- ! '"I was gonna marry you."'
- ! '"Good idea.'
- Deal?"
- ! '"Shouldn''t you ask my parents'' permission?"'
- ! '"As soon as you''re well, I''ll get them on the phone."'
- ! '"Might as well do it now.'
- Since they're right here."
- ! '"Penny in the air," Mels murmured before lifting her hands as they emitted a
  familiar golden glow.'
- ! '"Penny drops."'
- ! '"What the hell is going on?"'
- ! '"Get back!"'
- ! '"We need to get back!'
- Now!"
- ! '"Last time I did this I ended up a toddler in the middle of New York," Mels recalled
  as the glow intensified.'
- ! '"Ok, Doctor, Olivia, explain what''s happening, please," Amy demanded.'
- ! '"What''s Mels short for?"'
- ! '"Melody," Mels nodded.'
- ! '"Yeah, I named my daughter after her," Amy confirmed.'
- ! '"You named your daughter…after your daughter," the Doctor guessed as they all
  kept their eyes on Mels on the other side of the room.'
- ! '"It took me years to find you two," Mels breathed.'
- ! '"I''m so glad I did.'
- You got to raise me after all."
- ! '"You''re Melody?"'
- ! '"But is she''s Melody, that means that she''s also—"'
- ! '"Oh, shut up, dad," Mels strained, cutting Rory off.'
- ! '"I''m focusing on a dress size."'
- ! '"No…" she breathed, making the Doctor look up at her, but he hadn''t heard her.'
- ! '"No, not again."'
- ! '"Right, let''s see then," River sighed as Amy, Rory and the Doctor turned to
  look at her, Olivia staring at her in awe as she examined herself.'
- ! '"Ooh!'
- It's all going on down there, isn't it?"
- ! '"The hair!"'
- ! '"The hair!'
- I love it!"
- She spun around and smirked that familiar smirk as she added, "I'm all sort of…mature."
- ! '"What…the…hell?"'
- ! '"Hello, Benjamin," River smirked, lifting a leg to lean it on the overturned
  couch next to her, but Olivia noticed her other hand duck behind the arm of the
  chair on the other side of her.'
- ! '"Who''s Benjamin?"'
- ! '"The teeth.'
- The teeth, the teeth," she breathed, touching her teeth before turning and running
  toward the Doctor, pinning him between herself and the desk and Olivia couldn't
  keep her glare from burning a hole in River's head.
- ! '"Oh, look at them!'
- Watch out, that bowtie."
- ! '"My bowtie for the moment," Olivia ground out as River turned around, but kept
  the Doctor pinned on the desk.'
- ! '"Excuse me, you lot.'
- I need to weigh myself," River said, glancing between the three before running toward
  the door on the right and Olivia didn't fail to notice the Doctor first cross his
  legs then uncross them and place his hands in his lap as Rory and Amy sat on either
  side of him.
- ! '"That''s…Melody," Amy blurted, still in shock.'
- ! '"It''s River Song," Rory added.'
- ! '"Who''s River Song?"'
- ! '"Spoilers," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"Spoilers?"'
- ! '"What spoilers?'
- Hang on…just something I have to check."
- ! '"Does anybody else find this day just a bit difficult?"'
- ! '"I''m getting a sort of banging in my head."'
- ! '"Yeah, I think that''s Hitler in the cupboard," Amy replied.'
- ! '"That''s not helping," he retorted.'
- ! '"Hitler in a cupboard…that''s funny," Olivia snickered.'
- ! '"This isn''t the River Song we know, yet," the Doctor reminded them, as they
  all stood in unison and Olivia stepped next to him as they all began pacing with
  him.'
- ! '"This is her, right at the start.'
- She doesn't even know her name."
- ! '"Oh!'
- That's magnificent!"
- River called, making them all turn, warily just as she reentered the room, grinning,
  "I'm gonna wear lots of jumpers."
- ! '"Oh, that''s definitely her," Olivia muttered.'
- ! '"Well, now, enough of all that," River said, pulling Hitler''s gun from behind
  her back and aiming it at the Doctor, casually adding, "Down to business."'
- ! '"Oh, hello," the Doctor greeted as Amy and Rory stared on in confusion and Olivia
  reached into her jacket for her Sonic.'
- ! '"I thought we were getting married."'
- ! '"I told you, I''m not a wedding person," River replied, stepping toward the desk
  to stand directly in front of the group, still aiming her gun at them.'
- ! '"Doctor, what is she doing?"'
- ! '"What she''s programmed to," the Doctor replied, calmly.'
- ! '"And where did she get the gun?"'
- ! '"Hello, Benjamin," Olivia realized, recalling her hand ducking behind the arm
  of the chair she''d been standing near.'
- ! '"You noticed," River smirked before pulling the trigger several times, but nothing
  happened as Amy and Rory ducked, the Doctor and Olivia only watching her.'
- ! '"I noticed, too," the Doctor smirked, and Olivia realized he must have unloaded
  the gun at some point.'
- ! '"As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit."'
- ! '"I know you did," she smirked, reaching into her vest, presumably for the second
  gun she''d brought with her.'
- ! '"I know you know," he retorted as he stepped closer to her and she pulled out
  a banana to aim it at him instead of the gun, still in the fruit bowl.'
- ! '"Goodness, is killing you going to take all day?"'
- ! '"Why?'
- Are you busy?"
- ! '"Oh, I''m not complaining," River retorted, whirling around to grab the letter
  opener on the desk, but when she turned back Olivia stepped forward and aimed her
  Sonic at River''s hand, sending the letter opener out of it as it sparked with its
  hum.'
- ! '"If you were in such a hurry why didn''t you try to kill him in the cornfield?"'
- ! '"We''d only just met," River replied, turning to the desk again as the Doctor
  walked back toward Amy and Rory as they watched the scene and Olivia remained where
  she was.'
- ! '"I''m a psychopath.'
- I'm not rude."
- ! '"You are not a psychopath!"'
- ! '"Why would she be a psychopath?"'
- ! '"Oh, mummy, mummy, pay attention," River replied, dropping the useless gun and
  circling the Doctor as he circled her in return.'
- ! '"I was trained and conditioned for one purpose: I was born to kill the Doctor."'
- ! '"Demons Run," the Doctor reminded Amy.'
- ! '"Remember?'
- This is what they were building…my bespoke psychopath."
- ! '"I''m all yours, Sweetie," River murmured, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.'
- ! '"Only River Song gets to call me that," he replied.'
- ! '"And who''s River Song?"'
- ! '"An old friend of mine."'
- ! '"Stupid name," River retorted, turning toward the window they''d crashed through
  and stepping toward it, grabbing Olivia''s arm on the way.'
- ! '"What—?!"'
- ! '"Look at that," River gasped, climbing up to the sill, still gripping Olivia''s
  arm, and she struggled as the Doctor moved closer to the both of them.'
- ! '"Berlin, on the eve of war.'
- A whole world about to tear itself apart."
- ! '"Now that''s my kind of town."'
- ! '"Let her go," the Doctor warned as River turned to the three.'
- ! '"Mum, dad, don''t follow me and, yes, that is a warning," she told them, ignoring
  the Doctor''s call.'
- ! '"What about me?"'
- ! '"You''re coming with me, darling," River smirked.'
- ! '"Designated hostage."'
- ! '"No warning for me, then?"'
- ! '"No need, my love," River replied.'
- ! '"The deed is done…and so are you."'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Get off me!"'
- ! '"What have you done?"'
- ! '"River."'
- ! '"Oh, ''River, River, River,''" River groaned.'
- ! '"More than a friend, I think."'
- She looked to Olivia, adding, "Too bad for you."
- ! '"What have you done to him?!"'
- ! '"It was never going to be a gun for you, Doctor," River replied.'
- ! '"The man of peace, who understands every kind of warfare except, perhaps, the
  cruelest."'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Kiss, kiss," River mocked, blowing him a kiss as he strained against the poison
  now running through his veins.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Hello, boys," River grinned, stopping in front of them.'
- ! '"What are you doing here?"'
- ! '"Well, we were on our way to this gay, gypsy bar mitzvah for the disabled when
  I suddenly thought, ''Gosh, the Third Reich''s a bit rubbish.'
- I think I'll kill the Fuehrer.'" River retorted, making Olivia stare at her in wide-eyed
  shock before looking back at the group of soldiers.
- ! '"Who''s with me?"'
- ! '"Shoot them," the high-ranking officer ordered, lowering his gun and stepping
  behind his men.'
- ! '"Tip for you all," River smirked.'
- ! '"Never shoot a girl while she''s regenerating."'
- ! '"Now that hit the spot," River smirked as she grabbed their guns and slung them
  over her shoulders, giving Olivia two of them as well as she pulled her toward one
  of the motorbikes.'
- ! '"You''re driving.'
- Call us!"
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"New body, new town…we''re going shopping," she replied before Olivia revved
  the engine and drove off.'
- ! '"Where the hell are we going?!"'
- ! '"Keep going straight!"'
- ! '"I''ll tell you when to stop!"'
- ! '"Ladies and gentlemen, I don''t have a thing to wear," River called as Olivia
  stood, stunned next to her before she aimed the guns at everyone in the room, ordering,
  "Take off your clothes."'
- ! '"What?'
- You want my clothes, too?"
- ! '"Oh, no, dear," River smirked, shaking her head.'
- ! '"I just don''t want you to try anything.'
- Step ahead of me and pick your seat, then lower your guns so I can try on clothes."
- ! '"I''m not gonna do anything," Olivia retorted, stepping ahead to find a seat,
  stopping herself from calling her River.'
- ! '"Hmm, now look at that," River smiled, examining an outfit she''d put on.'
- ! '"Now that''s fun.'
- From every angle."
- ! '"Why don''t you try something on?"'
- ! '"Shopping always does me a world of good."'
- ! '"This isn''t shopping," Olivia retorted, glaring at her through the mirror before
  standing and stepping up behind her, crossing her arms.'
- ! '"You know what does me a world of good though?'
- Answers."
- ! '"Oh, haven''t you figured out everything already?"'
- ! '"Not why you took me as a hostage," Olivia retorted, starting to pace behind
  her.'
- ! '"Or why you saved me…twice, after knowing who I was.'
- I'm the Doctor's companion, why would you save my life?"
- ! '"Which question should I answer first?"'
- ! '"What are you playing at, Melody?"'
- ! '"You didn''t need a hostage, why''d you drag me with you?"'
- ! '"Ok, why''d you save me from being shot?"'
- ! '"Look, I was, for lack of a better word, a bitch to you as soon as you drove
  up in that car.'
- Why are you being so nice to me?"
- ! '"Alright, I''ll be honest with you," River nodded.'
- ! '"I feel we have a connection of some kind.'
- Just let me get some new clothes and we'll get to know each other a bit better."
- ! '"Now, dear, I told you not to follow me," River recalled as Olivia hurried toward
  her with a grin.'
- ! '"Amy!'
- Is the Doctor alright?"
- ! '"Amy?"'
- ! '"I might take the age down a little," River reported, pulling on an officer''s
  jacket and adjusting it.'
- ! '"Just gradually…to freak people out."'
- ! '"You killed the Doctor," Amy said with a straight face in a monotone, making
  Olivia''s frown deepen at her.'
- ! '"Oh, yes, I know, dear," River sighed.'
- ! '"I hope you''re not gonna keep on about it.'
- Ooh, regeneration…it's a whole new coloring to work with."
- ! '"You killed the Doctor on the orders of the movement known as the Silence, an
  Academy of the Question," Amy continued making Olivia''s frown return, something
  wasn''t right.'
- ! '"You accept and know this to be true?"'
- ! '"Quite honestly, I don''t really remember," River retorted, still looking in
  the mirror.'
- ! '"It was all a bit of a jumble."'
- ! '"Get off me!"'
- ! '"Sorry, did you say she killed the Doctor?"'
- ! '"The Doctor?"'
- he repeated as they all stared at him in astonishment and he looked to them, asking,
  "Doctor who?"
- ! '"You''re dying, and you stopped to change?"'
- ! '"Of course he did!"'
- ! '"Oh, you should always waste time when you don''t have any," the Doctor smirked,
  standing and heading toward the stairs he was parked at the top of as Olivia hurried
  toward him, throwing her arms around his neck.'
- ! '"Time is not the boss of you, is it, Liv?'
- Rule four hundred and eight."
- ! '"Amelia Pond, judgment death machine," he realized.'
- ! '"Why am I not surprised?"'
- ! '"Yeah, I''m…not surprised either," Olivia retorted as he released her hand to
  lift his cane and he grinned at her.'
- ! '"Sonic Cane," he grinned at Olivia, making her giggle.'
- ! '"Are you serious?"'
- ! '"Never knowingly," he replied, pointing his cane at Robot Amy.'
- ! '"Never knowingly be serious.'
- You might want to write these down."
- He looked to the results on his Sonic Cane before announcing, "Oh, it's a robot!
- Love it, Liv?"
- ! '"Love it," she smirked back.'
- ! '"But how did you all get in there, though?'
- Bigger on the inside?"
- ! '"No, basic miniaturization sustained by a compression field.'
- It'll get you every time."
- ! '"Amy, if you and Rory are ok, signal me," he called before looking to his cane,
  obviously getting the signal and smiled, "Thanking you."'
- ! '"Doctor—?!"'
- ! '"I''m so sorry!"'
- ! '"Leg went to sleep.'
- I think I heard the right one yawning."
- ! '"Oh, you''re an idiot," Olivia ground out, sitting next to him and using her
  Sonic to scan him, but shot her gaze to River when she bolted toward the exit on
  the other side of the room.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Don''t you touch her!'
- Do not harm her in any way!"
- ! '"Why would you care?"'
- ! '"She''s the woman who kills you."'
- ! '"I''m not dead," the Doctor grinned, lifting his top hat and placing it on the
  floor.'
- ! '"You''re dying."'
- ! '"Well, at least I''m not a time-traveling, shapeshifting robot operated by miniaturized,
  cross people, which, I have got to admit, I didn''t see coming."'
- ! '"What do you want with her?"'
- ! '"She''s Melody Pond.'
- According to our records, the woman who kills the Doctor."
- ! '"And I''m the Doctor, so what''s it gotta do with you?"'
- ! '"Throughout history, many criminals have gone unpunished in their lifetimes.'
- Time travel has…responsibilities."
- ! '"So you''re able to time travel and now you''ve decided to punish dead people?"'
- ! '"We don''t kill them, we extract them near the end of their established timelines."'
- ! '"Yeah?'
- And do what?"
- ! '"Give them hell."'
- ! '"I''d ask who you think you are, but I think the answer is pretty obvious," the
  Doctor said, and Olivia recognized his tone as she looked back to the Amy-bot.'
- ! '"So who do you think I am?'
- I'd love a peek."
- ! '"Our records office is sealed to the public.'
- Foreknowledge is dangerous."
- ! '"As so demonstrated," Olivia ground out.'
- ! '"Yeah, well, I''ll be dead in three minutes.'
- There isn't much foreknowledge left."
- ! '"Sorry, can''t do that."'
- ! '"Governments never change," Olivia growled, sitting herself next to the Doctor.'
- ! '"You alright, Liv?"'
- ! '"Don''t worry about me," she muttered.'
- ! '"Worry about you."'
- ! '"Records available," Amy-bot suddenly said, making them both look at her and
  Olivia helped him stand as he used his cane as well.'
- ! '"Question," he strained as Olivia ducked under one of his arms to steady him.'
- ! '"I''m dying.'
- Who wants me dead?"
- ! '"The Silence."'
- ! '"What is the Silence?'
- W-What does it mean?"
- ! '"The Silence is not a species.'
- Their core belief is that Silence will fall when the question is asked."
- ! '"What question?"'
- ! '"The first question, the oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight."'
- ! '"Yes, but what is the question?"'
- ! '"Unknown."'
- ! '"Oh, well, fat lot of use that is, you big ginge.'
- Agh!"
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"The kidneys are always the first to quit!'
- I've had better, you know."
- ! '"Doctor, please!"'
- ! '"No!'
- Stop it!"
- ! '"Amy, Rory," the Doctor strained.'
- ! '"Can you hear me?"'
- ! '"What do we do?"'
- ! '"This is me.'
- What do we do?"
- ! '"Just stop them," the Doctor strained as River still groaned and shook in the
  pain they were inflicting on her.'
- ! '"She''s your daughter.'
- Just stop them."
- ! '"How?'
- How?"
- ! '"Just do it, Amy!"'
- ! '"You can stop them!'
- Do it!"
- ! '"I''ve got you," she whispered.'
- ! '"We have to save your parents."'
- ! '"Don''t run," the Doctor called, making them both look to him as he struggled
  on the floor.'
- ! '"I know you''re scared.'
- But never run when you're scared…Rule seven."
- ! '"Doctor, can you hear us?"'
- ! '"Doctor.'
- Doctor, please!"
- ! '"Get me…to the TARDIS, Liv," he strained, trying to stand.'
- ! '"Arm around my neck," she instructed, and he draped his arm over her neck to
  help him toward the stairs leading to the blue box.'
- ! '"Stairs.'
- Lift your foot."
- ! '"Look at you two," River murmured, watching them from her chair.'
- ! '"You still care.'
- It's impressive, I'll give you that."
- ! '"River," the Doctor groaned as Olivia tried to help him up the stairs.'
- ! '"Please."'
- ! '"Again!"'
- ! '"Who is this River?'
- Olivia?"
- ! '"Please, just help us save them," Olivia insisted, trying to pull the Doctor
  up the stairs he was sprawled out on.'
- ! '"Tell me about her," River requested.'
- ! '"Go on."'
- ! '"Olivia, go!"'
- ! '"I can''t fly it alone.'
- We need your help."
- ! '"I can''t fly her," River objected, making Olivia smile, warmly.'
- ! '"You''re the child of the TARDIS.'
- Of course you can."
- ! '"Theta?'
- Don't you dare die on me yet or I'll kill you, understand?"
- ! '"For luck," he breathed and she swallowed back a sob before rushing to the TARDIS,
  shutting the door behind her and running to the console where River stood, starting
  the engines.'
- ! '"How am I able to do this?"'
- ! '"I don''t understand."'
- ! '"I''ll explain it after we get your parents," Olivia replied, slamming a lever
  down as River operated a part of the console that blocked her from the door.'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- Olivia smiled at them as Amy breathed, "You did it!
- Where's the Doctor?"
- ! '"I seem to able to fly her," River explained.'
- ! '"She showed me how.'
- Olivia says I'm the child of the TARDIS."
- ! '"What do you mean?"'
- ! '"It means exactly what you think it does," Olivia replied, turning back to the
  console.'
- ! '"Now let''s get back to the Doctor."'
- ! '"You can''t die now," Amy murmured, smirking, "I know you don''t die now."'
- ! '"Oh, Pond, you''ve got a schedule for everything," he muttered.'
- ! '"It doesn''t make any sense," she insisted.'
- ! '"Doctor, what do we do?'
- Come on," Rory asked.
- ! '"How do we help?"'
- ! '"Oh, I''m sorry, Rory, you can''t," he breathed, making Olivia let out a sob.'
- ! '"Nobody can.'
- I need to talk to your daughter."
- ! '"I love you, Olivia Felton," he whispered so low that only she could hear him
  and a tear ran down her cheek as she nodded.'
- ! '"You too, Theta Sigma," she whispered back before he released her wrist and River
  knelt next to him just as she stood to stand with Rory and Amy.'
- ! '"Find her," the Doctor breathed.'
- ! '"Find River Song and tell her something for me."'
- ! '"Tell her what?"'
- She smiled before pulling back to say, "Well I'm sure she knows."
- ! '"Who''s River Song?"'
- ! '"Are you still working because I''m still a relative?"'
- Amy asked it before ordering, "Access files on River Song."
- ! '"Records available," Amy-bot replied.'
- ! '"Show me her," Amy ordered.'
- ! '"Show me River Song."'
- ! '"What did he say?"'
- ! '"What was his message?"'
- ! '"What''s happening?"'
- ! '"River, what are you doing?"'
- ! '"Just tell me," River replied, not looking back at them and still approaching
  the Doctor.'
- ! '"The Doctor…is he worth it?"'
- ! '"Yes," Olivia breathed.'
- ! '"God, yes…he is."'
- ! '"River," he breathed, staring wide eyes at her.'
- ! '"No.'
- What are you doing?"
- ! '"Hello, Sweetie," River grinned before pressing her lips to his.'
- ! '"Hey," Amy smiled down at her.'
- ! '"Hey," River replied weakly, clapping her lips before asking, "Where am I?"'
- ! '"You''re safe now," Amy assured her.'
- ! '"Apparently, you used all your regenerations in one go.'
- You shouldn't have done that."
- ! '"Mother…I had to try," River insisted, still weak.'
- ! '"I know," Amy smiled.'
- ! '"He said no one could save him…but he must have known I could."'
- ! '"Rule 1:" the Doctor chimed in, drawing everyone''s attention to him as he stood
  next to the window with Olivia.'
- ! '"The Doctor lies."'
- ! '"She just needs to rest," the nurse in the room with them assured them all when
  River drifted off to sleep.'
- ! '"She''ll be absolutely fine."'
- The Doctor stepped toward her bedside table to set a blue diary on it as Olivia
  smiled, "No…she'll be amazing."
- ! '"So that''s it, we just leave her there?"'
- ! '"The Sisters of the Infinite Schism," the Doctor reminded them.'
- ! '"Greatest hospital in the universe."'
- ! '"Yeah, but she''s our daughter, Doctor," Amy reminded him.'
- ! '"She''s River and she''s our daughter."'
- ! '"Amy, I know," he replied.'
- ! '"But we have to let her make her own way now.'
- We have too much foreknowledge, it's…a dangerous thing…foreknowledge."
- ! '"What''s that?"'
- ! '"Nothing," he lied, flipping a switch to turn the screen off and Olivia gave
  a silent sigh of exasperation before stepping away again.'
- ! '"Just some data I downloaded from the Teselecta.'
- Very boring."
- ! '"Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you, right?"'
- ! '"She did kill him…and then she used however many lives she had left to save him,"
  Olivia summarized.'
- ! '"As first dates go, I''d say that was mixed signals," the Doctor chimed in.'
- ! '"But…that stuff that they put in her head, is that gone now?"'
- ! '"The River that we know in the future…she is in prison for murder."'
- ! '"Whose murder?"'
- ! '"Will we see her again?"'
- ! '"Oh, she''ll come looking for us," he replied, grabbing Olivia''s hand and dragging
  her up the stairs leading deeper into the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Yeah, but how?"'
- ! '"How do people even look for you?"'
- ! '"Oh, Pond, haven''t you figured that one out yet?"'
- ! '"I figured it out!"'
- ! '"Did you, Liv?"'
- ! '"Tell me."'
- ! '"Archeology," she whispered back.'
- ! '"You''re not half clever, Felton," he smirked.'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"What—?!"'
- ! '"That''s for dying…again!"'
- ! '"And that''s for making River use all her regenerations."'
- ! '"Liv, please—"'
- ! '"And that''s for anything stupid you might do later!"'
- ! '"Now, Olivia, you have to stop punching me," he murmured.'
- ! '"You hit me hard enough I might regenerate."'
- ! '"Liv?"'
- ! '"Don''t," she breathed, making his frown deepen before she pulled her wrists
  from his grip.'
- ! '"Don''t…even go there."'
- ! '"Yes, dear?"'
- ! '"Why did you run away from me earlier?'
- You've never done that before," he murmured as she still stared at the screen.
- ! '"You''ll have to get under there and fix…that," she reported, pointing to something
  on the screen where a diagram of the underside of the console was displayed.'
- ! '"Liv, you''re dodging the question."'
- ! '"Damn right, I''m dodging the question.'
- I don't wanna talk about it."
- ! '"Well, I do, so could you stop looking at the scanner and look at me?"'
- ! '"Nope."'
- ! '"When we were in the hall, having a moment, you ran away.'
- Why?"
- ! '"Maybe I didn''t want a moment.'
- Ever think about that?"
- ! '"Now you''re lying because I could tell you were enjoying it until I told you
  not to hit me.'
- And I'm not going to ask again."
- ! '"Good."'
- ! '"Liv, what''s the matter?"'
- ! '"I''m getting…something," she strained as Amy and Rory hurried toward her to
  see if she was alright.'
- ! '"A telepathic message."'
- ! '"What does it say?"'
- ! '"I can hardly make it out," she replied before wincing again in pain, then the
  message came in clearly.'
- ! '"It''s…a little boy.'
- He's saying…'Please save me from the monsters.'"
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"Please save me from the monsters," he read aloud as Olivia frowned at him in
  wonder, the message dying down in her mind.'
- ! '"Haven''t done this in a while."'
- ! '"Haven''t done what?"'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"Making a house call," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"I''m fine, Rory," Olivia smiled as she stood tall.'
- ! '"Just haven''t gotten a telepathic message like that in a while."'
- ! '"What about you and the Doctor?"'
- ! '"Everything ok with you two?"'
- ! '"Oh…yeah, sort of," Olivia replied, honestly, but vaguely.'
- ! '"Just a little spat.'
- We'll get over it."
- ! '"Can''t imagine what your spats are like," he muttered, and she couldn''t help
  but chuckle before the TARDIS shuddered to a halt, making them all head for the
  door.'
- ! '"I still want to know what''s wrong, Liv," he murmured.'
- ! '"No offense, Doctor," Rory called as they all looked around.'
- ! '"Meaning the opposite?"'
- ! '"But we could get a bus somewhere like this," Rory resumed.'
- ! '"The exact opposite," the Doctor confirmed.'
- ! '"Well, I suppose it can''t all be planets and history and stuff, Rory," Amy retorted.'
- ! '"Yes, it can," the Doctor argued, grabbing Olivia''s hand to pull her toward
  the building.'
- ! '"Of course it can.'
- Today we're answering a cry for help from the scariest place in the universe…a child's
  bedroom."
- ! '"So, Olivia said she got a telepathic message," Rory recalled as he and Amy stopped
  up behind them, the Doctor pressing the button to call the lift.'
- ! '"Who sent that?"'
- ! '"That''s what we''re here to find out," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"And she said it was a kid," Amy recalled as well.'
- ! '"A little boy?"'
- ! '"He sounded scared," Olivia reported.'
- ! '"Very scared."'
- ! '"So scared that, somehow, his cry for help got through to us in the TARDIS,"
  the Doctor confirmed.'
- ! '"Yeah, but you traced it here?"'
- ! '"Exactly," he replied just as the lift opened.'
- ! '"Ah!'
- Going up."
- ! '"Now, I want you to ask around the building," he instructed them, releasing Olivia''s
  hand to wrap his arm around her shoulders from behind, setting his chin on her shoulder
  as the lift moved.'
- ! '"Look for clues."'
- ! '"Right, clues," Amy nodded, then frowned but the lift stopped and they all filed
  out before she could question him, Amy and Rory heading one way, Olivia and the
  Doctor heading another.'
- ! '"I''m surprised you''re letting me hold you hand," he admitted.'
- ! '"Oh, should I deny my own pleasures just because I''m irritated with you?"'
- ! '"I like having my hand held…even when you''re being…you."'
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor greeted as Olivia waved with a smile.'
- ! '"Is this about the bins?!"'
- ! '"Pardon?"'
- ! '"The bins!'
- I need new knees!"
- ! '"Not the bins, no, Miss…?"'
- ! '"Mrs.'
- Rossiter," she replied.
- ! '"I''ve already got a new hip.'
- I'll be down them stairs like Sherpa Tenzing, then."
- ! '"Wonderful," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"Can we come in?"'
- ! '"Of course not!"'
- ! '"You could be anyone!"'
- ! '"We could be, but we''re not," the Doctor replied as she started shutting the
  door.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor!"'
- ! '"This isn''t gonna work," she sighed, as they strolled down the balcony.'
- ! '"There''s too many.'
- We'll be here for hours."
- ! '"Or not," he replied, deftly as he looked down to the other end of the building.'
- ! '"He looks scared," Olivia noticed.'
- ! '"Yes, he does," he replied, pulling her toward the stairs leading to the next
  floor to meet Rory and Amy.'
- ! '"Hey!"'
- ! '"Any luck?"'
- ! '"Three old ladies, a traffic warden from Croatia, and a man with ten cats," the
  Doctor replied.'
- ! '"What are we actually looking for?"'
- ! '"Ten cats!"'
- the Doctor grinned then replied, "Scared kid, remember?"
- ! '"I found scary kids, does that count?"'
- ! '"Um, try the next floor down," the Doctor suggested.'
- ! '"Catch you later."'
- ! '"Oh!'
- Right, that was quick," the man said, making the couple frown at him.
- ! '"It was?"'
- ! '"Claire said she''d phone someone," the man explained as the Doctor tucked the
  paper away.'
- ! '"Social Services."'
- ! '"Yes, yes," the Doctor replied as Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"It''s not easy, you know," the man reported.'
- ! '"Admitting your kid''s got a problem."'
- ! '"You''ve got a problem, I''ve got a problem, I bet they''re connected," the Doctor
  replied.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor and this is Olivia Felton.'
- What can we call you?"
- ! '"Alex," he replied, shaking the Doctor''s hand then Olivia''s.'
- ! '"Hello, Alex," the Doctor grinned before taking Olivia''s hand and pulling her
  past him and into the flat.'
- ! '"So, tell us about George."'
- ! '"Have a seat," Alex entreated, gesturing toward the sitting room where the Doctor
  pulled Olivia toward the sofa to sit.'
- ! '"Would you like something to drink?"'
- ! '"Not yet, thank you," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Nothing for me, thanks," Olivia smiled before looking to the table in front
  of the sofa and reaching for the white album sitting on it.'
- ! '"Is it alright if I look at this?"'
- ! '"Oh, go ahead," Alex replied, sitting in the arm chair next to her.'
- ! '"It''s got George''s baby pictures here."'
- ! '"Ever since he was born, he''s been a funny kid," Alex explained.'
- ! '"Well, that''s good," the Doctor replied, shifting closer to Olivia to look at
  the pictures over her shoulder.'
- ! '"We like funny, don''t we, Liv?"'
- ! '"Well, he never cries," Alex explained, making Olivia give a frown.'
- ! '"Bottles it all up, I suppose.'
- Tell him off, he just looks at you."
- ! '"How old is he?"'
- ! '"He was eight in January," Alex replied.'
- ! '"I mean, he should be grown out of stuff like this, shouldn''t he?"'
- ! '"Maybe," the Doctor replied, setting the book back on the table.'
- ! '"It''s got worse, though, lately?"'
- ! '"Yeah, we talked about getting help," Alex nodded.'
- ! '"You know, maybe sending him somewhere.'
- I mean, he's scared to death of everything."
- ! '"Pantophobia," the Doctor reported.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"That''s what it''s called," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Pantophobia.'
- Including pants, I suppose, in that case."
- ! '"Sorry, Alex," Olivia smiled when the Doctor trailed off.'
- ! '"Please, continue."'
- ! '"He hates clowns," Alex resumed.'
- ! '"Understandable," the Doctor muttered, making Olivia smirk.'
- ! '"Old toys.'
- The lift sounds like someone breathing."
- Alex sighed before resuming, "Look, I don't know.
- Maybe you can get through to him."
- ! '"I''ll do my best," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"George?"'
- ! '"Are you ok?'
- What's the matter?"
- ! '"Wait," the Doctor whispered to her when she frowned at him.'
- ! '"Were you having a nightmare, son?"'
- ! '"It wasn''t a nightmare.'
- I wasn't asleep," George replied and his voice was so small that Olivia gave the
  Doctor a pitiable look, pleading with him to let her go in.
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor," he replied.'
- ! '"A Doctor?!"'
- ! '"Have you come to take me away?"'
- ! '"No, George," he replied.'
- ! '"I just want to talk to you."'
- ! '"What about?"'
- ! '"About the monsters," the Doctor replied, and Olivia watched the little boy blink
  rapidly as he just stared at them.'
- ! '"Who is she?"'
- ! '"My name is Olivia Felton, and I''m here to help the Doctor, help you."'
- ! '"Maybe it was things on telly, you know?"'
- ! '"Right," the Doctor blurted, working on the cube.'
- ! '"Scary stuff getting under his skin, frightening him."'
- ! '"Mm-hmm."'
- ! '"Should we stop letting him watch?"'
- ! '"Oh, no, don''t do that," Olivia objected, winking at George who only stared
  at her.'
- ! '"And Claire thought it might have been something he was reading," Alex went on.'
- ! '"Great!'
- Reading's great," the Doctor grinned, leaning forward to look at him around Olivia.
- ! '"Do you like stories, George?'
- All the classics."
- ! '"Rubbish.'
- I hate those things."
- ! '"Of course, it''s not good to leave things lying around the room like that, is
  it?"'
- She glanced at the cupboard and smiled to George, nodding at it and asking, "Does
  it go in here?"
- ! '"No, not in the cupboard," the Doctor realized.'
- ! '"Why not in there, George?"'
- ! '"It''s a…thing," Alex explained.'
- ! '"A thing we got him doing, ages back.'
- Creepy toys, scary pictures, that sort of thing."
- ! '"And is that where the monsters go?"'
- ! '"There''s nothing to be scared of, George.'
- It's just a cupboard."
- ! '"Front door," Alex sighed before turning to answer the continual pounding.'
- ! '"Is that a torch?"'
- ! '"Screwdriver," the Doctor corrected with a smile as Olivia smiled up at him before
  he stepped toward them and sat on the bed next to her.'
- ! '"A sonic one.'
- And other stuff."
- ! '"I''ve got one, too," Olivia smiled, pulling her Sonic out to show it to him.'
- ! '"Please may I see the other stuff?"'
- ! '"You may," the Doctor nodded as Olivia grinned at his politeness.'
- ! '"Pretty cool, huh?"'
- ! '"You wanna see it?"'
- ! '"That''s better," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"No tears from George.'
- There's brave little soldier."
- ! '"Bit rusty at this," he muttered before standing and pointing his Sonic at the
  cupboard.'
- ! '"Anyway, let''s open this cupboard, eh?'
- There's nothing to be—"
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Off the scale," he breathed, sitting on the bed again and staring at it with
  wide eyes as Olivia''s eyes widened at him.'
- ! '"Off the scale."'
- Alex stepped back in the room, sighing, "Right, sorry about that.
- So have we got this thing open yet?"
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"You don''t want to do that."'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Because George''s monsters are real," the Doctor replied, making Alex frown
  at him in confusion before the Doctor left the room.'
- ! '"I promise, we''ll be back in here in a second," she smiled, then touched her
  Sonic, still in his hand.'
- ! '"Keep that, just in case, ok?"'
- ! '"You''re supposed to be a professional," Alex snapped as the Doctor still moved
  around the kitchen.'
- ! '"I''ll never get him to sleep now.'
- You're so…irresponsible!"
- ! '"No, Alex, responsible, very," the Doctor shot back.'
- ! '"Cupboard bad.'
- Liv, find it for me."
- ! '"Sure," she frowned.'
- ! '"I''ll work on that."'
- ! '"Look, I''d like you to leave, please," Alex requested.'
- ! '"You''re just making things worse."'
- ! '"Will you stop making tea?!'
- I want you to leave!"
- ! '"No," the Doctor blurted, making Olivia sigh and lower her face into her hand.'
- ! '"What?'
- What do you mean, no?"
- ! '"Leave, get out."'
- ! '"Now, please!"'
- ! '"Look, maybe this was a bad idea.'
- We should sort out George ourselves."
- ! '"Can''t," the Doctor argued, reaching into the fridge for something then moving
  back to the counter.'
- ! '"No one''s gonna tell us how to run our lives.'
- We'll sort it!"
- ! '"I''m not just a professional, I''m the Doctor."'
- ! '"What that supposed to mean?"'
- ! '"It means I''ve come a long way to get here, Alex, a very long way.'
- Whatever's inside that cupboard is so terrible, so powerful, that it amplified the
  fears of an ordinary little boy across all the barriers of time and space."
- ! '"Eh?"'
- ! '"Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas like oceans set
  on fire, through empires of glass and civilizations of pure thought and a whole
  terrible, wonderful universe of impossibilities.'
- ! 'And one thing I can tell you, Alex: Monsters are real."'
- ! '"You''re not from social services, are you?"'
- ! '"First things first," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"You got any Jammie Dodgers?"'
- ! '"What is it with these photos?"'
- He shut the book, setting it down and standing as he called, "Anyway!
- But decision…should we open the cupboard?"
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Should we?"'
- ! '"Gotta open the cupboard haven''t we?"'
- ! '"Course we have.'
- How else will we ever find out what's going on here?!"
- ! '"Right, but you said—"'
- ! '"Monsters, yeah, well, that''s what I do.'
- Breakfast, dinner and tea, fight the monsters."
- ! '"This is an average day for us," Olivia chimed in, downing the last of her tea.'
- ! '"Ok, yeah, you''re right," Alex nodded to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Or maybe we shouldn''t open the cupboard," the Doctor recanted.'
- ! '"We have no idea what might be in there.'
- We can't open the cupboard!"
- ! '"God, no!'
- No, we mustn't!"
- ! '"Right.'
- That settles it."
- ! '"Settles what?"'
- ! '"Going to open the cupboard."'
- ! '"I don''t understand," he admitted.'
- ! '"It has to be the cupboard.'
- The readings from the Sonic Screwdriver, they were—Olivia, get that album."
- ! '"Alex, how old is George again?"'
- ! '"I told you, just turned eight," Alex replied.'
- ! '"So you remember when he was born, then?"'
- ! '"Of course."'
- ! '"Of course you do.'
- How could you not?"
- ! '"This is you and Claire on Christmas Eve 2002, yes?"'
- ! '"Yeah," Alex replied.'
- ! '"A couple weeks before George was born," the Doctor observed of the pictures.'
- ! '"Tell me about the day he arrived.'
- It must have been wonderful."
- ! '"It was the best day of my…life," Alex replied, but he frowned as if trying to
  remember something.'
- ! '"Sure?"'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"You don''t sound sure."'
- ! '"What are you trying to say?'
- I told you before I want you to go!"
- ! '"Alex, what''s the matter?"'
- ! '"I can''t—!"'
- ! '"Oh, this is scary."'
- ! '"No, Alex, this is scary," the Doctor shot back, showing him the album, flipping
  a page back and forth.'
- ! '"Claire with baby George.'
- New born, yes?"
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Less than a month after Christmas."'
- ! '"So?!"'
- ! '"So look, look, Claire''s not pregnant."'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"Not pregnant."'
- ! '"Well of course not!'
- Claire can't have kids!"
- ! '"Say that again," the Doctor ordered, closing the album.'
- ! '"We tried everything," Alex explained as Olivia wrapped an arm around George,
  taking her Sonic Screwdriver back from him.'
- ! '"She was desperate.'
- How…How can I have forgotten that?"
- ! '"Who are you, George?"'
- ! '"It''s not possible," Alex breathed.'
- ! '"This isn''t—"'
- ! '"George?"'
- ! '"George!"'
- ! '"What''s going on?!'
- Are you doing this?!"
- ! '"What''s happening?!"'
- ! '"Please save me from the monsters!"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"George!"'
- ! '"George!'
- George!"
- ! '"We went…" Alex shuddered as he stood, Olivia moving to stand as well and the
  Doctor walked around the room to investigate.'
- ! '"We went…we went into the cupboard.'
- How can it be bigger in here?!"
- ! '"Good thing you haven''t seen the TARDIS," Olivia retorted, stepping toward him
  to place her hands on his shoulders and look him in the eye.'
- ! '"Are you ok?"'
- ! '"Where are we?"'
- ! '"Obvious, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Doll''s house.'
- We're inside the doll's house."
- ! '"The doll''s house?!"'
- ! '"Yeah, in the cupboard in your flat.'
- The doll's house."
- ! '"No, look, slow down, would ya?"'
- ! '"Look, wooden chicken.'
- So we're either inside the doll's house or this is a refuge for dirty, posh people
  who eat wooden food."
- ! '"Or giant termites," Olivia chimed in, setting her armful of things on the table.'
- ! '"Termites trying to get on the property ladder," he nodded, grabbing a huge wooden
  fruit.'
- ! '"No.'
- Is it possible?"
- ! '"Look, will you stop?!"'
- ! '"What is he?'
- How?"
- ! '"Sounds like a perception filter," Olivia explained just as the Doctor pulled
  her down the hall again, stopping in front of a mirror as she went on.'
- ! '"A powerful one.'
- It must have changed everyone's memories."
- ! '"Now, what could do that?"'
- ! '"There''s something wrong here," she whispered.'
- ! '"We''re not alone."'
- ! '"Good to know, we''ll deal with it later," he replied before pulling her into
  another room, Alex right behind them.'
- ! '"So, Claire can''t have kids and something responded to that, responded to that
  need.'
- What could do that?"
- ! '"Well, I thought you were the experts, fighting monsters all day long," Alex
  shot back.'
- ! '"You tell me!"'
- ! '"Oi!'
- Listen, Mush, old eyes, remember?"
- ! '"I''ve been around the block a few times.'
- I can't remember everything."
- ! '"Doctor," Olivia tried.'
- ! '"It''s like trying to remember the name of someone you met at a party when you
  were two."'
- ! '"Doctor, the lift," Alex tried as well.'
- ! '"And I can''t just plum for Brian, like I normally do."'
- ! '"Doctor, listen!"'
- ! '"Shh!'
- What's that?"
- ! '"It''s the lift," Alex explained.'
- ! '"It''s the sound that the lift makes.'
- George is scared stiff of it!"
- ! '"What do we do?"'
- ! '"We''ve got to get a message to George," he replied.'
- ! '"Maybe you can do it.'
- I'll tell you what to say."
- ! '"Five times," Alex said, making them look to him in wonder.'
- ! '"The lights, it''s happening five times.'
- We have to switch the lights on and off five times."
- ! '"No you''re getting it," the Doctor replied, stepping toward Alex and kneeling
  next to him, Olivia standing between them.'
- ! '"What do you mean?"'
- ! '"What''d you tell George to do, Alex, with everything that scares him?"'
- ! '"Well, put it in the…cupboard."'
- ! '"Exactly.'
- A psychic repository for all his fears."
- ! '"But what is he?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," the Doctor replied before giggling sounded behind them.'
- ! '"Oh, my god," Alex blurted as they both stood and the Doctor pulled out his Sonic
  to use it on the doll.'
- ! '"Gun!'
- You've got a gun!"
- ! '"It''s not a gun, and it doesn''t work on wood!"'
- ! '"I''ve got to invent a setting for wood.'
- It's embarrassing!"
- ! '"Run!"'
- ! '"Don''t run away!"'
- ! '"We just want to play."'
- ! '"Massive psychic field, perfect perception filter, and that need, that need of
  Claire''s to…to… Stupid Doctor!"'
- ! '"Ow!'
- Of course he is!"
- ! '"He''s a what?!"'
- ! '"A cuckoo," the Doctor explained as Olivia ran to another door to open it.'
- ! '"A cuckoo in the nest.'
- He's a Tenza."
- ! '"Millions of them hatch in space and then, whoof!'
- Off they drift, looking for a nest."
- ! '"The Tenza young can sense exactly what their foster parents want and then they
  assimilate."'
- ! '"George is an alien?!"'
- ! '"Yup!"'
- ! '"But he''s our child!"'
- ! '"Of course he is," the Doctor went on.'
- ! '"The child you always wanted.'
- It's all completely instinctive, subconscious."
- ! '"He''s not even aware he''s doing it?"'
- ! '"We have to make him aware.'
- I can talk to him."
- ! '"George," she called.'
- ! '"George, listen to me, you''re the only one who can stop this, but you have to
  believe you''re safe.'
- We can't save you from the monsters only you can!"
- ! '"Rory!"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Where''s Amy?"'
- ! '"George you have to face your fears!'
- End it now!"
- ! '"George!"'
- ! '"Sweetie, you did it!'
- Everything's gonna be fine."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"George, you created this world," Olivia called to him, the four staying on the
  staircase, watching George start to panic.'
- ! '"You created it, you can destroy it."'
- ! '"Something''s holding him back," he replied to her unasked question before looking
  to Alex.'
- ! '"That''s what did it.'
- He thought he wasn't wanted, that someone was going to come and take him away."
- ! '"Well, we…we talked about it," Alex explained as the dolls closed in on George.'
- ! '"And he heard you," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"Alex, a Tenza''s sole function is to fit in, to be wanted, and you were rejecting
  him," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"We just couldn''t cope!'
- We needed help!"
- ! '"Yes, but George didn''t know that!'
- He still thinks it."
- ! '"But how can we keep him?'
- He's not—"
- ! '"Not what?"'
- ! '"Not…human."'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"Dad!"'
- ! '"Whatever you are, whatever you do, you''re my son, and I will never, ever send
  you away."'
- ! '"Hi!"'
- ! '"Oh, hi!"'
- ! '"You must be Claire.'
- Nice to meet you!"
- ! '"Claire!"'
- ! '"How do you feel about kippers?"'
- ! '"Uh, who…?"'
- ! '"They sent someone about George," he explained.'
- ! '"It''s all sorted."'
- ! '"Yeah, we had a great time, didn''t we?"'
- ! '"Yeah!"'
- ! '"He''s fine now," Olivia assured Claire, tapping George''s nose and making him
  giggle.'
- ! '"What, just like that?"'
- ! '"Yes," the Doctor replied, looking her in the eyes and nodding, "Trust me."'
- ! '"Doctor, wait!"'
- ! '"Sorry, yes, bye!"'
- ! '"No, you can''t just—I mean, you—"'
- ! '"It''s sorted.'
- Proud of you."
- ! '"What, that''s it?!"'
- ! '"Apart from having him eat his veggies and getting him to a good school, yup,"
  Olivia nodded with a huge grin, hugging the Doctor''s arm.'
- ! '"Is he gonna, I don''t know, sprout another head or three eyes, or something?"'
- ! '"He''s one of the Tenza, remember?"'
- ! '"He''ll adapt perfectly now.'
- Be whatever you want him to be."
- ! '"You keep this, ok?"'
- ! '"It''s easy to use.'
- Can you do that?"
- ! '"Just…don''t let your mates get a hold of it.'
- That could be bad."
- ! '"Thank you," he grinned and Olivia smiled back as she ruffled his hair when she
  stood to head back to the Doctor.'
- He took her hand and pulled her down the walkway but a few yards away he turned
  back and called, "Might pop back around puberty, mind you!
- Always a funny time!"
- ! '"Why, what happens with puberty?"'
- ! '"What doesn''t happen with puberty, Liv?"'
- ! '"Good thing nothing too strange will happen with our daughter when she gets there,"
  Olivia added, making the Doctor look to her with wide eyes.'
- ! '"Just old fashioned, boring, human stuff."'
- ! '"You want a daughter, too?"'
- ! '"Come on, you two!"'
- ! '"Things to do, people to see, whole civilizations to save.'
- You feeling ok?"
- ! '"Um, I think so," Amy replied.'
- ! '"Well, it''s good to be back together again," Olivia grinned.'
- ! '"In the flesh," the Doctor added before pulling Olivia toward the TARDIS.'
- ! '"I wanna see those planets and be apart of history and stuff!"'
- ! '"Where do you want go?"'
- ! '"Um…" Amy hummed.'
- ! '"Mind''s gone blank."'
- ! '"Well I have just been turned into a wooden dolly."'
- ! '"Excuses, excuses," Olivia grinned as the TARDIS took off.'
- ! '"It''s tough though," Rory replied.'
- ! '"It''s like being given three wishes.'
- The whole universe?"
- ! '"Universes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Ooh, three wishes!'
- How about that?"
- ! '"Only if we get wishes too," Olivia smirked.'
- ! '"No, no, of course not," he refused.'
- ! '"Giving you three wishes would be dangerous."'
- ! '"What, you mean you don''t know what my wishes would be?"'
- ! '"I could think of one," Amy replied.'
- ! '"You, hush," the Doctor shot back, pointing at Amy in warning and she laughed
  before he looked to Olivia as she still worked the console.'
- ! '"I need some tea.'
- Let' make a cuppa."
- ! '"You ok, Liv?"'
- ! '"Fine," she smiled.'
- ! '"Why?'
- Are you ok?"
- ! '"I''m always ok," he shrugged.'
- ! '"I just wanna make sure…"'
- ! '"That I''m ok.'
- I'm fine."
- ! '"So, you''re not cross with me anymore…about earlier?"'
- ! '"Nope."'
- ! '"So where are we going?"'
- ! '"But…I still want to know why you''re so scared, Liv."'
- Olivia frowned up at him in surprised wonder before scoffing, "I'm not scared."
- ! '"You''re hiding something, darling.'
- Are you having dreams again like the ones you had back at Torchwood?"
- ! '"No.'
- Can you understand that, my love?"
- ! '"Just tell me, honestly…are you pregnant?"'
- ! '"No, you idiot," she smirked, gently nudging him with her hip, making him chuckle
  before she murmured, "Have you…?"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"No.'
- Never mind."
- ! '"Come on, Liv.'
- Tell me."
- ! '"Have you…thought of names…at all?"'
- ! '"That answer your question, darling?"'
- ! '"That''s a lot of names," Olivia chuckled.'
- ! '"Well…some are alien."'
- ! '"Why don''t we take this opportunity to trim that list down a bit…starting with
  that one."'
- ! '"Is that for a boy or a girl?"'
- ! '"It''s for either, and I like that name!'
- It's a Judoon name!"
- ! '"Not helping your case, babe."'
- ! '"You''d probably think of something boring like…Jane or Wendy or Julie."'
- ! '"It can be unique and fun, but if he or she is growing up on Earth, as a human,
  we have to take into consideration that kids, with the exception of our child…and
  George, are ruthless little brats."'
- ! '"What about this one?"'
- ! '"No, we''re not naming our child ''Custard.'''
- Did you even hear what I just said?"
- ! '"Yes, but you''re being very boring about this, Olivia.'
- Shame on you."
- ! '"I''m not being boring, I''m being realistic!"'
- ! '"Ugh!'
- You best not use that word in front of Little Sonta."
- ! '"That is no name for a child going to public school!"'
- ! '"Strax?"'
- ! '"Theta, I''m warning you."'
- ! '"Theta Sigma Junior?"'
- ! '"No Theta.'
- No Sigma, and I refuse to call our son Junior!"
- ! '"I meant that one if it was a girl."'
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"Can I come down there for a mo?"'
- ! '"Why are you asking?"'
- ! '"You''re my husband.'
- You wanna come down here and have your way with me, that's your right."
- ! '"Well, I wasn''t thinking of that," he muttered, and she could tell he was blushing.'
- ! '"I love this," she whispered as his hand stroked down her back.'
- ! '"Feeling both your hearts at the same time.'
- It's so calming."
- ! '"What were you thinking about, Liv?"'
- ! '"I could hear you thinking."'
- Olivia giggled, tracing invisible designs on his chest as she replied, "I was thinking…I
  kind of want more than one."
- ! '"That so?"'
- ! '"How many more?"'
- ! '"At least one more?'
- I have Aaron, I want that for our kids."
- ! '"We''ll see," he whispered, pressing a kiss to her head and pulling her closer.'
- ! '"Who knows, maybe if you''re lucky we''ll get twins on the first go, eh?"'
- ! '"I love you," she whispered.'
- ! '"Love you, too, Liv," he grinned back.'
- ! '"Apalapucia."'
- ! '"Say it again," Olivia smirked, watching the Doctor run around the console.'
- ! '"Apalapucia."'
- ! '"Apalapu…" Amy trailed off as the Doctor grabbed Olivia''s hand and twirled her.'
- ! '"Chia!"'
- ! '"Apalapucia," Rory echoed.'
- ! '"Apalapucia," Amy smiled.'
- ! '"What beautiful word."'
- ! '"Beautiful word, beautiful world," the Doctor replied, shoving a lever down on
  the console.'
- ! '"Apalapucia, voted number two planet in the top ten greatest destinations for
  the discerning intergalactic traveler."'
- ! '"Why couldn''t we go to number one?"'
- ! '"It''s hideous!"'
- ! '"Everyone goes to number one.'
- I give you…"
- ! '"Doors," Rory blurted as Olivia frowned at the Doctor in wonder.'
- ! '"Doors.'
- Yes, I give you doors," he retorted stepping out of the TARDIS with Rory and Olivia.
- ! '"But on the other side of those doors, I give you sunsets, spires, soaring, silver
  colonnades."'
- ! '"Have you seen my phone?"'
- ! '"Your phone?"'
- ! '"You mobile telephone.'
- I bring you to a paradise planet two billion light-years from Earth and you want
  to update…twitter?"
- ! '"Sunsets, spires, soaring, silver colonnades.'
- It's a camera phone," Amy retorted.
- ! '"On the counter by the DVDs," he nearly sneered.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- I forgot my Sonic!"
- ! '"Be back in a sec."'
- ! '"Hurry up, you two!"'
- ! '"Now I know you gave me a new one," she murmured to the TARDIS, looking around
  the seats.'
- ! '"I just can''t remember—There it is!"'
- ! '"Ready?"'
- ! '"Ready," Olivia grinned, flipping her Sonic in the air before catching it and
  tucking it away in her jacket.'
- ! '"Hey, it''s locked," she called.'
- ! '"Push the button," Rory called back as Olivia stepped forward and glanced at
  the panel next to the door with a green anchor and a red waterfall.'
- ! '"Which button?"'
- ! '"Rory?"'
- ! '"We should try the other one," Olivia suggested but when she turned to head out
  of the room the door slid shut.'
- ! '"Lovely."'
- ! '"Deadlocked," she ground out.'
- ! '"Great."'
- ! '"Hey, Olivia, look at this," Amy called, making her turn to watch Amy sit in
  one of the chairs in front of the magnifying glass, flicking it and jumping when
  she heard Rory''s voice and saw the Doctor''s image as Olivia stepped behind her.'
- ! '"What do you mean, you found them?"'
- ! '"But they''re not here!'
- I can see them but they're not here."
- ! '"Where are we?"'
- ! '"In fact, where are you?"'
- ! '"This is way too Alice in Wonderland for me," Olivia blurted before they heard
  a door open on the Doctor and Rory''s end and they could barely make out a robot
  entering the room, a hand raised.'
- ! '"Hand!"'
- ! '"Hello, hand.'
- Robot with hands, Rory."
- ! '"Welcome to the Two Streams Facility," the robot greeted.'
- ! '"Will you be visiting long?"'
- The screen started to glitch with static and Olivia called, "Doctor, something's
  happening!"
- ! '"Liv?!'
- Amy?!"
- ! '"Stay calm.'
- Stay still!"
- ! '"Olivia!'
- Do something!"
- ! '"Alright, just give me a second," Olivia assured her as she tried the Sonic but
  it did nothing to the glass.'
- ! '"Doctor, can you hear me?'
- Doctor?"
- ! '"Why didn''t the Sonic work?"'
- ! '"Maybe everything on this side is deadlocked," Olivia guessed, lifting a hand
  to run it through her hair before sitting next to Amy.'
- ! '"Just watch the glass.'
- I have to concentrate."
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"I''m gonna try and talk to him through telepathy.'
- Watch the glass and tell me if they come back."
- ! '"I can''t—" she choked, making Amy look to her in wonder, but she only stared
  ahead.'
- ! '"I can''t find it.'
- This is…impossible!"
- ! '"So what do we do now?"'
- ! '"I guess, we wait for the Doctor."'
- ! '"A week," Amy growled.'
- ! '"Where are they?!"'
- ! '"I don''t know," Olivia grumbled, her voice muffled by her arms wrapped around
  her head.'
- ! '"It''s ok," the Doctor''s voice suddenly came from the glass, making Olivia''s
  head shoot up to stare at it as it flickered on.'
- ! '"I''ve got you.'
- You're fine."
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Will you be visiting long?"'
- ! '"Doctor, a little help, Doctor!"'
- ! '"And where have you been?"'
- ! '"What do I tell it?!"'
- ! '"Will you be visiting long?"'
- ! '"We have been here a week!"'
- ! '"A week?!"'
- ! '"A week?!"'
- ! '"I''m so sorry," the Doctor began before explaining, "Aha!'
- Same room, two different times…two different timestreams running parallel, but at
  different speeds."
- ! '"We''re in a faster timestream," Olivia realized just before his image blurred.'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Doctor, it''s going again!"'
- ! '"Liv, use the Sonic!"'
- ! '"I can''t, it doesn''t work!"'
- ! '"Well it worked on my end!"'
- ! '"This side must be deadlocked then, because it didn''t work!"'
- ! '"There.'
- Shh!"
- ! '"Why has this got hands?"'
- ! '"Organic skin," the Doctor explained, stepping toward the robot holding its hand
  up to Rory.'
- ! '"Ultimate universal interface.'
- But why not just give it eyes?"
- ! '"Will you be visiting long?"'
- ! '"As long as it takes," the Doctor told the robot before he stepped back toward
  the glass to ask the girls, "What exactly did you do?"'
- ! '"We came in and I pressed the door button," Amy replied.'
- ! '"Amy, there are two buttons," Rory explained.'
- ! '"The Green Anchor and the Red Waterfall.'
- Which one did you push?"
- ! '"She pushed the Red Waterfall," Olivia sighed, rubbing her temple as she felt
  an impending headache coming on.'
- ! '"Doctor, I tried to talk to you telepathically but it wouldn''t work.'
- It was like…you didn't even exist."
- ! '"Two timestreams," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"You''d already moved forward when you tried to contact me.'
- You can't contact the past through telepathy."
- ! '"I pressed Red Waterfall and she wasn''t there!"'
- ! '"Ok, so we can''t follow them directly," the Doctor observed.'
- ! '"You know, it''s never simple!'
- We didn't know!"
- ! '"Statement…" the Handbot replied and after a paused the red light on its chest
  lit up as it said, "rejected.'
- This is a kindness facility for those infected with Chen 7."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Chen 7," the Doctor repeated.'
- ! '"The One Day plague."'
- ! '"What, you…you get it for a day?"'
- ! '"No, you get it and you die in a day."'
- ! '"There are forty thousand residents in the Two Streams Facility," the Handbot
  continued.'
- ! '"Please remain in the sterile areas.'
- Visiting hours are now."
- ! '"Sterile area," the Doctor breathed as he sat in front of the glass.'
- ! '"I''m safe."'
- ! '"What about us?!"'
- ! '"Chen 7 only effect two-hearted races, like Apalapucians," he explained.'
- ! '"And Time Lords," Olivia breathed in panic.'
- ! '"Yeah, like me.'
- What did you two eat?"
- ! '"Nothing," she replied.'
- ! '"I wasn''t hungry."'
- ! '"Neither was I," Olivia frowned in wonder.'
- ! '"No, because all that Red Waterfall time is compressed," the Doctor realized.'
- ! '"That''s the point of the Time Glass.'
- You could be in here for a day and watch them live out their entire lives."
- ! '"And watch them grow old in front of your eyes," Rory realized.'
- ! '"That''s horrible."'
- ! '"No, Rory, it''s kind.'
- Which would you choose?"
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Doctor, no.'
- Don't leave us."
- ! '"I''m here, girls," they heard his voice sooth, making Olivia shoot her gaze
  around the room in wonder.'
- ! '"I''m right here."'
- ! '"Where are you?"'
- Olivia asked before stilling and asked, "Are we looking at you?"
- ! '"Turn left just a fraction," he instructed, making both of them turn.'
- ! '"Bit more."'
- ! '"Stop.'
- That's it."
- ! '"Eye to eye?"'
- ! '"Eye to eye to eye…to eye."'
- ! '"You always forget about me," Olivia pouted.'
- ! '"Liv, stop it.'
- Until then…you're on your own."
- He used the Sonic on it, making Rory ask, "What are you doing?"
- ! '"Locking it on to the girls.'
- No one will mind."
- ! '"Ah!'
- Now, go."
- ! '"For luck," she smiled and he nodded with a sad smile before she followed Amy
  who turned in the doorway.'
- ! '"Rory," Amy called.'
- ! '"I love you.'
- Now save me."
- ! '"This is locked on to them permanently," the Doctor explained, hooking the Time
  Glass up to the console.'
- ! '"Play the signal into the console, the TARDIS will follow it."'
- ! '"Now, then, I know you''re in here.'
- Ha ha!"
- The Doctor stood to look at Rory wearing thick-framed glasses and grinned, "How
  do I look?!"
- ! '"Ridiculous," Rory blurted.'
- ! '"Glasses are cool, see?"'
- ! '"Hello, handsome man."'
- ! '"Hello," Rory smiled in embarrassment.'
- ! '"Rorycam!"'
- ! '"Oh!'
- You can see what I see," he realized.
- ! '"We''re breaking in to Two Streams," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Now, I can''t go in there.'
- You will be my eyes and ears."
- ! '"Rorycam.'
- Rescue Amy."
- ! '"And Olivia."'
- ! '"Got it."'
- ! '"That''s the spirit.'
- Now smashing through a timewall could get a bit hairy."
- ! '"Is it safe?"'
- ! '"Don''t know.'
- Best hold on to something."
- ! '"This place gives me the creeps," she muttered.'
- ! '"You''re not the only one," Amy agreed.'
- ! '"Welcome to the Two Streams Facility," a feminine voice greeted and the light
  disappeared.'
- ! '"Who are you and why can''t we see you?"'
- ! '"I am the interface between yourselves and the systems of the Two Streams facility,"
  the voice replied, the light returning every time it spoke.'
- ! '"I will be your guide, your teacher, your friend."'
- ! '"Oh, yeah.'
- That's not creepy at all," Olivia nodded, sardonically.
- ! '"Welcome to Two Streams," another voice called, making them turn to the desks
  lining the wall where a woman appeared on a screen behind it grinned at them.'
- ! '"What are your names, please?"'
- ! '"Amy," Amy replied, warily.'
- ! '"Amy Pond."'
- ! '"Olivia Felton," Olivia answered with a frown.'
- ! '"Welcome Amy Pond.'
- Are you traveling together?"
- ! '"Yes," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"As residents, you will now have access to all of the entertainment zones inside.'
- All that you could wish for and more is through the departure gate, provided for
  you with kindness."
- ! '"Wow," Olivia blurted as the image faded and Amy led her through the departure
  gate.'
- ! '"Billions of lightyears from Earth in the future and recordings are still annoying."'
- ! '"Some things never change," Amy replied, heading up a set of stairs, both wandering
  around.'
- ! '"Hello?'
- Wait."
- ! '"Amy, I wouldn''t," Olivia warned, hurrying after her and the Handbot moved its
  hand through the air as they stopped in front of it.'
- ! '"You are carrying unregistered bacteria.'
- Please let me help you."
- ! '"No, we''re not from this world," Amy tried as they both backed away from the
  Handbot.'
- ! '"Your medicine will kill us."'
- ! '"Statement rejected.'
- This is a kindness."
- ! '"God, I hate needles!"'
- ! '"Secondary delivery system engaged," the Handbot announced as its head opened
  to aim a dart shooter at the girls.'
- ! '"Amy!'
- Look out!"
- ! '"Unauthorized infection on check-in.'
- Version 223."
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"Over here!"'
- ! '"No residents detected," one of them said, making Amy stop and Olivia watched
  as they moved away.'
- ! '"They didn''t see us," Amy gasped for air, watching the Handbots move away.'
- ! '"How didn''t they see us?"'
- ! '"Interface?"'
- ! '"I am here, Amy Pond," Interface replied, shining the light in her face.'
- ! '"Turn that light off!"'
- ! '"So, um, what is this?'
- How does it work?"
- ! '"This is the Gate.'
- From here you may depart to any of Two Stream's entertainment zones."
- ! '"Cinema," a voice announced before she pressed another button.'
- ! '"Aquarium."'
- ! '"Nice," she nodded before pressing another button.'
- ! '"Garden."'
- ! '"Garden?"'
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Well, it''s beautiful," Amy nodded in awe.'
- ! '"Ok, seriously, Alice in Wonderland," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"I keep expecting a white rabbit to run past me in a waistcoat holding a pocket
  watch."'
- ! '"The perfect replica of the Shill Governor''s mansion on Shillana," Interface
  explained.'
- ! '"Well, since they''re famous," Olivia shrugged, looking around the garden.'
- ! '"You really could spend a lifetime here."'
- ! '"Not that we''re going to," Amy added before they began wandering.'
- ! '"Hey, Interface?"'
- ! '"Olivia Felton?"'
- ! '"We need to hide somewhere safe while we wait for our friends."'
- ! '"Two Streams is a safe, nurturing environment."'
- ! '"Ok, let''s try it this way: Is there a place we can hide from the Handbots?"'
- Interface remained silent making Amy sigh in exasperation before she asked, "Ok,
  before we stood in a sort of vent, and there was light and smoke and the Handbots
  couldn't see us.
- Why not?"
- ! '"Ok, I will put it another way: What were those vent thingies?"'
- ! '"The vents channel the exhaust fumes from the temporal engines that hold the
  multiple timestreams in place."'
- ! '"And these temporal engines mess up the Handbots sensors.'
- So where's the temporal engines?"
- An image of a door appeared in front of them as Interface answered, "Temporal engines
  held within."
- ! '"Amy!"'
- ! '"What happened?"'
- ! '"Hear that?"'
- ! '"Feedback.'
- Let's get to those engines."
- ! '"Go check it out, I''ll leave the sign," Olivia told Amy, letting her inside
  the doors.'
- She nodded once she was finished and sighed, "Please hurry, my love."
- ! '"Red Waterfall," Rory sighed in relief, seeing the symbol on the walls of the
  room they''d landed in.'
- ! '"We made it!"'
- ! '"Good on us," the Doctor replied as Rory shut the door.'
- ! '"How do we know that we''re in the same Red Waterfall as Amy and Olivia?"'
- ! '"Focus on the positive," the Doctor replied through the Rorycam as Rory stared
  at a statue with no arms and a naked bust.'
- ! '"We locked on to their timestream.'
- Eyes front, soldier!"
- ! '"Right, yes, sorry," Rory sputtered before heading farther into the gallery.'
- ! '"Apalapacians are the great cultural scavengers, Rory," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"This gallery''s a scrapbook of all their favorite places."'
- ! '"Bit of Earth," Rory noticed, looking at the Mona Lisa before looking at a strange
  looking sculpture.'
- ! '"Bit of alien.'
- Bit of…" He stared at a tall sculpture that was leaking purple ooze.
- ! '"…whatever the hell that is.'
- Where is everyone?"
- ! '"Rory, switch the timeglass on and Sonic it.'
- I wonder what happens if we mix the filters."
- ! '"And there they are," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Forty thousand timestreams, overlapping.'
- It's thousands."
- ! '"Are they happy?"'
- ! '"Oh, Rory, trust you to think of that.'
- Better than the alternative."
- ! '"I come in peace!"'
- ! '"Peace!'
- Peace!"
- ! '"I waited," the figure in front of him said in a distorted voice.'
- ! '"S-Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"I waited for you," the figure said again, pulling the sword away and lifting
  the visor it wore to reveal a familiar face…aged.'
- ! '"Amy," Rory gasped before the figure behind him shoved him forward and stepped
  around him, lifting its own visor to reveal Olivia…aged as well.'
- ! '"Olivia.'
- Doctor, what's going on?"
- ! '"Uh, I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly," the Doctor admitted.'
- ! '"No, please, please!"'
- ! '"Rory!'
- Out of the way!"
- ! '"The Handbots carry a black box in case they go offline," Amy explained kneeling
  on the other side of the bot to watch Olivia use her Sonic on it.'
- ! '"I''m changing the cause of termination from ''Hostile'' to ''Accidental'',"
  Olivia explained.'
- ! '"They''re easy to reprogram with the Sonic."'
- ! '"I use my Sonic Probe when I take them out," Amy added, taking something from
  her belt and sticking it inside the Handbot.'
- ! '"Amy," Rory breathed, making her turn to him.'
- ! '"Rory," she nodded.'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Because the only way we''ve survived this long is by making the Handbots think
  we don''t exist."'
- ! '"Don''t touch the hands," Olivia advised, standing tall.'
- ! '"There''s anesthetic in the skin.'
- Knocks you out if you touch them."
- ! '"But you''re still here," Rory observed, confused as Amy stood and turned to
  him.'
- ! '"You didn''t save me," she retorted, making Rory glance between her and Olivia
  before Amy marched back toward the exit of the gallery.'
- ! '"But this is the saving!"'
- ! '"This is us saving the both of you!'
- The Doctor just got the timing a bit out!"
- ! '"We''ve been on our own a long, long time," Amy began as Rory stepped in front
  of her.'
- ! '"I''ve had decades to think nice thoughts about him.'
- Got a bit harder to stay charitable once I entered decade four."
- ! '"Forty years?"'
- ! '"Just the two of you?"'
- ! '"Thirty-six years," Amy replied, fiddling with her hair as she muttered, "Thanks."'
- ! '"No, right," Rory sputtered.'
- ! '"I mean…you look great.'
- Really, really."
- ! '"Eyes front, soldier" Olivia smirked, stepping next to Amy.'
- ! '"Still can''t win, then," Rory scoffed.'
- ! '"In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him," Amy continued, stepping
  around Rory, Olivia following her.'
- ! '"I hate the Doctor.'
- And you can hear every word of this through those ridiculous glasses, can't you,
  raggedy man?"
- ! '"Uh…yes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Putting the speakerphone on."'
- ! '"You told us to wait, and we did," Amy continued.'
- ! '"A lifetime."'
- ! '"Amy—!"'
- ! '"You''ve got nothing to say to me."'
- ! '"Liv!'
- Behind you!"
- ! '"Learned that on the first day," Olivia smirked.'
- ! '"The feedback knocks them out."'
- ! '"Ok, so, we just take the TARDIS back to the right timestream, yeah?"'
- ! '"We can stop any of this happening."'
- ! '"We locked on to a timestream, Rory," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"This is it."'
- ! '"This is so wrong," Rory stated, still following Amy around the facility.'
- ! '"I got old, Rory," Amy snapped.'
- ! '"What did you think was going to happen?"'
- ! '"Hey," Rory shot back, reaching forward to grab her arm, and Olivia walked around
  them, stopping at the door they were heading toward.'
- ! '"I don''t care that you got old, I care that we didn''t grow old together.'
- Please."
- ! '"Don''t touch me," Amy muttered, pulling back from him.'
- ! '"Don''t do that."'
- ! '"It''s like you''re not even her," Rory observed.'
- ! '"We''ve been here thirty-six years, three months, and four days," Olivia told
  him as Amy stopping next to a door with red smudged on it.'
- ! '"This facility was built to give people a chance to live," Amy added.'
- ! '"We walked in here and we died.'
- Anything, Doctor?"
- ! '"Where did you get a Sonic Screwdriver, Amy?"'
- ! '"I made it, with Olivia''s help," Amy replied.'
- ! '"And it''s a Sonic Probe."'
- ! '"You made a Sonic Screwdriver?"'
- ! '"Probe," Amy ground out before turning to head through the door, Rory following,
  and just as Olivia was about to head after the two, she was stopped when she felt
  a presence she thought she''d never feel again in her mind.'
- ! '"Liv..."'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"My love…is that really you?"'
- ! '"So you still love me?"'
- ! '"Of course, you idiot.'
- It was hard but…I never let you go."
- ! '"Olivia Felton: The Girl Who Never Let Me Go."'
- ! '"Better believe it."'
- ! '"Oh, don''t get sentimental," Amy snapped at Rory.'
- ! '"It''s just a robot.'
- You'd have done the same."
- ! '"I don''t know that I would''ve," the Doctor shot back from Rory''s glasses.'
- ! '"And there he is, the voice of God," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Survive because no one''s gonna come for you.'
- You taught me that."
- ! '"Is that all he taught you, Amy?"'
- ! '"Don''t lecture me, starry-eyed girl, flying through time and space with your
  blue-box man on whimsy," Amy ground out at her then turned to Rory to speak to the
  Doctor through the glasses.'
- ! '"All I''ve got, all I''ve had, for thirty-six years, is cold, hard reality.'
- I call it what it is, a probe, and I call my life what it is…hell."
- ! '"Liv, Amy Pond, I''m going to put this right," the Doctor promised.'
- ! '"You said you learned from an interface.'
- Can I speak with it?"
- ! '"It doesn''t work in here," Olivia replied as Amy looked to her watch.'
- ! '"2:23," she announced.'
- ! '"The garden will be clear now.'
- Stay or go?"
- ! '"Sorry, me?"'
- ! '"No, I''m coming with you."'
- ! '"Then try not to get killed.'
- Whatever," Amy sputtered before heading toward the door.
- ! '"Why is she like this?"'
- ! '"It''s not my fault."'
- ! '"She knows that," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"She''s not angry with you."'
- ! '"But why is she acting this way?"'
- ! '"She hit him with a cricket bat when he came back after twelve years, what did
  you think she was gonna be like after thirty-six?"'
- ! '"Ah, you have a point."'
- ! '"I''m talking to you, too, Doctor."'
- ! '"Yes, yes, I heard.'
- Duly noted, Liv."
- ! '"When we first came here, we had to trick the interface into giving us information,"
  she explained.'
- ! '"We reprogrammed it now.'
- It'll tell us anything, except how to escape."
- ! '"The one thing we''d like to know," Olivia muttered.'
- ! '"You hacked it?"'
- ! '"That''s genius."'
- ! '"Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines like that have
  a regulator valve.'
- It has to be kept at a distance from the main reactor, of there'd be feedback."
- ! '"Interface, where''s the regulator?"'
- ! '"The regulator valve is held within," Interface replied, displaying a blueprint
  of it.'
- ! '"Oh, very, very… Interface, I need to run through some technical specifications.'
- Rory, give me to Amy a minute."
- ! '"Why not Olivia?"'
- ! '"Give him to Amy," Olivia nodded, seeming to understand why and Rory pulled the
  glasses off to hand them to Amy.'
- ! '"Here you go," he nodded before she took the glasses and placed them over her
  eyes, Olivia trying to hold back her smile at the way they looked on her.'
- ! '"They look ridiculous," Amy voiced.'
- ! '"That''s what I told him," Rory replied.'
- ! '"Still, anything beats a fez, eh?"'
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"I think that''s the first time I''ve laughed in thirty-six years," Amy admitted.'
- ! '"I''ll just, um…leave you two geniuses alone.'
- Go have a chat with Olivia," Rory sputtered before heading toward her and Olivia
  looked over her shoulder at Amy.
- ! '"I''ll be on patrol," she reported and Amy nodded.'
- ! '"Come on, Rory."'
- ! '"So how come you''re not so different?"'
- ! '"When the Doctor left me the first time for four years and I waited for him,
  I thought he''d forgotten about me," she explained, still walking along.'
- ! '"When he came back, I slapped him in the face.'
- I never gave up hope or faith in him all these years."
- ! '"So you''re saying Amy gave up on me," Rory guessed, making Olivia stop and turn
  to him, stopping him with a hand to his shoulder.'
- ! '"No, Rory," she shook her head.'
- ! '"She gave up on the Doctor.'
- She doesn't want to admit she missed you."
- ! '"That''s Amy," Rory scoffed, before he frowned at the doorway to his right, making
  Olivia follow his gaze.'
- ! '"How can you have a door without a wall?"'
- ! '"That''s the gate," Olivia explained as he stepped toward the door.'
- ! '"It leads to other entertainment gateways.'
- Rory, wait—!"
- ! '"Rory!'
- Look out!"
- ! '"Rory.'
- Rory," Amy urged as Olivia looked around for more Handbots.
- ! '"Glasses," Rory blurted as he awoke.'
- ! '"Stupid!"'
- ! '"You saved me," he realized.'
- ! '"Don''t get used to it," she shot back.'
- ! '"You''ve been crying.'
- A little bit."
- ! '"Shut up, Rory."'
- ! '"You have, haven''t you?"'
- ! '"Woman with a sword, don''t push it."'
- ! '"Ok, so, here''s the plan," the Doctor began as Amy gave the glasses back to
  Rory.'
- ! '"Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly, but in Two Streams, it''s extra wobbly.'
- It won't hurt…probably, almost probably and then, Amy Pond, Olivia Felton, I'm gonna
  save you two."
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Time''s up.'
- Handbots coming."
- ! '"Amy, we have to help them save us," Olivia ground out as she marched on.'
- ! '"I need you both to think back thirty-six years ago," the Doctor explained just
  as they reached the door and Amy marched through the door, not responding as Olivia
  and Rory watched her.'
- ! '"You told them to leave us a sign," Rory said, lifting the glass to look at the
  smudging on the door where Olivia had written their message, which he could read
  through the glass.'
- ! '"We did," Olivia murmured, making Rory look to her but she only stared at the
  door.'
- ! '"We waited.'
- But I'm done waiting."
- ! '"Why won''t you help us?!"'
- ! '"He wants to rescue past us from thirty-six years back, which means we''ll cease
  to exist," Amy shot back as they rounded into their hiding place.'
- ! '"Everything we''ve seen and done dissolves.'
- Time is rewritten."
- ! '"That''s good, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"We will die," she explained.'
- ! '"Another Amy will take my place, another Olivia will take yours, an Amy and Olivia
  who never got trapped in Two Streams, an Amy who grew old with you, Rory, an Olivia
  who grew old with the Doctor and they, in thirty-six years, will not be us."'
- ! '"But you''ll die in here!"'
- ! '"Not if you take us with you.'
- You came to rescue us, so rescue us."
- ! '"Leave them and take the two of you?"'
- ! '"Amy, you''re not being fair," Olivia ground out.'
- ! '"We could take this Amy and this Olivia with us, easy, but if we do, our Amy
  and…our Olivia have to wait thirty-six years to be rescued," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"So I have to choose," Rory breathed.'
- ! '"Which wife do I want?"'
- ! '"She is me," Amy reminded him.'
- ! '"We''re both me."'
- ! '"You being here is wrong!"'
- ! '"For a single day, an hour, let alone a lifetime.'
- I promised."
- ! '"What do you think you''re doing?"'
- ! '"Why are you being so selfish?!"'
- ! '"You know how this works," Amy shot back.'
- ! '"Back then, our futures refused to help us, so now we have to refuse to help
  our pasts.'
- Paradox."
- ! '"I don''t recall seeing myself as a wrinkly old bag refusing to help myself!"'
- ! '"You want another Olivia to take your place with the Doctor?!"'
- ! '"Yes!"'
- ! '"I would gladly swap these thirty-six years here for thirty-six years with the
  Doctor.'
- Now, you think about it…do you really wanna be my enemy?"
- ! '"Olivia?"'
- ! '"Theta, do me a favor," she replied without hesitation.'
- ! '"Anything, darling."'
- ! '"When we save the past me—which I know we will, because I''m not gonna let Amy
  say no—talk to her like this, first thing, please?"'
- ! '"You don''t have to say please, my love.'
- Of course I will."
- ! '"Good.'
- The younger, prettier me."
- ! '"I saw you through the glasses, Liv.'
- You're gorgeous."
- ! '"Liar."'
- ! '"Not to you, Liv.'
- Never to you."
- ! '"Where''s Amy?"'
- ! '"In there," he replied.'
- ! '"Talking to herself."'
- ! '"You pace like him," he noticed, making her glance at him, but she didn''t stop.'
- ! '"I do that when I haven''t seen him for a while," she smirked.'
- ! '"It makes me feel close to him when I pick up his habits."'
- ! '"I''m gonna pull time apart for you," she said before stepping toward him and
  gently pressing her lips to his and Rory hugged her as Olivia looked awkward.'
- ! '"Doctor, Two Streams is back on air," Olivia smirked as Amy led them toward the
  regulator valve.'
- ! '"Right, ok, so this is big news," Amy reported.'
- ! '"This is temporal earthquake time.'
- Every law of time says that shouldn't be possible."
- ! '"Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future is what enables you to change
  it, especially if you''re bloody minded, contradictory, and completely unpredictable."'
- ! '"So basically if you''re the two of them," Rory retorted.'
- ! '"Yes, if anyone could defeat predestiny, it''s our wives," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"It''s not about what I''m doing," Amy said, stopping next to the valve.'
- ! '"I''m trusting you to watch my back, Rory."'
- ! '"Always," Rory nodded.'
- ! '"You and me, always."'
- ! '"And who''s gonna watch out for Olivia, you two?!"'
- ! '"I can take care of myself just fine, thanks, darling," Olivia smirked.'
- ! '"Here''s the deal," Amy continued, making them both frown at her in wonder.'
- ! '"You take us, too, in the TARDIS.'
- Us, too."
- ! '"But that means there''d be two of each of you.'
- Permanently, forever."
- ! '"And that way we both get to live."'
- ! '"Amy, don''t be ridiculous," Olivia snarled.'
- ! '"Doctor, you leave me here and you take my past self.'
- I'm not gonna be apart of this deal."
- ! '"Two Amys together.'
- Can that work?"
- ! '"I dunno, it''s your marriage," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"Doctor."'
- ! '"Perhaps.'
- The TARDIS could sustain the paradox."
- ! '"Right, Amy, and Amy," Rory nodded.'
- ! '"The wife and the wife.'
- Right."
- ! '"Ok, girls—past girls—stand by the door.'
- Future Amy, can I borrow your Sonic Screw—Probe?"
- ! '"It''s a screwdriver," Amy retorted, handing it to Rory as Olivia pulled her
  Sonic out as well.'
- ! '"Rory, Sonic it.'
- Triple our power."
- ! '"Girls-now, you''re our link to the girls-then.'
- Leave the red loose, and, on no account, touch anything yellow."
- ! '"Should I help him, darling?"'
- ! '"No, Liv, stay there.'
- Rory can do it," the Doctor called as Rory worked.
- ! '"Come on, Rory!'
- It's just quantum physics!"
- ! '"Yes, right, ok, blue into red," Rory muttered to himself as Amy and Olivia watched
  for Handbots.'
- ! '"And now the levers—throw them in order.'
- Hold it in your heads and do not let it go."
- ! '"Macarena," Amy murmured.'
- ! '"Barcelona," Olivia whispered.'
- ! '"Amy''s doing the Macarena," Rory reported.'
- ! '"Our first kiss."'
- ! '"What''s Olivia saying?"'
- ! '"Barcelona?"'
- ! '"Oh, my God," the Amys said.'
- ! '"Whoa," the Olivias murmured.'
- ! '"Hello," she greeted.'
- ! '"Hello," younger Amy replied.'
- ! '"I dunno what—" they said together, making both Olivias smirked at them.'
- ! '"Weird," Rory breathed.'
- ! '"Ok, this is weird.'
- Right just stop doing that."
- ! '"How about Amy One speaks first?"'
- ! '"Which one''s Amy One?"'
- ! '"Well—"'
- ! '"I am.'
- Rory, just stop her doing that."
- ! '"You''re Olivia One," younger Olivia told her future self.'
- ! '"Thank you," older Olivia replied.'
- ! '"Rory!'
- Glasses off!"
- ! '"Temporal feedback.'
- We created a massive paradox."
- ! '"And the TARDIS hates it!"'
- ! '"She''s still phasing, trying to get out of here.'
- You're on your own now."
- ! '"I''m not on my own," he assured himself.'
- ! '"I''ve got my wives…and his wives."'
- ! '"Incoming!"'
- ! '"With me," older Amy, Amy One, ordered as Olivia One spun her stick in her hands
  before pulling out a dagger from her belt to toss it to Olivia Two, who caught it.'
- ! '"They''re cutting off the departure gate!"'
- ! '"We can''t get back to the TARDIS!"'
- ! '"Side door," Amy One reported.'
- ! '"We''ll go behind them."'
- ! '"Now this is a romp!"'
- ! '"I''ve missed this."'
- ! '"So you think you''re gonna come with us, just like that?"'
- ! '"Yeah, just like that," Amy One retorted.'
- ! '"Rory, talk to her."'
- ! '"Rory, talk to her."'
- ! '"Now, ladies," Rory pleaded as they continued on.'
- ! '"Does she really think—?"'
- ! '"Yup," Olivia One nodded, knowing what Olivia Two''s question was.'
- ! '"And the Doctor said—?"'
- ! '"Yes, he did."'
- ! '"What an idiot."'
- ! '"I know."'
- ! '"Oi, stop talking about me," the Doctor''s voice rang in Olivia Two''s head,
  making her stop at the bottom of the stairs.'
- ! '"Theta?!"'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"I''ve got her," Olivia One assured them, grabbing Olivia Two''s hand to drag
  her after them as she spoke to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Theta, are you really gonna take both Amys?!'
- You know the TARDIS can't sustain that big of a paradox!"
- ! '"I try to be romantic and caring by contacting you the first chance I get and
  you give me a scolding?"'
- ! '"Theta, old Amy is gonna go mental."'
- ! '"I know."'
- ! '"Where are you gonna live?"'
- ! '"Not with you," Amy One retorted.'
- ! '"Don''t worry.'
- I'll go traveling, pop back for Christmas, maybe Easter."
- ! '"Amy, you always say, cooking Christmas dinner, you wish there were two of you,"
  Rory recalled as they found the departure gate and both Olivia''s pulled out their
  Sonics to use it to lock the door, but they smirked at each other as Olivia One
  stepped back toward Rory and the Amys to let Olivia Two lock it.'
- ! '"Can''t we just teleport in?"'
- ! '"It''s not a teleport," Amy One explained as Olivia One leaned over the console
  of buttons.'
- ! '"It''s a time jump."'
- ! '"We can''t jump within the same timestream," Amy Two added.'
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"The TARDIS is in the gallery," Rory reported as the Handbots started pounding
  on the door.'
- ! '"Gallery closed," Interface said.'
- ! '"The controls aren''t responding," Olivia One ground out, pressing the buttons.'
- ! '"It''s stuck.'
- Locked from the outside."
- ! '"Can you unlock them?"'
- ! '"Yeah, give me a minute and your cutest smile," she smirked, making Olivia One
  step away with her hands raised as Olivia Two rolled her eyes as Rory chuckled at
  her.'
- ! '"That''s the one."'
- ! '"Can you stop flirting with me?"'
- ! '"You''re old enough to be my—"'
- ! '"I''ve known you my whole life.'
- Don't get coy now."
- ! '"We have a problem!"'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"Go!"'
- ! '"We''ve got your back!"'
- ! '"Get her to the TARDIS!"'
- ! '"I''ve got you covered!"'
- ! '"Amy!'
- Look out!"
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"It''s just an anesthetic.'
- She'll be fine," he assured Rory before hurrying to the door to see Amy One sitting
  with Olivia One reclined back against her.
- ! '"There he is," Olivia One smiled, weakly, the medicine running through her system
  killing her slowly.'
- ! '"My Doctor.'
- He's standing there in that blue box…and there I am, right next to him."
- ! '"Olivia, you can''t die," Amy shuddered.'
- ! '"We''re going with them."'
- ! '"No, I''m not," Olivia breathed, looking up at her with glazed eyes.'
- ! '"And neither are you."'
- ! '"I''m sorry," the Doctor said quickly just before he slammed the door in Amy''s
  face when she reached it.'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"I lied to her, Rory," the Doctor confessed as Amy pounded on the door.'
- ! '"There can never be two Amys in the TARDIS.'
- The paradox was too massive."
- ! '"You can''t leave her.'
- She'll die!"
- ! '"No, Rory, she''ll never have existed," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"When we save our Amy none of this will have happened."'
- ! '"She happened!'
- She's there!"
- ! '"She''s not real," Olivia shook her head.'
- ! '"She is real," Rory ground out, stepping toward the door where the two stood.'
- ! '"Let her in."'
- ! '"Look, we take this Amy we leave ours," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"There can only be one Amy in the TARDIS!'
- Which one do you want?!"
- ! '"Your choice."'
- ! '"This isn''t fair," Rory growled.'
- ! '"You''re turning me into you."'
- ! '"Your choice," the Doctor repeated before heading toward the console as Rory''s
  eyes went to Olivia.'
- ! '"You knew, didn''t you?"'
- ! '"Your future self and you knew."'
- ! '"Of course I did, Rory," she replied.'
- ! '"Why do you think my older self refused to be apart of it?"'
- ! '"Why didn''t you tell me?"'
- ! '"I did.'
- You saw what happened with the glasses just by having our pasts and futures in the
  same room, and you still wouldn't listen."
- ! '"You wanted to grow old with her," Olivia recalled, heading toward the console.'
- ! '"That''s why you married her."'
- ! '"Theta—?"'
- ! '"Quiet, Liv," he whispered, holding onto her so tightly she almost couldn''t
  breathe, and she wrapped her arms around him in return, not saying a word.'
- ! '"Did you always know it would never work, saving both Amys?"'
- ! '"I promised you I''d save her, and there she is," he finally replied, nodding
  to Amy.'
- ! '"Safe."'
- ! '"We''ll leave you two alone," Olivia smiled, pulling on the Doctor''s arm but
  he remained in his spot.'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"How are you feeling?"'
- ! '"Where is she?"'
- ! '"I knew you''d get us out of there," she smiled as they rounded a corner.'
- ! '"Even though it went wrong, I knew you''d fix it.'
- You always fix it."
- ! '"Theta, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"I saw you die, Liv," he shuddered against her ear, making her frown in confusion.'
- ! '"I''m right here, my love," she whispered, neither one letting the other go.'
- ! '"I''m alive."'
- ! '"Not you," he replied.'
- ! '"The older you, back there."'
- ! '"But she wasn''t real," she whispered.'
- ! '"That never happened.'
- And those years I spent there never happened because now I get to spend those years
  with you."
- ! '"I never want to see that again, Liv.'
- It won't happen."
- ! '"Of course it won''t.'
- My Highwayman will never be powerless to save me."
- ! '"What room are we in?"'
- ! '"No idea," he admitted, making her giggle.'
- ! '"As usual.'
- Where are we going next?"
- ! '"No idea."'
- ! '"As usual."'
- ! '"Try another one," she grinned, and the scanner beeped then stopped and she giggled
  again.'
- ! '"Another one."'
- ! '"Oh, that one''s so cute!'
- She's ginger!"
- ! '"Liv, what are you doing?"'
- ! '"Nothing," she blurted.'
- ! '"You''re lying," he retorted, reaching for the scanner to turn it on but she
  slapped his hand away, gently.'
- ! '"Fine, I''m lying, but don''t look at what I was looking at," she blurted.'
- ! '"It''s only gonna freak you out."'
- ! '"Hey!'
- Who's side are you on?!"
- ! '"Who''s this little girl?"'
- ! '"It…could be our daughter," she murmured, making his frown disappear as his eyes
  widened before he looked to the screen again, letting Olivia go.'
- ! '"Oh, she''s gorgeous!"'
- ! '"She''s ginger!'
- How'd you do this?"
- ! '"Well, the TARDIS compiled all your regenerations and my own image and combined
  them to make several images of what our children might look like," Olivia replied,
  stepping closer to him.'
- ! '"If you like that one, you should see the one before it."'
- ! '"Oh, I like this one," he nodded, wrapping his arms around Olivia to pull her
  in front of him and rest his chin on her shoulder.'
- ! '"Look at those curls!'
- She looks just like you."
- ! '"It''s just one of an impossible number of possibilities," Olivia smiled.'
- ! '"I have a feeling she''ll be more like you.'
- I won't be able to keep up with her."
- ! '"You will," he grinned.'
- ! '"You''ve kept up with me this long, haven''t you?'
- A little tike with my genius won't be too hard to run after."
- ! '"It''ll be worse," Olivia blurted.'
- ! '"Will it now?"'
- ! '"Theta!'
- Stop!"
- ! '"What''s going on?"'
- ! '"This is a matter between husband and wife, Amy," the Doctor replied, rushing
  around the console, hoping to catch Olivia off guard but she laughed as she ran
  around the console and ducked behind Amy and Rory.'
- ! '"Oh, please, we don''t need to be apart of your twisted shenanigans," Amy shot
  back as Olivia kept herself hidden behind Rory and the Doctor stopped in front of
  them.'
- ! '"It''s not what you think," he assured her.'
- ! '"You''re harboring a fugitive, Rory.'
- If you know what's good for you give her up."
- ! '"You''ll never take me alive!"'
- ! '"Whatever she''s promised you, it''s all rubbish," the Doctor shot back.'
- ! '"Ok, I don''t know what to do, now," Rory admitted.'
- ! '"What are the charges?"'
- ! '"Count the first: insinuating that our offspring, hers and mine, would be, like
  me, a handful," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Worse then me."'
- ! '"Well, that''s not a crime, that''s truth," Rory shrugged.'
- ! '"Your case is dismissed," Amy added.'
- ! '"Formal protest," the Doctor called, raising his hand high in the air.'
- ! '"Denied," Amy retorted, heading down the stairs toward the console.'
- ! '"Ha ha!'
- I have lawyers!"
- ! '"The wives always get the good lawyers," the Doctor muttered before turning to
  the console.'
- ! '"So, where we going now?"'
- ! '"Let''s go to Ravenscala!"'
- ! '"The people are six hundred feet tall!'
- You have to talk to them in hot air balloons, and the tourist information center's
  made of one of their hats!"
- ! '"That sounds like a serious case of hat hair," Olivia blurted, making Amy giggle
  before the Doctor slammed a lever down then grabbed Olivia''s hand to drag her toward
  the door, Amy and Rory following.'
- ! '"I''m sorry, but I don''t see any huge hats," Amy observed as the Doctor came
  up between her and Rory.'
- ! '"Amy, Beaky, this could be the most exciting thing I have ever seen!"'
- ! '"You''re kidding," Rory blurted.'
- ! '"How can you be excited about a crummy hotel on Earth?"'
- ! '"Because, assembled Ponds, wife, this is not Earth," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"This has just been made to look like Earth.'
- Can you imagine?"
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Then where are we?"'
- ! '"I dunno," the Doctor replied, heading toward the lobby.'
- ! '"Something must have yanked us off-course.'
- Look at the detail on that cheese plant!"
- ! '"Fascinating," Olivia muttered, pulling an apple from the bowl next to the cheese
  plant the Doctor was sniffing.'
- ! '"Right, but who would mock up an Earth hotel?"'
- ! '"Colonists, maybe, recreating a bit of home, like when ex-pats open English pubs
  in Mallorca," the Doctor guessed, taking a bite of his apple as Olivia and Rory
  went to the far wall to examine the pictures lining it.'
- ! '"No, whoever did this, I''m shaking his/her hand/tentacle."'
- ! '"Have you seen these?"'
- ! '"Look at the labels underneath."'
- ! '"Commander Halke, Defeat," Olivia read out loud with a frown.'
- ! '"Tim Heath, Having His Photo Taken," Rory read another.'
- ! '"Lady Silvertear, Daleks."'
- ! '"Paige Barnes, Other People''s Socks," Amy read.'
- ! '"Tim Nelson, Balloons."'
- ! '"Novice Prynne, Saberwolves," Olivia read another.'
- ! '"Royston Luke Gold, Plymouth?'
- Lucy Hayward, That Brutal Gorilla."
- ! '"Doctor, what does it mean?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," he confessed.'
- ! '"Let''s find out."'
- ! '"Boy, that was quick!"'
- ! '"We surrender," the odd one with the handkerchief said.'
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"It''s ok, we''re nice," Rory assured them.'
- ! '"She''s threatening me with a chair leg!"'
- ! '"Who are you?"'
- ! '"Oh, god, we''re back in reception," the young man with the glasses muttered.'
- ! '"I''ve never been threatened with a chair leg before," the Doctor recalled, pushing
  Olivia in front of him and hiding behind her.'
- ! '"No, hang on, I tell a lie."'
- ! '"Did you just say, ''It''s ok, we''re nice''?"'
- ! '"Alright, everybody just shut up!"'
- ! '"Rita, be careful, yeah?"'
- ! '"Their pupils are dilated," Rita observed, backing up to stand with her group
  again.'
- ! '"They are as surprised as we are, besides which, if it''s a trick, it''ll tell
  us something."'
- ! '"Oh, you''re good," the Doctor smirked, making Olivia turn a frown of irritation
  to him, hearing his tone.'
- ! '"Oh, she''s good.'
- Amy, with regret, you're fired."
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I''m kidding," he quickly replied but held his hand next to his ear as he looked
  at Rita mouthing, ''We''ll talk.'''
- ! '"What about me?'
- Am I fired too?"
- ! '"I take it, from the pathological compulsion to surrender, you''re from Tivoli,"
  the Doctor said to the odd looking man with the kerchief.'
- ! '"Yes, the most invaded planet in the galaxy," he replied.'
- ! '"Our anthem is called ''Glory to Insert Name Here.''"'
- ! '"You with the face, Howie, you said you were surprised to be back in reception."'
- ! '"The walls move," Howie replied.'
- ! '"Everything changes."'
- ! '"You, Clever One, what''s he talking about?"'
- ! '"The corridors twist and stretch," Rita replied.'
- ! '"Rooms vanish and pop up somewhere else.'
- It's like the hotel's alive."
- ! '"That''s enough of that ridiculous elevator music," Olivia muttered, shutting
  the radio on the desk off.'
- ! '"Yeah, and it''s huge," Howie explained of the hotel.'
- ! '"With, like, no way out."'
- ! '"Did you try the front door?"'
- ! '"No, in two days, it never occurred to us to try the front door," Rita replied,
  sardonically as the Doctor used his Sonic on the door, Olivia leaning back on the
  front desk to watch everyone.'
- ! '"Thank god you''re here."'
- ! '"They''re not doors," he announced.'
- ! '"They''re walls.'
- I mean the windows are…" He pulled the curtains open where windows should've been
  to reveal the same wall.
- ! '"Right.'
- Big day for a fan of walls."
- ! '"It''s not just that," Rita explained.'
- ! '"The rooms have things in them."'
- ! '"Things?"'
- ! '"Hello!'
- Don't I like things, Liv?"
- ! '"You love things," she replied with a wag of her head.'
- ! '"So what are the things?"'
- ! '"Bad dreams," Rita replied, warily.'
- ! '"Well…that certainly killed the mood," Olivia blurted.'
- ! '"How did you get here?"'
- ! '"I don''t know," Rita replied.'
- ! '"I''d just started my shift.'
- I must've passed out because, suddenly, I was here."
- ! '"I was blogging," Howie explained.'
- ! '"Next thing, this."'
- ! '"Well, I was at work," the alien, Gibbis, took his turn.'
- ! '"I''m in town planning.'
- We're lining all the highways with trees so invading forces can march in the shade,
  which is nice for them, you know?"
- ! '"So what have we got?"'
- ! '"People being snatched from their lives and dropped into an endless shifting
  maze that looks like a 1980s hotel with bad dreams in the bedrooms.'
- Well, apart from anything else, that's just rude."
- ! '"We''ll pop back to the TARDIS," he said as they all followed him.'
- ! '"I''ll do a planetwide diagnostic sweep.'
- Then we'll have a singsong."
- ! '"Where''s the TARDIS?"'
- ! '"We did park it here, right?"'
- ! '"What''s a TARDIS?"'
- ! '"Our way out," Rory sighed, resting on the railing to lower his face into his
  hands.'
- ! '"And it''s gone."'
- ! '"Ok," he murmured.'
- ! '"This is bad."'
- ! '"How bad?"'
- ! '"At the moment, I don''t know how bad, but, certainly, we''re three buses, a
  long walk, and a taxi from good."'
- ! '"That''s pretty bad," Olivia nodded as he turned to the group.'
- ! '"Are there any more of you?"'
- ! '"Joe," Rita replied.'
- ! '"But he''s tied up right now."'
- ! '"Doing what?"'
- ! '"No, I mean he''s tied up right now."'
- ! '"Oh, literally," Olivia nodded then frowned, "Why?"'
- Rita glanced to Howie before replying, "We'd better just show you."
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor greeted.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor."'
- ! '"We''re going to die here," Joe replied with a dazed look over his face.'
- ! '"Well, they certainly didn''t mention that in the brochure," the Doctor replied,
  finding an empty chair and pulling it toward him as he asked, "Is Joe there?'
- Can I have a quick word?"
- ! '"Oh, it''s still me, Doctor, but I''ve seen the light," Joe argued as the Doctor
  sat in the chair, pulling Olivia onto his knee.'
- ! '"I lived a blasphemous life, but he has forgiven my inconstancy, and soon he
  shall feast."'
- ! '"You''ve been here two days," Olivia recalled.'
- ! '"What''s he waiting for?"'
- ! '"We weren''t ready," Joe replied, making her frown.'
- ! '"We were still raw."'
- ! '"But now, you''re, what, cooked?"'
- ! '"If you like," Joe smiled, dreamily.'
- ! '"Soon you will be, too.'
- First, find your room."
- ! '"My room?"'
- ! '"There''s a room here for everyone, Doctor," Joe explained.'
- ! '"Even you."'
- ! '"You said you''d seen the light, now," the Doctor recalled.'
- ! '"Nothing else matters anymore, only him," Joe sighed, looking around the room.'
- ! '"It''s like these things.'
- They make me laugh now."
- ! '"Gottle o'' geer.'
- Gottle o' geer."
- ! '"You should go," Joe warned.'
- ! '"He''ll be here soon."'
- ! '"I think you should come with me," the Doctor advised.'
- ! '"Liv, lead the way to the lobby, won''t you?"'
- ! '"Why you four?"'
- ! '"That''s what I don''t understand, aside from all the other things I don''t understand."'
- ! '"God, that music!"'
- ! '"What does it matter?"'
- ! '"Sooner or later, someone will come along and rescue us.'
- Or enslave us."
- ! '"First we find the TARDIS," the Doctor announced.'
- ! '"Quick thing before we go: If you feel drawn to a particular room, do not go
  in, and make sure someone else can see you at all times."'
- ! '"Joe said ''He will feast''," Rita recalled.'
- ! '"Is there something here with us?"'
- ! '"Something to add, Joe?"'
- ! '"Here comes a candle to light you to bed.'
- Chop, chop, chop, chop."
- ! '"Can we do something about him?"'
- ! '"Ooh!'
- Look what I found!"
- Olivia grinned, stepping in front of Joe and ripping the end off the roll of duct
  tape, grinning, "We can absolutely do something about him."
- ! '"Personally, I think you''ve got the right idea," Gibbis told Joe.'
- ! '"At times like this I think of my old school motto: Resistance is exhausting."'
- ! '"Liv?"'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"Yeah," she chirped.'
- ! '"Fine…ish.'
- Well…no, no I'm not."
- ! '"It''ll be alright," he murmured.'
- ! '"Not if you see what''s in my room," she muttered, making him frown down at her
  but they stopped when a door opened and a man in a white tank top and shorts with
  a whistle around his neck stepped out.'
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor blurted.'
- ! '"Have you forgotten your P.E.'
- kit again?"
- the man demanded, and when the Doctor didn't answer he yelled, "Right, that's it,
  you're doing it in your pants!"
- ! '"Howie!'
- Don't!"
- ! '"Oh, look girls," one of them called.'
- ! '"It''s H-H-Howie!"'
- ! '"What''s ''loser'' in K-K-K-Klingon?"'
- ! '"Shut th-th-th-th-the-the door," Howie pleaded, stepping back and Olivia slammed
  the door shut.'
- ! '"This is just some m-m-messed up CIA stuff, I''m telling you."'
- ! '"You''re right," the Doctor agreed as Olivia stepped toward Howie to wrap an
  arm around his shoulders.'
- ! '"Keep telling yourself that.'
- It's a CIA thing, nothing more."
- ! '"It''s alright, Howie, it''s gonna be ok," Olivia murmured, rubbing his arm as
  they all continued down the hall.'
- ! '"Ok, whatever that is, it''s not real, yeah?"'
- ! '"No, no, I''m sure it isn''t," the Doctor assured her.'
- ! '"But just in case, let''s run away and hide anyway…in here.'
- Liv!"
- ! '"Hiding!"'
- She slammed the door shut, not even seeing what was in the room with her and sighed,
  "Figures I'd end up by myself, in the dark."
- ! '"Identify!"'
- ! '"Identify!"'
- ! '"You are an associate of the Doctor!'
- Exterminate!"
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"I''ve got you, Liv, I''ve got you.'
- You're safe."
- ! '"Dalek," Olivia shuddered, making him pull her close as she snuggled into him.'
- ! '"It''s not real," he assured her, stroking her back, soothingly.'
- ! '"You''re not leaving my side ever again, darling.'
- Everyone back to the dining hall."
- ! '"Where were you?"'
- ! '"We ended up in a room with Weeping Angels," he replied, keeping his arms around
  her.'
- ! '"It seems this is a ''Lesser of Two Evils'' sort of place."'
- ! '"I''d have picked the Angels."'
- ! '"I know."'
- ! '"What happened to Joe?"'
- ! '"The Minotaur got to him," the Doctor murmured, pulling back to take her hand
  and lead the way back to the dining hall.'
- ! '"If it''s any consolation, I''ve met the Weeping Angels," Amy told Gibbis.'
- ! '"So I know how… In fact, I thought that room was for me."'
- ! '"Joe was right," Gibbis retorted.'
- ! '"Whatever it is in here, it actually wants to kill us.'
- Not oppress us or enslave us, kill us!"
- Amy moved from her spot to take a seat next to Gibbis, saying, "Listen, the Doctor's
  been part of my life for so long now, and he's never let me down, even when I thought
  he had, when I was a kid and he left me.
- But don't tell him I said that, because, you see, the smugness would be terrifying."
- ! '"Of course, if the Weeping Angels were meant for me, then your room is still
  out there, somewhere," Gibbis smiled, making Amy frown at him before standing to
  step toward Olivia.'
- ! '"Thank you," Olivia smiled before watching her step toward the Doctor with a
  cup of tea for him and herself and felt a twinge of jealousy as they started talking.'
- ! '"You ok, Olivia?"'
- ! '"I''m good, thanks," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone I have this overwhelming urge
  to notify their next of kin," Rory suddenly appeared on the other side of her, making
  she and Amy both laugh, but he jumped when he noticed he was standing close to Amy.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Sorry," he blurted to her.'
- ! '"Last time I said something like that, you hit me with your shoe."'
- ! '"I remember that," Olivia chimed in.'
- ! '"She even sat down to untie it first."'
- ! '"Olivia, can I ask you something?"'
- ! '"Sure," Olivia nodded.'
- ! '"Why are you so afraid of Daleks?"'
- ! '"I know you don''t remember this, but it was when the Earth was sent to the Medusa
  Cascade," Olivia began.'
- ! '"The Daleks were everywhere, rounding people up as guinea pigs for one of their
  machines, picking off the ones that dared to fight back.'
- ! '"I just stared at it, terrified.'
- It was the scariest thing I'd ever experienced."
- ! '"Do you know why it just flew off and left you alone?"'
- ! '"No," Olivia replied, shaking her head with a shrug.'
- ! '"I was just glad it did.'
- I'll never get over their voices."
- ! '"So it''s nothing but sheer terror then," Rory nodded in understanding and Olivia
  nodded in confirmation.'
- ! '"Have you told the Doctor?"'
- ! '"I don''t have any secrets from him," Olivia smiled, but it fell when she added,
  "Except one."'
- ! '"Do you think that was your room?"'
- ! '"No," Olivia muttered.'
- ! '"I''m terrified of Daleks, but my worst fear is still in one of these rooms,
  and I''m afraid that…if the Doctor sees it too, something even more terrible than
  having my soul sucked by a Minotaur is gonna happen.'
- Excuse me."
- ! '"What, exactly, happened to him?"'
- ! '"He died," the Doctor replied, bluntly, making Rita frown at him in wonder.'
- ! '"You are a medical doctor, aren''t you?"'
- ! '"You haven''t just got a degree in cheesemaking or something."'
- ! '"No," he replied defensively before admitting, "Well, yes, both, actually.'
- All his vital organs simply stopped, as if the simple spark of life—his loves and
  hates, his faiths and fears—were just taken."
- He sniffed at the cup in his hand before realizing, "And this is a cup of tea."
- ! '"Of course," Rita nodded as the Doctor licked the rim of the cup, making Olivia
  scoff at him.'
- ! '"I''m British.'
- That and tutting."
- ! '"But how did you make it?"'
- ! '"All hotels should have a well-stocked kitchen, even alien fake ones."'
- ! '"I heard you talking when you arrived," Rita explained.'
- ! '"Look, it''s no more ridiculous than Howie''s CIA theory, or-or mine."'
- ! '"What''s yours?"'
- ! '"This is Jahannam," she replied.'
- ! '"You''re a Muslim," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"Don''t be frightened," Rita replied, good-naturedly.'
- ! '"So, I''m guessing from the fact that we''re all in torment here, that you think
  this is hell?"'
- ! '"The whole ''80s hotel thing took me by surprise, though," Rita admitted with
  a nod as they turned to look around the room.'
- ! '"And all these fears and phobias wandering about are mostly completely unconnected
  to us, so why are they still here?"'
- ! '"Maybe the cleaners have gone on strike," Rita replied, making him laugh and
  Olivia frowned between them, even as he still held a hand around her waist.'
- ! '"I like you," he nodded to Rita, making Olivia bite her lower lip as she looked
  away from them but didn''t move.'
- ! '"You''re a right clever clogs.'
- But this isn't hell, Rita."
- ! '"You don''t understand, I say that without fear," Rita explained.'
- ! '"Jahannam will play its tricks, and there''ll be times when I want to run and
  scream.'
- But I've tried to live a good life and that knowledge keeps me sane, despite the
  monsters in the bonkers rooms."
- ! '"Gibbis…" Rita trailed off when the Doctor recovered from his gargling and swallowed
  as he looked at her and she resumed, "…is an alien, isn''t he?"'
- ! '"Yeah.'
- Sorry."
- ! '"Ok, I''m going to file that under ''freak out about later''."'
- ! '"The Dalek wasn''t your room, was it?"'
- ! '"I don''t think so, no," she murmured, not looking at him.'
- ! '"Liv, now might be a good time to tell me that secret I don''t know."'
- ! '"Oh, right, so we can have it out in front of everyone?'
- Including Little Miss Clever Clogs over there?"
- ! '"We''ve been over this," he sighed, glancing over his shoulder at the group.'
- ! '"I like people that can handle situations like this without panicking, but that
  doesn''t mean you should be jealous."'
- ! '"You were quick to ''fire'' Amy."'
- ! '"You know I wouldn''t, and stop trying to distract me from what I asked you."'
- ! '"Maybe I''m not in the mood to tell you, ever think about that?"'
- ! '"Olivia Felton, your stubbornness never fails to annoy and attract me at the
  same time," he growled in her ear then sighed and softened his tone.'
- ! '"Please, my love?"'
- ! '"We can get through it, Liv," he whispered.'
- ! '"Whatever it is, after everything we''ve been through, we can get through it.'
- You have to believe that, and trust me."
- She smiled sadly before murmuring, "I've always trusted you."
- ! '"So, what''s this secret, hm?"'
- ! '"Doctor, look at this," Amy called, holding two pieces of paper toward him.'
- ! '"I found it in a corridor.'
- I completely forgot I had it."
- ! '"''My name is Lucy Hayward,''" he read.'
- ! '"''I''m the last one left.'
- Praise him.'"
- ! '"Praise him," Howie blurted from his seat at one of the tables, fiddling with
  the silverware and everyone''s eyes shot to him.'
- ! '"What did you say?"'
- ! '"Nothing," Howie lied, shaking his head then looked like he was trying to keep
  from throwing up before blurting out, "Praise him!"'
- ! '"This is what happened to Joe!"'
- ! '"Oh, it''s gonna come for me now," Howie panicked, pacing.'
- ! '"He''ll lead it to us," Gibbis panicked as well.'
- ! '"Just calm down a minute," Rita implored.'
- ! '"He''ll lead it right here!"'
- ! '"I won''t leave you," the Doctor assured Howie.'
- ! '"I promise."'
- ! '"Listen, Howie," Olivia insisted.'
- ! '"You have my word on that."'
- ! '"I don''t want to get eaten," Howie shuddered.'
- ! '"Thank you, Liv," the Doctor nodded, rubbing his ear.'
- ! '"Don''t you see?"'
- ! '"He''ll lead it right here!"'
- ! '"What do you suggest?"'
- ! '"Look, whatever it is out there, it''s obviously chosen Howard as its next course,"
  Gibbis replied.'
- ! '"Now, tragic though that is, this is no time for sentiment.'
- I'm saying if it were to find him, it may be satisfied and let the rest of us go."
- Everyone stared at him incredulously making him huff and plop into a seat, explaining,
  "All I wanna do is go home and be conquered and oppressed.
- Is that too much to ask?!"
- ! '"Tell you what, when you start Praising Him, we''ll do exactly as you say, ok?"'
- ! '"It''s ok," Rita chimed in as Olivia wrapped an arm around Howie''s shoulders.'
- ! '"I''ll stay with Howie.'
- You take the others and go."
- ! '"No, we stay together," the Doctor objected before stepping toward Gibbis as
  he still sat.'
- ! '"Your civilization is one of the oldest in the galaxy.'
- Right?"
- Gibbis nodded, making the Doctor grin, "Brilliant."
- ! '"If it were up to me, you''d be left for it when your praises start," she ground
  out before pushing off of him and following the Doctor as he wrapped an arm around
  Howie to lead him to the table.'
- ! '"Howie, any second now, it''s going to possess you again," the Doctor explained,
  sitting Howie down.'
- ! '"When it does, I''m going to ask you some questions.'
- Please try to answer them."
- ! '"I hope my mum''s alright," Howie said.'
- ! '"Sh-She''s gonna be w-worried."'
- He suddenly looked dazed, making Olivia frown at him in wonder before calling, "Howie?
- Howie, you ok?"
- ! '"Liv, let him be," the Doctor whispered, seeing what was happening to him, and
  Howie grinned at him in a daze.'
- ! '"Howie, you''re next.'
- Why isn't he possessing all of us?"
- ! '"You guys have got all these distractions," Howie explained, tapping his head
  and giggling.'
- ! '"All these obstacles.'
- Clear the path."
- ! '"You want it to find you, even though you know what it''s gonna do?"'
- ! '"Are you kidding?"'
- ! '"He''s going to kill us all.'
- How cool is that?!"
- ! '"It''s as I thought," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"It feeds on fear.'
- But do not give in to the fear."
- ! '"Ok, but what are we gonna do?"'
- ! '"We''re gonna catch ourselves a monster," he smirked.'
- ! '"Bring me death!"'
- ! '"Bring me glory!'
- Give it to me now."
- ! '"You sure this is a good idea?"'
- ! '"I know it''s the Doctor''s plan and everything but…"'
- ! '"Rory, I call him an idiot for a reason," Olivia murmured.'
- ! '"Comforting," he retorted.'
- ! '"Not here to comfort.'
- Here to block the door."
- ! '"I want him to know my devotion," Howie continued from somewhere.'
- ! '"How are we gonna defend ourselves if it goes wrong?"'
- ! '"Well, I''ve got a Sonic Screwdriver," she replied.'
- ! '"Great…and I''ve got a mop."'
- ! '"Well, it''s better than nothing."'
- ! '"Rory!'
- He's in!"
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Do your apart, Rory."'
- ! '"Why are you—?!"'
- ! '"Because I''m an idiot, too, now go!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?"'
- ! '"Not leaving you to that thing," she shot back.'
- ! '"Let his name be the last thing I hear," Howie continued from the PA system and
  into the room as the Doctor grabbed Olivia''s hand and dragged her with him to shut
  off the lights.'
- ! '"Let his breath on my skin be the last thing I feel."'
- ! '"I was lost in shadows, but he found me.'
- Praise him."
- ! '"That''s quite enough of that," the Doctor muttered, pulling the plug on the
  PA before turning to the Minotaur.'
- ! '"Nothing personal.'
- Why?"
- ! '"Did you say they take?"'
- ! '"Ah, what is that word?'
- The guard?"
- ! '"Warden?"'
- ! '"This is a prison.'
- Lunch?"
- ! '"We are not…ripe?"'
- ! '"That''s what Joe said," Olivia breathed, clutching his arm as he stepped toward
  the glass with water running over it.'
- ! '"He said we weren''t ready."'
- ! '"So what, what, you make us…ready, you, what?"'
- ! '"Replace?'
- Fear?"
- ! '"You have lived…so long, even your name is lost," the Doctor translated again.'
- ! '"He wants to stop," Olivia realized in a breath.'
- ! '"Because you are…" the Doctor prompted the Minotaur then said, "…just instinct.'
- Tell me how to fight you."
- ! '"My Master," they suddenly heard Howie call…and he sounded very close.'
- ! '"My Lord, I''m here!'
- Bring me death!"
- ! '"How did he get out?!"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Rory, look out!"'
- ! '"Stay back!"'
- ! '"Pond, bring the fish."'
- ! '"Rory!'
- Are you ok?!"
- ! '"Where''d he go?"'
- ! '"Somebody…hit me," Rory breathed, slightly dazed.'
- ! '"Was it Amy?"'
- ! '"Liv, stay with him!"'
- ! '"Oh, hell no," Olivia ground out, scrambling to her feet and rushing after him.'
- ! '"I told you to stay with Rory," he recalled when she caught up with him.'
- ! '"Yeah, you tell me lots of things," she retorted as he stood, examining the glasses.'
- ! '"Find Howie?"'
- ! '"Not yet, come on."'
- ! '"He got free," Gibbis explained, ''innocently.'''
- ! '"He overpowered me."'
- ! '"You liar!"'
- ! '"It might leave us alone now!"'
- ! '"Maybe now we''ll be safe.'
- Wait!"
- ! '"Doctor, let me go!'
- I'm gonna beat him to a pulp, I swear!"
- ! '"Olivia, stop it," he ordered, firmly as she cried, bowing her head into her
  hands.'
- ! '"I can''t lose you to hysteria.'
- You've got to stop, please."
- ! '"I''m sorry," she shuddered.'
- ! '"I promise you can break down when all of this is over and we''re back in the
  TARDIS," he assured her with a smile, making her giggle and nod.'
- ! '"There''s my girl.'
- Let's get Howie to the dining hall, yeah?"
- ! '"I have a feeling, Theta," she whispered.'
- ! '"Tell me," he requested, pulling her closer and placing his chin on her head.'
- ! '"My room is close, and it''s gonna come for me next."'
- ! '"Such a pessimist," he muttered.'
- ! '"You know what I say about them, don''t you?"'
- ! '"I''m serious," she insisted.'
- ! '"You know I''m perceptive."'
- ! '"Liv, I know you are, and I know you''re frightened, but you need to be my brave
  girl for me now.'
- We always get out of it."
- ! '"Have you found your room yet?"'
- ! '"No," he replied then asked, "Is that good or bad?"'
- ! '"Maybe you''re not scared of anything," the Doctor guessed.'
- ! '"Well, after all the time I spent with you in the TARDIS what was left to be
  scared of?"'
- ! '"Rory, you used past tense," Olivia voiced.'
- ! '"No, I didn''t," Rory frowned before gazing over the pictures and saying, "You
  know, Howie had been in speech therapy.'
- I'd forgotten not all victories are about saving the universe."
- ! '"Liv, what''s—?!"'
- ! '"I need you to kiss me," she shuddered, making him swallow, seeing the tears
  in her eyes.'
- ! '"Please, Theta.'
- I feel like it's all gonna go to—"
- ! '"Rita!"'
- ! '"Brilliant!'
- How are you?"
- ! '"Not as good as you two," she smirked as Olivia took in a breath, finally coming
  out of her daze to take the Doctor''s hand in hers.'
- ! '"Not panicking, are you?"'
- ! '"Good, good.'
- Because I'm literally an otter's toenail away from getting us out of here."
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Excellent question," the Doctor replied, pulling Olivia with him as he started
  down the stairs, passing Rita then turning back to her.'
- ! '"Why…what?"'
- ! '"Why is it up to you to save us?"'
- ! '"That''s quite a God Complex you have, there."'
- ! '"You have no idea," Olivia scoffed, but she frowned when his grip tightened on
  her hand and she looked up at him as he stared at her, then looked to Amy who was
  setting up a fish bowl on a table.'
- ! '"I brought them here," he replied, turning back to Rita and slinging an arm over
  Olivia''s shoulders.'
- ! '"They''d say it was their choice, but offer a child a suitcase full of sweets
  and they''ll take it.'
- Offer someone all of time and space, and they'll take that, too…which is why you
  shouldn't."
- Olivia frowned up at him in confusion as his arm slipped from her shoulders and
  he took her hand again, adding with a sneer, "Which is why grown-ups were invented."
- ! '"All of time and space, eh?"'
- ! '"Oh, yeah," the Doctor grinned, swinging his and Olivia''s hands back and forth
  between them, and Olivia couldn''t help but smile at him.'
- ! '"And when we get out of this, I''ll show you, too."'
- ! '"I don''t know what you''re talking about, but whatever it was, I have a feeling
  you just did it again," Rita smirked, making him laugh, softly before he looked
  past her and up in a corner.'
- ! '"Right down to the smallest detail," he murmured, pointing to the security camera
  and making the girls look to it before he pulled Olivia down the stairs with him.'
- ! '"Got you, Mr.'
- Minotaur."
- The Doctor dragged Olivia through the halls and she stumbled after him before questioning,
  "Where are we going?"
- ! '"Surveillance room!"'
- ! '"Theta, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"No!'
- Theta, don't!"
- ! '"Just stay here, Olivia," he urged, pulling her to one side of the door, her
  back pressed to the wall so she couldn''t see what was in the room.'
- ! '"I''ll only have a peek."'
- ! '"No, don''t," she argued.'
- ! '"It''s too risky."'
- ! '"Of course," he whispered, then smirked, "Who else?"'
- ! '"Theta, what was it?"'
- ! '"You have your secrets, I have mine," he smirked before they turned into a door
  filled with screens with images of the hotel.'
- ! '"Oh, you beauty!'
- Come on, big fella, where are you?"
- They both searched the screens, but Olivia frowned in wonder when she saw Rita wandering
  the halls and asked, "Where's Rita going?"
- ! '"Rita, where are you going?"'
- ! '"Oh, can you take the phone into the corridor?'
- Will it reach?"
- ! '"You started to praise it, didn''t you?"'
- ! '"Rita, come back, please.'
- We'll find a way to stop it, I swear to you."
- ! '"No, I need to get as far away from you all as possible," Rita replied, sinking
  to the floor against the wall.'
- ! '"No, you don''t.'
- The creature only wants whoever's praising him."
- ! '"And then you''ll put yourself in its way."'
- ! '"We''re coming to get you.'
- Block out the fear and stay focused on your belief."
- ! '"The hotel will keep us apart.'
- I could be fifty miles away by now."
- ! '"Doctor," Olivia whispered, tugging on his arm and pointing to one of the screens
  where she saw the Minotaur crossing the camera''s view.'
- ! '"I want you to do me one last favor, Doctor.'
- I want you to remember me the way I was."
- ! '"What''s going on?'
- Rita's disappeared," Amy reported urgently, stepping into the room with Rory then
  looked to the screens and saw her.
- ! '"What''s she doing there?"'
- ! '"Rita.'
- Let me find you."
- ! '"You stay where you are," Rita ordered him, shaking her head as tears welled
  in her eyes.'
- ! '"Please, let me be robbed of my faith in private."'
- ! '"Look, Rita, go into the room, lock the door!"'
- ! '"I''m not frightened.'
- Goodbye, Doctor."
- ! '"Rita!"'
- ! '"Thank you for trying."'
- ! '"Rita, please!"'
- ! '"Ok," he murmured.'
- ! '"It preys on people''s fear and possesses them."'
- ! '"But Rita wasn''t afraid," Olivia recalled.'
- ! '"She was calm the entire time."'
- ! '"Maybe it''s something to do with the people," he theorized.'
- ! '"Some connection between the four of you.'
- That'll tell me how to fight it."
- ! '"Yes, you keep saying that, but you never do," Gibbis complained, making Olivia
  turn a glare to him.'
- ! '"And while we wait, people keep dying, and we''ll be next!"'
- ! '"Shut your trap," Olivia snapped, making the Doctor squeeze her hand reassuringly.'
- ! '"Look, he''ll work it out," Amy assured Gibbis.'
- ! '"He always does.'
- Just let him riff, and move anything expensive out of his way."
- ! '"Oh, no," he murmured, making Olivia look back at him and she knew he''d figured
  it out.'
- ! '"Doctor, what is it?"'
- ! '"It''s not fear," he began before swallowing, making her frown at him in wonder.'
- ! '"It''s faith."'
- ! '"Faith?"'
- ! '"Not just religious faith, faith in something," he explained.'
- ! '"Howard believed in conspiracies, that external forces controlled the world.'
- They all believe there's something guiding them about to save them."
- ! '"That''s what it replaces," Olivia realized, standing to be face to face with
  him as they spoke.'
- ! '"Every time someone was confronted with their most primal fear they fell back
  on their most fundamental faith," the Doctor sighed, placing his hands on her shoulders
  with a pained expression.'
- ! '"And all this time, I have been telling you to dig deep, find the thing that
  keeps you brave.'
- I made you expose your faith, show them what they needed."
- ! '"But why us?"'
- ! '"Why are we here?"'
- ! '"It doesn''t want you," the Doctor replied, lowering his hands from Olivia''s
  shoulders to face them.'
- ! '"That''s why it kept showing you a way out.'
- You're not religious or superstitious, so there's no faith for you to fall back
  on…it wants the girls."
- ! '"Us?"'
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Amy''s faith in me," he replied, glancing to Olivia but she didn''t move.'
- ! '"Olivia''s love for me.'
- That's what brought us here."
- ! '"But why do they lose their faith before they die and start worshipping…it?"'
- ! '"It needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Faith is an energy, the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live,
  which is why, at the end of her note, Lucy said…"'
- ! '"Praise him."'
- ! '"Exactly."'
- ! '"No, Olivia," he breathed, shaking his head in disbelief.'
- ! '"I told you," she shuddered.'
- ! '"I told you!"'
- ! '"Olivia, come on!"'
- ! '"God, but he''s gorgeous," she breathed.'
- ! '"Doctor, in here!"'
- ! '"No, no, no, no, no!"'
- ! '"Not again!'
- I can't take it, please!"
- ! '"Olivia, what is this?!"'
- ! '"I hate it when you regenerate!"'
- ! '"I know it''s terrible, but I hate it!'
- Not again!"
- ! '"My head!"'
- ! '"It''s in my head, Doctor.'
- Make it stop!"
- ! '"Doctor!'
- It's coming in!"
- ! '"Olivia, look at me," he ordered, grabbing her head in both hands and forcing
  her gaze to his, tears streaming down her face.'
- ! '"None of this was meant to happen.'
- You were an audience I could play to, understand?"
- Olivia stared at him in confusion before breathing, "What?"
- ! '"It went too far, Olivia," he kept on, ignoring the slam of the door being flung
  open by the Minotaur and kept his eyes on hers.'
- ! '"And now this?'
- This is my life."
- ! '"I know, I''m—!"'
- ! '"I''m taking you back home," he cut in, lowering his hands from her head as she
  stared wide eyes of disbelief at him as he stood and she scrambled to her feet.'
- ! '"Theta—!"'
- ! '"When this is over, I''m taking you home," he said again as she still stared
  at him.'
- ! '"Olivia," Amy murmured, kneeling next to her and wrapping her arms around her
  as Olivia shook her head in disbelief.'
- ! '"I knew he''d hate me!"'
- ! '"I knew he wouldn''t want me when he found out!"'
- ! '"Olivia, you can''t say that," Rory told her, kneeling on the other side of her.'
- ! '"He''s trying to save us.'
- I know you see why he said those things."
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"How could you do this to me?!"'
- Olivia screamed at the Doctor, slapping him again then pounding her fists to his
  chest with all her strength, chanting, "I hate you!
- I hate you!"
- He lifted his hands and wrestled with her until he was able to wrap his arms around
  her and she sunk against him, shaking her head, shuddering, "I hate you."
- ! '"Liv," he whispered before swallowing.'
- ! '"No!"'
- Everyone's attention finally turned to the Minotaur at the Doctor's feet and Amy
  asked, "What is it, a Minotaur or an alien?
- That's not a question I thought I'd be asking this morning."
- ! '"It''s…" the Doctor trailed off, staring at Olivia before swallowing and finally
  tearing his gaze from her to bend down and pick up her ring, tucking it into his
  pocket then looking toward the computer to his left.'
- ! '"It''s both, actually.'
- Here we go."
- ! '"Olivia, you ok?"'
- ! '"I mean…you''re not ok, but…I mean—"'
- ! '"Amy, permission to hug?"'
- ! '"Granted," Amy replied without hesitation and Olivia threw her arms around Rory,
  making him grunt when she rammed into his chest.'
- ! '"A distant cousin of the Nimon," the Doctor read the symbols.'
- ! '"They descend on planets and set themselves up as gods to be worshipped, which
  is fine until the inhabitants get all secular and advanced enough to build bonkers
  prisons."'
- ! '"Correction," Rory called, looking to the window at his feet as Olivia still
  clung to him.'
- ! '"Prisons in space."'
- ! '"Where are the guards?"'
- ! '"No need for any," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"It''s all automated.'
- It drifts through space, snatching people with belief systems, and converts their
  faith into food for the creature."
- ! '"See that planet, there?"'
- ! '"The green one, there.'
- That's where I'm from."
- ! '"They didn''t want just us, so you must believe in some god, or someone, or they''d
  have shown you the door, too," Amy observed, speaking to the Doctor.'
- ! '"So what do Time Lords pray to?"'
- ! '"According to the in-flight recorder, the program developed glitches," he explained,
  avoiding the question.'
- ! '"It got stuck on the same setting.'
- The fears from the people before us weren't tidied away."
- ! '"What''s it saying?"'
- ! '"An ancient creature," the Doctor translated.'
- ! '"Drenched in the blood of the innocent, drifting in space, through an endless
  shifting maze.'
- For such a creature death would be a gift."
- The Doctor knelt down and gripped one of its hands, murmuring, "Then accept it and
  sleep well."
- ! '"I wasn''t talking about myself," he translated, and he a faltered a moment before
  stepping toward the TARDIS where Gibbis stood and Olivia still sat in front of it.'
- ! '"Could I have a lift?"'
- ! '"Just to the nearest galaxy will do."'
- ! '"Sure," the Doctor nodded, opening the door and letting Amy, Rory and Gibbis
  head in before him.'
- ! '"Time to go, Liv."'
- ! '"She thinks you meant it," Amy reported to the Doctor as he kept his focus on
  the console and he didn''t say anything.'
- ! '"Doctor."'
- ! '"Yes, Amy, I heard," he finally replied, still not looking at her.'
- ! '"I''ll take care of it.'
- Let's get Gibbis home."
- ! '"We''re at their house," he reported.'
- ! '"They won''t even step out the door without you being there.'
- It was your idea to make their door TARDIS blue."
- ! '"I know…you''re still angry with me," he began.'
- ! '"Well, ''angry'' is probably an understatement, but I want you to keep this."'
- ! '"Don''t tell me," Amy began.'
- ! '"This isn''t Earth, that isn''t a real house, and inside lives a goblin who feeds
  on indecision."'
- ! '"No," the Doctor chirped, reaching into his pocket.'
- ! '"Real Earth.'
- Real door keys."
- ! '"You''re not serious," she questioned, and Olivia couldn''t help but smile at
  their reactions.'
- ! '"The car, too?"'
- ! '"That…That''s my favorite car.'
- How did you know that was my favorite car?"
- ! '"You showed me a picture of it once and said, ''This is my favorite car,''" the
  Doctor replied, tossing the keys to it to him as they strolled toward it and Rory
  giggled excitedly.'
- ! '"You''re welcome," Olivia smiled, before Rory grabbed her and hugged her tightly
  in excitement and she couldn''t help but giggle when he released her.'
- ! '"Rory," Amy called, stepping toward him, asking, "Can you give us a few minutes?'
- Two minutes."
- ! '"She''ll say that we can''t accept it because it''s too extravagant, and we''ll
  always feel a crippling sense of obligation," he murmured, glancing between them
  before looking to Amy as she leaned on the hood of the car then turned back to them,
  whispering, "It''s a risk I''m willing to take."'
- ! '"I''m just gonna wait in the TARDIS," Olivia assured them, turning to head back
  and the Doctor watched her until she disappeared through the door before he turned
  back to Amy.'
- ! '"Hey," she called, patting the hood next to her and he strolled toward her to
  sit against the car.'
- ! '"So…you''re leaving, aren''t you?"'
- ! '"You haven''t seen the last of me," he assured her.'
- ! '"''Bad Penny'' is my middle name.'
- Seriously, the looks I get when I fill in a form."
- ! '"Why now?"'
- ! '"Because you''re still…breathing."'
- ! '"Well, I think this is about the washing-up, personally."'
- ! '"I mean, you''re right, there''s still heaps of stuff out there to look at.'
- Do you know, there's a planet whose name literally translates as 'Volatile Circus'?"
- Amy laughed before he added, "Or maybe there's a bigger, scarier adventure waiting
  for you in there."
- ! '"Even so, it…can''t happen like this," Amy insisted as she stood as well.'
- ! '"After everything we''ve been through, Doctor, everything…you can''t just drop
  me off at my house and say goodbye like we shared a cab."'
- ! '"And what''s the alternative?'
- Over your broken body, over Rory's body?"
- ! '"If you bump into my daughter, tell her to visit her old mum sometime," she smiled,
  making him chuckle before she punched his shoulder.'
- ! '"And you better make up with Olivia."'
- He nodded before telling her, "Look after him."
- ! '"Look after her…and you," Amy nodded before pressing a kiss to his forehead and
  he turned to head toward the TARDIS.'
- ! '"Olivia," he called and she stopped on the step as he hurried out from around
  the console.'
- ! '"Where are you going?"'
- ! '"To pack my things," she replied and he could hear the lump in her throat even
  if she didn''t turn to face him.'
- ! '"Just the things I brought from home."'
- ! '"Not yet," he argued, heading up the stairs and stopping behind her.'
- ! '"I have some questions for you."'
- ! '"Liv, let me see those gorgeous jades," he murmured, and she cursed herself for
  not having a better resistance against him.'
- ! '"There''s my girl.'
- Yes or no."
- ! '"First question," he began, his hand on her chin trailing slowly up to her cheek
  to stroke it, gently.'
- ! '"Do you want to stay?"'
- She swallowed again, feeling more tears come to her eyes before she shuddered, "Yes."
- ! '"Are you still angry?"'
- ! '"…No."'
- ! '"Do you…still love me?"'
- Olivia's eyes shifted as more tears rolled down her cheeks before she finally whispered,
  "It hurt…hearing you say those things.
- I…I shouldn't have said that."
- ! '"I know I hurt you," he murmured.'
- ! '"But I had to do it to save all of us.'
- I'll never, ever hurt you like that again."
- ! '"You can''t say that, Theta."'
- ! '"Yes, I can."'
- ! '"No, you can''t, not when I know you''re going to die!"'
- ! '"Of course I still love you.'
- I shouldn't have thrown my ring at you either."
- ! '"I deserved it," he murmured.'
- ! '"No, you didn''t," she argued, shaking her head and pulling back enough to look
  up at him, gripping his jacket.'
- ! '"Whatever you do, whatever you say, you don''t deserve that from me."'
- ! '"Then I deserved the slaps," he conceded.'
- ! '"And the punches.'
- Do you forgive me, Liv?"
- She nodded then said, "Only if you forgive me for…hating it when you regenerate."
- ! '"Please don''t leave me," she breathed, unable to help voicing her thoughts.'
- ! '"Oh, no, Liv," he whispered, lifting his hands to cup her face.'
- ! '"I was just about to let you in on another secret of mine."'
- ! '"I hate it when I regenerate, too.'
- Don't feel bad."
- ! '"You won''t be able to move by the time I''m done with you, wife."'
- ! '"I think I can keep up with you, husband."'
- ! '"I know you can."'
- ! '"Now, put your hands up!"'
- she sang as she flipped the pancake using only the pan then put it back over the
  fire as she sang, "Oh, oh, oh."
- ! '"Ooh, this brings back memories," the Doctor crooned in her ear as he came up
  behind her to wrap his arms around her waist, snuggling against her and she noticed
  he wasn''t wearing a shirt, only his purple suspenders and trousers.'
- ! '"Cybermen."'
- ! '"Tomato shots," she smiled, sliding the pancake onto the stack on the plate next
  to her.'
- ! '"You know that was the last time I had one?"'
- ! '"We''ll have to remedy that when we get to Barcelona," he smiled as she shut
  the flame off and she turned in his arms to stare wide eyes at him.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"We''re going back," he nodded, pulling her closer by the waist.'
- ! '"The festival!"'
- ! '"I can''t wait!"'
- ! '"What are you making?"'
- ! '"I made custard pancakes," she murmured, pressing a kiss to his lips.'
- ! '"Mm, with fish fingers?"'
- ! '"That''s them," Olivia smiled, turning to the oven to grab a potholder from the
  countertop before bending down to open the oven.'
- ! '"Like the view?"'
- ! '"Always," he smirked, taking her hand and pulling her to the center of the kitchen
  as the song continued and he tried to dance to it with her, making her giggle.'
- ! '"You can''t move to this music," she laughed, making him pout at her.'
- ! '"Track six, if ya would, dear."'
- ! '"Keep it loose, Liv!"'
- ! '"Keep it loose!"'
- ! '"Take these to the dining room, I''ll get the fish fingers," she laughed, pressing
  a kiss to his cheek as he took the plate.'
- ! '"Custard pancakes, but no custard to dip the fish fingers in?"'
- He stared at her with wide eyes before grinning, "Olivia Felton, you are brilliant,
  you are!"
- ! '"I know," she smirked, taking a bite of her fish finger pancake taco as he made
  one for himself.'
- ! '"When we get to Barcelona, first thing I wanna do is go shopping, with you this
  time," she smiled as they ate.'
- ! '"Your wish is my command, Princess," he smirked, making her giggle.'
- ! '"Back to calling me that," she smiled, looking up at him.'
- ! '"I like it."'
- ! '"I know you do," he retorted, giving her an Eskimo kiss, and for the first time
  in a long time she felt like that giddy teenager she used to be, sitting with her
  Highwayman.'
- ! '"What about this one, Doctor?"'
- ! '"It''s the same color as your Sonic Screwdriver."'
- ! '"Do you like it?"'
- ! '"Yes, but you have to look at me in it," she retorted.'
- ! '"I want your opinion, too."'
- ! '"You look gorgeous in anything, Liv," he smiled as they strolled away.'
- ! '"If you like it, I like it."'
- ! '"Aren''t we gonna pay for it?"'
- ! '"I''ve got it covered, darling," he assured her.'
- ! '"They''re putting it on my tab.'
- Or someone's tab, anyway."
- ! '"That-That dog had no nose," she blurted, looking up at him.'
- ! '"Yes, I know," he nodded before his eyes lit up and he lowered his arm from her
  shoulders to grab her hand.'
- ! '"Ooh!'
- Come on!"
- ! '"We could match!"'
- ! '"Well, what do you think, Liv?"'
- ! '"Liv?"'
- ! '"You look smart, Doctor," she called, behind him, making him whirl around and
  smile at her as she stood with her hands behind her back and a smile over her lips.'
- ! '"What have you got behind your back, then?"'
- ! '"I thought you''d like one, since they''re cool," she smiled before he snatched
  the thing away from her with one hand and wrapped his other hand around her waist
  to pull her close.'
- ! '"Olivia Felton, you are smashing!"'
- ! '"Well, now how do I look?"'
- ! '"Very cool, my love," she nodded before he stepped toward her and threw an arm
  over her shoulders again.'
- ! '"Let''s get back to the TARDIS so you can change into that lovely dress then,
  eh?"'
- ! '"Olivia, I love you," he sighed, making her smile grow even wider.'
- ! '"I love you, too, Theta," she whispered, her hand slipping down his chin to rest
  on his chest over one of his hearts, feeling it pound against her palm.'
- ! '"I''m gonna go change.'
- I'll be right back."
- ! '"Need help?"'
- ! '"Bad boy," she smirked back with a wink as she turned and hurried up the stairs
  to the platform then hurried up the stairs leading deeper into the TARDIS with her
  dress.'
- ! '"Oh, lover boy!"'
- ! '"How do I look?'
- Should I wear my Converse or do you like the heels?"
- ! '"Love the heels," he confessed, reaching into his jacket and pulling out his
  Sonic, adding, "You match my screwdriver."'
- ! '"Theta, what''s the matter?"'
- ! '"Talk to me."'
- ! '"It''s coming up soon, Liv," he breathed, lifting a hand to run his fingers through
  her hair, soothingly.'
- ! '"I''m sorry we didn''t get to have little ones running around the TARDIS before
  I had to go."'
- ! '"I have no regrets about our life together," she stated, firmly as she gripped
  the lapels of his jacket.'
- ! '"Even if we didn''t get to have children like I''d wanted—"'
- ! '"We wanted, Liv," he corrected.'
- ! '"I wanted it, too."'
- ! '"Even if it didn''t happen, I don''t regret any of it," she resumed.'
- ! '"From the moment I met you, until now, I don''t regret any of it.'
- Let's go have a good time at the Festival."
- ! '"Never think about what could have, or should have been," she sighed.'
- ! '"You''ll only drive yourself insane thinking of ''what ifs.'''
- Just remember the times we've had and how much fun we've had together."
- ! '"I want you to do something for me, Liv," he whispered, making her lift her head
  away from his to look him in the eye.'
- ! '"After I…you know, I want you to find Jack and…stay with him.'
- He'll protect you the way I have and he'll care about you and maybe you two can—"
- ! '"Stop right there," Olivia snapped, her jaw set and her eyes narrowing to a glare.'
- ! '"You say one more word and I''ll slap you upside the head.'
- Am I perfectly clear?"
- ! '"Alright, Liv," he nodded, still smirking.'
- ! '"Let''s go have fun and get you your Tomato shots.'
- I know you've been dying to have one since we got here."
- ! '"Surprise!"'
- ! '"And thanks for the birthday wishes, mom," she murmured before pulling away to
  let Aaron hug her as well, taking his small suitcase from him.'
- ! '"You think I''d miss my twenty-fourth birthday with my mom?'
- Not a chance!"
- ! '"Hello, Joyce, how are you?"'
- ! '"I''m…fine," she blurted, still in shock before she turned her gaze to Aaron
  and Olivia, finally grinning.'
- ! '"You''re all here!'
- I haven't heard from either of you in ages!"
- ! '"Ah, Olivia''s absence was my fault," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"I''ve been keeping her busy.'
- Sorry."
- ! '"I''ll slap you later," Joyce smiled, giving him a wink to tell him she was joking
  and he chuckled.'
- ! '"Hey, Joyce!"'
- ! '"I can''t find the—Oh."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Jack came back for a visit," Joyce explained.'
- ! '"He could tell I was lonely, so he decided to stay for a while."'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"Are you kidding me?!"'
- ! '"Look, guys, it''s not what you think," Jack tried explaining.'
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"You idiot!"'
- ! '"What do you think you''re doing?!"'
- ! '"Defending the honor of his mother in-law!"'
- ! '"Honor?!"'
- ! '"What—?!"'
- ! '"They think we slept together," Jack explained, sounding nasal as he pinched
  the bridge of his bleeding nose and tilted his head back.'
- ! '"You''re all being ridiculous!"'
- ! '"He knew it was Olivia''s birthday and when he saw I was by myself he asked if
  he could stay and have a glass of the wine he brought for Olivia, hoping she''d
  be here!"'
- ! '"Why is he half naked?!"'
- ! '"He spilled his wine," Joyce shot back, meeting his gaze.'
- ! '"I''m washing his clothes!'
- Look, Jack is charming and sweet and handsome, but I'm not going to sleep with him
  just because I'm lonely!"
- ! '"And I''m not gonna take advantage of her, even if she is sexy as hell," Jack
  added, giving a wink to Joyce, making her roll her eyes.'
- ! '"You''re as bad as Aaron sometimes," Joyce sighed, standing and pulling Jack
  to his feet to lead him by the arm.'
- ! '"Let''s get you cleaned up and stop the bleeding."'
- ! '"We should get ice for your hand," Olivia told the Doctor who nodded, letting
  her lead him down the stairs by the arm as he cradled his hand, sighing again, "You
  idiot."'
- ! '"Aaron!'
- Get in here!"
- ! '"Aaron, hold this for Jack."'
- ! '"Send that to me!"'
- ! '"Duh," he blurted, turning his phone back around to do so as Olivia leaned over
  the Doctor''s hand again.'
- ! '"Alright, you three, apologize to Jack," Joyce ordered, approaching Jack with
  a wet paper towel to wipe the blood that had splattered onto his chest from his
  nose.'
- ! '"I''ll do it," Aaron told her, making her frown at him but he only took the paper
  towel from her to start, slowly wiping the blood from Jack''s chest.'
- ! '"This is my apology."'
- ! '"Accepted…gladly," Jack smirked under his towel.'
- ! '"I''m sorry I punched you," the Doctor muttered before rubbing his thumb over
  his Psychic wedding band to tell Olivia, But it felt kinda nice.'
- ! '"I''m sorry, Jack," she said.'
- ! '"You''re all forgiven," Jack replied with a wave of his hand from behind Aaron,
  then pulled his arm from around him and took the towel the red head was still holding
  over his nose from his hand to lower his head, wiping his nose with a sniffle.'
- ! '"Pretty good left hook, Doctor.'
- How long you been waiting to do that?"
- ! '"Since I found out you gave that nighty to Olivia," the Doctor shot back, making
  Olivia and Aaron both stare at him with wide eyes as Jack only chuckled.'
- ! '"How did you find out?!"'
- ! '"Gwen told me when I met you at Torchwood," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"So you knew when we went to Aurora?!"'
- ! '"Well, when you put it on I wasn''t about to complain, now was I?!"'
- ! '"Do you have to have this conversation in front of me?!"'
- ! '"I don''t want the image of you two like that in my head!"'
- ! '"Not to mention my poor brain!"'
- ! '"Some birthday this is," Olivia sighed, pulling up a chair between Jack and the
  Doctor and sitting, heavily.'
- ! '"Come home, husband punches former boss, find out that husband knew former boss
  gave me an intimate gift.'
- Lovely."
- ! '"At least I saved you some cake," Joyce assured her heading for the fridge.'
- ! '"I made a small one.'
- Jack and I ate most of it."
- ! '"Wow, thanks a lot, you handsome pig," Olivia shot at Jack who shrugged back.'
- ! '"What can I say?'
- Your mom's a mean baker," Jack smirked as Joyce placed a plate in front of Olivia,
  pulling the plastic wrap off of it, placing a fork next to the plate and a kiss
  to her head.
- ! '"Thanks, mom," Olivia smiled up at her.'
- ! '"You''re welcome, sweets," Joyce smiled back, running a hand over her head, lovingly.'
- ! '"So where are you guys coming from?"'
- ! '"Planet Barcelona," the Doctor replied as Olivia dove in to her cake.'
- ! '"We went to the Festival.'
- Best birthday present ever, if I recall correctly, right, Liv?"
- ! '"You go dancing?"'
- ! '"Tomato shots?"'
- She nodded again before swallowing her bite and adding, "Six each."
- ! '"Where are you off to next?"'
- ! '"The Alignment of Exodor," the Doctor grinned, setting the ice filled dish towel
  on the table.'
- ! '"Which means we can''t stay long."'
- ! '"We should make a visit to Craig," Olivia suggested through a mouthful of cake,
  making the Doctor frown at her.'
- ! '"Why Craig?"'
- ! '"Who''s Craig?"'
- ! '"He''s a friend of ours," Olivia explained, taking a sip of her own wine as well.'
- ! '"And we should visit him because we haven''t seen him in a while.'
- We should see how he and Sophie are doing."
- ! '"A social call?"'
- ! '"It''s what friends do," she explained as he pushed the glass away.'
- ! '"Social calls."'
- ! '"I don''t do social calls."'
- ! '"Well what do you call this, if not a social call?!"'
- ! '"A birthday present for you."'
- ! '"Another one?'
- You're so generous."
- ! '"Who is Craig?!"'
- ! '"I told you, he''s a friend of ours," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"He helped us out when the TARDIS flew off with Amy and we had to stay someplace.'
- He rented a room to us which, of course, ended up having a fake upstairs."
- ! '"Of course it did," Jack nodded along before taking a long drink of wine.'
- ! '"It ended up being a spaceship," Olivia added.'
- ! '"Of course it was," Aaron nodded as well.'
- ! '"How long are staying this time, Aaron?"'
- ! '"A week or so," he shrugged.'
- ! '"Maybe longer."'
- ! '"Glad to hear that," Jack smirked, making Aaron turn to him and bite the tip
  of his tongue at the corner of his mouth with a smirk of his own.'
- ! '"Have your shack up somewhere else, you two," Joyce chimed in, flicking Jack''s
  ear and smacking Aaron upside the head, making both flinch before she took a sip
  of her own glass of wine.'
- ! '"Zoons, let''s get outta here before that starts," Olivia muttered to the Doctor,
  standing and taking her plate to the sink.'
- ! '"Zoons?"'
- ! '"You channeling Shakespeare again?"'
- ! '"Maybe," Olivia shrugged with a small smile.'
- ! '"We''d better get going anyway," the Doctor told her.'
- ! '"The alignment''s locked in a time-stasis field.'
- We only have one chance to fly the TARDIS through."
- ! '"Well, this was…entertaining while it lasted," she smiled, stepping toward Aaron
  to kiss his forehead then hug him before hugging her mother as the Doctor followed
  her.'
- ! '"Resist the urge to shag my mother, please," Olivia muttered into his ear, causing
  him to give her what seemed like a friendly slap on the back, but it made Olivia
  grunt as she had the wind knocked out of her.'
- ! '"I''m a one person kinda guy, unless someone wants to get kinky," he replied
  in her ear before holding her at arms length as she coughed from his hard pat on
  the back and he pinched her cheek.'
- ! '"You be careful out there in time and space, Supernova."'
- ! '"Yeah—" she coughed and nodded.'
- ! '"I will."'
- ! '"Liv, you ok?"'
- the Doctor hoped, pulling her away from Jack and questioning him, "What did you
  do to her?!"
- ! '"Just gave her a friendly pat on the back," Jack shrugged with a mischievous
  smirk as Olivia took in a deep breath.'
- ! '"Go on, husband, I''ll meet you in the TARDIS," she assured him.'
- ! '"I need to talk to these three alone.'
- I'll only be a moment."
- ! '"I can''t explain why but you might not see me for a while after this," she explained
  in a hushed voice.'
- ! '"No calls, no texts, no visits, but that doesn''t mean anything''s gone wrong,
  ok?'
- I'll contact you all as soon as I can."
- ! '"Olivia, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"And where''s Amy and Rory?'
- I thought they were with you."
- ! '"We had to leave them at their place," Olivia answered, then recalled when the
  Doctor might see them again.'
- ! '"We''ll…see them soon."'
- ! '"Nova, what''s goin'' on?"'
- ! '"I told you, I can''t explain right now," she reminded him.'
- ! '"Maybe after it''s all over…when I''m home for good."'
- ! '"Home for good?"'
- ! '"You''re getting to be as bad as him, Olivia," Jack observed, irritably.'
- ! '"Just tell us!'
- What happened to the straight forward, tell it like it is, Olivia Felton that worked
  for Torchwood, huh?!"
- ! '"Things have changed, Jack," she explained.'
- ! '"I''ve come to realize the necessity of secrets.'
- I just can't tell you everything right now."
- ! '"We understand," Joyce nodded, narrowing her gaze at Jack, adding, "After all
  you''ve been through, of course we understand, don''t we, Jack?"'
- He sighed through his nose before nodding, muttering, "I guess."
- ! '"Be careful, babe," Aaron chimed in, hugging her again, then pulling away to
  let Joyce hug her again.'
- ! '"I''ll contact you when I can," she assured them.'
- ! '"Just don''t expect it to be soon."'
- ! '"Go, before you miss the alignment," Jack nodded, patting her arm before she
  turned and hurried out the door.'
- ! '"What did you tell them?"'
- ! '"Just that I won''t be in touch for a while," she replied, honestly.'
- ! '"They wanted a reason but I told them I couldn''t tell them.'
- They don't know what's going to happen."
- ! '"Good," he nodded, stepping up next to her, still not looking at her as he made
  adjustments.'
- ! '"Last thing I need is questions from the three of them."'
- ! '"Can''t blame them for worrying.'
- It only means they care."
- ! '"I know," he sighed before looking to her with a smile.'
- ! '"So, quick stop to Craig''s before we head for the alignment?"'
- ! '"I thought you don''t do social calls," she grinned, bumping shoulders with him.'
- ! '"Well, let''s try one out!"'
- ! '"What could possibly go wrong with a little social call, eh?!"'
- ! '"I wonder if they''ve gotten married yet," Olivia smiled as she and the Doctor
  stepped out of the TARDIS, shutting the door behind them.'
- ! '"You think he got the courage up to pop the question?'
- It took 'em so long to finally admit their feelings."
- ! '"I guess we''ll find out, won''t we?"'
- ! '"Did you see that?"'
- ! '"Nope.'
- This is just a social call."
- ! '"Well, yeah, but—"'
- ! '"No, Liv, social call," he cut in, knocking on the door again.'
- ! '"I''m coping on my own!"'
- ! '"Hello, Craig," the Doctor grinned.'
- ! '"We''re back."'
- ! '"She didn''t," Craig breathed.'
- ! '"How could she phone the two of you?!"'
- ! '"How could who phone us?"'
- ! '"Nobody phoned me.'
- You remember Olivia, yes?"
- He leaned into the threshold to look inside the house saying, "Oh, you redecorated.
- I don't like it."
- ! '"It''s a different house," Craig explained through a chuckle.'
- ! '"We moved."'
- ! '"Yes, that''s it," the Doctor smiled as Olivia shook her head, unable to keep
  herself from smiling.'
- ! '"By the way, hi, Craig," she smiled, stepping toward him to hug him.'
- ! '"Olivia, what are you two doing here?"'
- ! '"Social call," Olivia explained as she took the Doctor''s arm.'
- ! '"I insisted we make one since we hadn''t seen you in a while.'
- How are you?"
- ! '"I''m fine," he smiled in amused confusion.'
- ! '"This is the bit where I say we''re fine, too, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"We''re fine, too.'
- Bye!"
- ! '"Wait, Doctor—!"'
- ! '"You didn''t even tell him we''re married, now!"'
- ! '"Something''s wrong," he murmured, making her frown at him as he turned them
  and pulled her back toward the door where Craig still stood, dragging her by the
  hand past him and into the house.'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"On your own, you said," he recalled as he caught up with them before launching
  up the stairs after looking at his Sonic.'
- ! '"But you''re not.'
- You're not on your own."
- ! '"Just…shh!"'
- ! '"Increased sulfur emissions, and look at the state of this place," the Doctor
  continued, still heading up the stairs.'
- ! '"What are you not telling me?"'
- ! '"Doctor, please," Craig begged in a hushed tone.'
- ! '"Shh."'
- ! '"No, you, shh!"'
- ! '"Shh!"'
- ! '"Shh!"'
- ! '"No, you, shh!"'
- ! '"Stop shushing each other!"'
- ! '"Doctor, don''t."'
- He gripped the knob and swept in, aiming his Sonic inside as he stepped through,
  calling, "Whatever you are get off this…planet."
- ! '"You''ve woken him!"'
- ! '"Now he''ll never get back to sleep."'
- ! '"Can I?"'
- ! '"Yeah," Craig smiled.'
- ! '"Go ahead."'
- ! '"Aw, you poor thing," she pouted, hugging him close as his little arms instantly
  wrapped around her neck and she looked to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Did the bad Time Lord scare you?'
- It's ok, he's not as scary as he looks."
- ! '"He''s hungry," the Doctor blurted as she turned a smile to him, snuggling her
  cheek to the baby.'
- ! '"I''ll fix him something downstairs," Craig said, reaching for the baby but Olivia
  pulled back.'
- ! '"I got him," she smiled as his cries started to settle down.'
- ! '"I need the practice."'
- Craig and the Doctor shot wide eyes at her before Craig glanced between them in
  astonishment, questioning, "You two are—?
- Is she—?"
- ! '"Not yet," Olivia answered his stammered question, bouncing the baby in her arms.'
- ! '"But we''re planning to try.'
- We're married now."
- ! '"Congratulations!"'
- ! '"Why didn''t you say?"'
- ! '"Slipped my mind," he muttered, deftly as he stared at Olivia with wide eyes
  and Craig shook his head, scoffing in amusement as he headed out the door and Olivia
  went to follow him, but the Doctor placed a gentle hand on her shoulder before she
  passed, stopping her.'
- ! '"Why did you tell him that?"'
- ! '"Tell him what?"'
- ! '"That we''re married?'
- Because we are."
- ! '"No, about…us trying to have a baby," he corrected.'
- ! '"Because we are," she frowned in wonder, making him sigh.'
- ! '"Liv…it''s the day after tomorrow," he blurted, and he saw it register in her
  eyes what he was talking about.'
- ! '"Yeah, well…knowing you, you can avoid it pretty easily for several years," she
  muttered, stepping toward the door again, this time heading down the stairs with
  the Doctor trailing behind her.'
- ! '"So when you say on your own…" the Doctor trailed off for explanation as he opened
  the fridge and grabbed the milk carton to drink from it.'
- ! '"Yes, I meant on my own with the baby, yes, because no one thinks I can cope
  on my own, which is so unfair because…I can''t cope on my own with him," Craig replied,
  making both the Doctor and Olivia chuckle before he continued, "I can''t, he just
  cries all the time!'
- I mean, do they have off switches?!"
- ! '"Human beings?"'
- ! '"No.'
- Believe me, I've checked."
- ! '"Yeah…way too often," Olivia chimed in, stepping back toward the table as Craig
  tried to comfort the baby.'
- ! '"No, babies," Craig corrected him.'
- ! '"Same difference," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"Sometimes this works, though."'
- The Doctor leaned forward, looking at the baby and lifted a finger to his lips,
  saying, "Shh."
- ! '"Can you teach me to do that?"'
- ! '"Probably not," the Doctor retorted, making Olivia roll her eyes.'
- ! '"Oh, please, come on!'
- I am rubbish at this!"
- ! '"At what?"'
- ! '"Being a dad!"'
- ! '"You read all the books, and they tell you you''ll know what to do if you follow
  your instincts.'
- That's what this weekend's about, trying to prove to people I can do this one thing
  well."
- ! '"So what''s his name?"'
- ! '"Will I blush?"'
- ! '"No, we didn''t call him ''The Doctor,''" Craig retorted, going to the sink.'
- ! '"No, I didn''t think you would," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"He''s called Alfie."'
- ! '"Aw!'
- That's cute!"
- ! '"And what are you doing here, anyway?"'
- ! '"Yes, he likes that, ''Alfie,'' though, personally, he prefers to be called Stormageddon,
  Dark Lord of All."'
- ! '"Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"That''s what he calls himself," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"And how do you know that?"'
- ! '"He speaks Baby," Olivia smirked at him before grinning at Alfie as he grabbed
  her finger and held onto it, the Doctor standing to pace around the table.'
- ! '"Oh, of course he does," Craig muttered, sitting in the chair the Doctor vacated
  as the Doctor grabbed the pepper grinder off the counter.'
- ! '"I don''t even know when his nappy needs changing.'
- I'm the one who's supposed to be his dad."
- ! '"Yeah, he''s wondering where his mum is," the Doctor explained then asked, "Where
  is Sophie?"'
- ! '"She''s gone away with Melina for the weekend," Craig explained, rubbing his
  eyes as Olivia turned back to Alfie to make funny faces at him.'
- ! '"She needs a rest."'
- ! '"Liv, stop doing that, he doesn''t like it, makes you look unattractive," the
  Doctor said, making Olivia fix her face before just grinning widely at Alfie as
  he still clung to her finger.'
- ! '"He says he only likes attractive women to be near him.'
- You can't just call him, 'Not Mum.'"
- ! '"Not mum?!"'
- ! '"That''s you," the Doctor confirmed, finishing with his shoulders.'
- ! '"Also ''Not Mum,'' that''s me, and everybody else is…peasants.'
- That's a bit unfortunate."
- Olivia giggled as the Doctor fluffed Alfie's hair with a flare of his fingers then
  asked, "So I'm a peasant, am I?"
- ! '"Oh, no, Liv," the Doctor replied, walking around the highchair.'
- ! '"You''re the ''Hot Girl That''s Not Mum.'''
- Babies seem to think you're rather attractive."
- ! '"I can be enchanting, sometimes," she smiled with a wink at him, making him smile,
  lovingly at her.'
- ! '"What are you here for?"'
- ! '"What''s happening?"'
- ! '"Just popped in to say hello," the Doctor replied, resuming his stroll around
  the kitchen and lifting a piece of chalk from the countertop next to him.'
- ! '"You don''t do that," Craig recalled as the Doctor licked the chalk then jumped
  in surprise at the flavor.'
- ! '"I checked upstairs when we moved in.'
- Are there aliens in my fridge?"
- ! '"We just wanted to see you, Craig," she offered.'
- ! '"Cross my hearts," the Doctor added, crossing his hearts.'
- ! '"Been knocking around, me and Liv, here.'
- ! 'One last thing: popping in to see you, then we''re off to see the Alignment of
  Exodor."'
- ! '"What''s the Alignment of Exodor?"'
- ! '"Seventeen galaxies in perfect unison," the Doctor grinned, excitedly.'
- ! '"Meant to be spectacular.'
- I get one crack at flying my TARDIS straight into it, if I get my dates right, which
  I have."
- ! '"Sounds nice," Craig nodded, glancing between them.'
- ! '"A little second honeymoon for the two of you?"'
- ! '"Our entire life together has been one big honeymoon," Olivia laughed.'
- ! '"So this is me, popping in and popping out again, just being social, just having
  a laugh," the Doctor quickly explained, scanning through the paper before glancing
  at Olivia as he set it back down.'
- ! '"Never mind that."'
- ! '"Never mind what?"'
- ! '"Mmm…nothing," the Doctor lied as Craig stood to step around the table, following
  the Doctor.'
- ! '"No, you''ve noticed something," Craig realized as the Doctor placed a hand over
  his face and spin completely around on his heel, Olivia admiring the way his long
  coat flared out behind him before he turned back to Craig.'
- ! '"You''ve got your noticing face on.'
- I have nightmares about that face."
- ! '"You and me both," Olivia blurted as the Doctor groaned.'
- ! '"Nope!"'
- ! '"Given all that up.'
- I am done noticing things."
- ! '"Didn''t even notice that, for example," the Doctor went on, grabbing Olivia''s
  hand to drag her toward the door.'
- ! '"Well, got to go.'
- Goodbye, Stormageddon."
- ! '"No, wait, wait," Craig pleaded.'
- ! '"Can you do the shushing thing?"'
- ! '"No, it only works once, and only on life forms with underdeveloped brains,"
  the Doctor explained before trying to pull Olivia toward the door again.'
- ! '"That why you never used it on me?"'
- ! '"Yes.'
- You're so stubborn!"
- ! '"Hang on, you said farewell tour," Craig recalled, stopping them halfway to the
  door.'
- ! '"What do you mean, farewell—?"'
- ! '"Shh," the Doctor whispered, lifting a finger to his lips and Craig stopped mid-sentence,
  unable to finish it.'
- ! '"Bye, Craig," Olivia called as the Doctor dragged her toward the door.'
- ! '"Theta!'
- We need to help!"
- ! '"Just go.'
- Stop noticing," the Doctor muttered.
- ! '"Just go.'
- Just go."
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"No, Liv," he snapped, looking to the light.'
- ! '"Stop it.'
- No."
- ! '"Yes, you are."'
- ! '"No, I am not," he argued, reaching into his pocket for the Sonic.'
- ! '"And what I am not doing is scanning around for electrical fluctuations."'
- ! '"Sure you''re not," Olivia shot back, watching him as he looked to the results
  on his Sonic.'
- ! '"Oh, shut up, you," he muttered, marching toward the TARDIS and she hurriedly
  followed him.'
- ! '"We''re just dropping in on a friend.'
- The last thing I need right now is a patina of teleport energy."
- ! '"Theta, wait!"'
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"I''m going," he growled, gripping her arms tightly.'
- ! '"Do you hear me?'
- I'm going away now."
- ! '"No, my love," she whispered.'
- ! '"You''re not done saving them…because I''m one of them."'
- ! '"You''ll be the death of me."'
- ! '"I know, but you''ll still love me, won''t you?"'
- ! '"Of course, Sweet Liv."'
- ! '"Vroom!"'
- ! '"It goes up-tiddly-up, it goes down-diddly-down, for only £49.99.'
- But then again, it's your parents' cash, and they'll only waste it on boring stuff,
  like lamps and vegetables."
- ! '"Yawn!"'
- ! '"Ah, nobody panic," the Doctor warned.'
- ! '"But I appear to be losing control."'
- ! '"Doctor, you''re gonna hit Craig—!"'
- ! '"Oopsy, daisy," the Doctor blurted, sitting on the edge of the small table behind
  him before waving at the kids and they grouped around he and Olivia.'
- ! '"Guys, guys.'
- Uh, try in…lamps."
- ! '"Craig!"'
- ! '"What the hell are you two doing here?"'
- ! '"Oh, I''m the Doctor," the Doctor he replied, pointing to the badge attached
  to his suspenders.'
- ! '"I work in a shop now.'
- Very thoughtful, as that does happen to me."
- ! '"But you were leaving," Craig recalled.'
- ! '"The Alignment of…Exodor.'
- One chance to see it, you said."
- ! '"Well, we were on our way," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"I…saw a shop, got a job!'
- You got to live in the moment."
- ! '"Craig, look out for Yappy!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Yappy," she smiled, lifting a little robot dog as the Doctor stepped up next
  to her as she stood again.'
- ! '"He''s the robot dog."'
- ! '"Not as much fun as I remember," the Doctor added, scratching Yappy''s chin as
  if he were a real dog.'
- ! '"You look tired," Olivia told Craig, making him sigh.'
- ! '"I haven''t slept, have I?"'
- ! '"I still can''t stop him crying.'
- I even tried singing to him last night."
- ! '"Yeah, he did mention that," the Doctor replied as Alfie made little baby noises.'
- ! '"He thought you were crying, too.'
- Yappy, say goodbye to Craig and Stormageddon."
- He lifted Yappy in front of Craig's face, then waved it at Alfie, saying, "Goodbye,
  Craig!
- Goodbye Stormageddon!"
- ! '"Sorry, he didn''t get any sleep either," Olivia told Craig, apologizing for
  his odd behavior as the Doctor set Yappy down.'
- ! '"What was that?"'
- ! '"You''re here for a reason, aren''t you?"'
- ! '"You''ve noticed something, and you''re investigating it, and because it''s you
  it''s gonna be dangerous and alien."'
- ! '"Well…it might not be," Olivia replied, unconvincingly.'
- ! '"Olivia, I live here," he urged as the Doctor stepped next to her.'
- ! '"I need to know."'
- ! '"No, you don''t," the Doctor shook his head.'
- ! '"My baby lives here, my son," Craig insisted.'
- ! '"Sheila Clark went missing Tuesday," the Doctor began in a low tone.'
- ! '"Tiff Gosh, last seen Friday, Tom Luca, last seen Sunday."'
- ! '"Why is none of this on the front page?"'
- ! '"Oh, page one has exclusive on Nina, a local girl who got kicked off Britain''s
  Got Talent," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"These people are on pages seven, nineteen, twenty-two, because no one''s noticed
  yet.'
- They're far too excited about Nina's emotional journey, which, in fairness, is quite
  inspiring."
- ! '"And what else?"'
- ! '"The power fluctuations coincide with the disappearances," Olivia explained as
  they stepped out of the store and into the children''s department of the mall.'
- ! '"That''s just the council putting in new cables, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"Oh, yes," the Doctor drawled, sarcastically, hitting his head with the heel
  of his hand.'
- ! '"That''s it.'
- Wasting my time."
- ! '"Doctor, stop being an ass," Olivia warned as he pulled out his Sonic and used
  it on the lift.'
- ! '"Now, you can go home and Liv and I can go to Exodor.'
- And here's the lift."
- ! '"It says it''s out of order," Craig noticed.'
- ! '"Not anymore," the Doctor replied, pulling the tape crossed in front of the door.'
- ! '"See?'
- Here to help."
- ! '"It says danger!"'
- ! '"Oh, rubbish!"'
- ! '"Lifts aren''t dangerous."'
- ! '"Do I look like I''m stupid?"'
- ! '"Quiet, Stormy," the Doctor laughed.'
- ! '"Doctor, he''s not gonna give up," Olivia warned him making him groan in frustration.'
- ! '"Alright, there''s more," he muttered, stepping into the lift, Olivia with him
  as he used the Sonic on the control panel, hitting one of the buttons and the doors
  sealed.'
- ! '"Just between the four of us.'
- Missing people last seen in this area."
- ! '"CCTV''s been wiped," Olivia chimed in.'
- ! '"I checked."'
- ! '"A teleport?"'
- ! '"A teleport, like a beam me up teleport, like you see in Star Trek?"'
- ! '"Yup," Olivia chirped.'
- ! '"Someone''s been using a Star Trek teleport.'
- Could be disguised as anything."
- ! '"But a teleport in a shop?"'
- ! '"That''s ridiculous!"'
- ! '"What was that?"'
- ! '"Was that the lights again?"'
- ! '"Yes, that''s it.'
- It's always the lights," the Doctor replied in a high-pitched tone as he glanced
  behind Craig, Olivia's eyes shooting wide when she saw it too.
- ! '"Why did you say it like that?"'
- ! '"Like what?"'
- the Doctor replied before deepening his voice to ask again, "Like – Like – Like
  what?"
- ! '"Like that, in that high-pitched voice."'
- ! '"Just keep looking at me, Craig.'
- Right at me, just keep looking."
- ! '"Why?"'
- ! '"Well, because – because—"'
- ! '"Because he knows, Craig," she instantly said as the Doctor started adjusting
  his Sonic.'
- ! '"He knows and he''s trying to understand it."'
- ! '"Knows what?"'
- ! '"He knows that I love you," she replied, wrapping her arms around his neck and
  making the Doctor pause to stare at her with wide eyes.'
- ! '"You love me?"'
- ! '"Yes, Craig," she hurried on.'
- ! '"It''s you.'
- I came here for you."
- ! '"Me?"'
- ! '"Is that so surprising?"'
- ! '"Olivia, are you going to kiss me?"'
- ! '"Yes, Craig.'
- The Doctor's been keeping me in good practice."
- ! '"Olivia, no, I-I can''t.'
- We're both taken!"
- ! '"Oh, my god!"'
- ! '"Ok, we can just hold hands, if that makes you more comfortable!"'
- ! '"What is happening?!"'
- ! '"Well, first off, I don''t really love you, except as a friend!"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"See it!"'
- ! '"What is that?!"'
- ! '"Liv!'
- The panel!"
- ! '"Quick reverse," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Ok, what the hell just happened?!"'
- ! '"They must''ve linked the teleport relay to the lift, but I''ve fused it," the
  Doctor explained as they stepped out, Craig following behind the couple with Alfie.'
- ! '"They can''t use that again.'
- They're stuck up there on their spaceship."
- ! '"What were those things?"'
- She looked to Craig and met his gaze evenly, replying, "Cybermen."
- ! '"It''s gotta be up there, somewhere," the Doctor insisted, lowering his Sonic
  and tucking it away in his jacket.'
- ! '"I can''t get a fix.'
- It must be shielded."
- ! '"But you fused the teleport," Craig recalled.'
- ! '"You sorted it.'
- They can't come back."
- ! '"No, no, no, we just bought ourselves a little time," the Doctor corrected.'
- ! '"I''ve still gotta work out what they''re doing before I can stop it."'
- ! '"But if they''ve got the teleport and they''re that evil, why haven''t they invaded
  already?"'
- ! '"Craig, take Alfie and go," the Doctor instructed, making Olivia frown at him,
  but both turned their gaze to Craig when he responded.'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"No?"'
- ! '"No.'
- I know where's safest for me and Alfie, and that's right next to you."
- ! '"Is that so?"'
- ! '"Yeah, you always win.'
- You two are married now, I mean, that's gotta say something."
- Olivia smiled as she looked to the Doctor who gave a small chuckle, wrapping an
  arm around Olivia's shoulders, smirking, "Those were the days."
- ! '"I can help you," Craig insisted.'
- ! '"I''m staying."'
- ! '"Craig," the Doctor sighed, his expression twisting in frustration before he
  blurted, "Alright.'
- I mean, there's no immediate danger now."
- ! '"Good afternoon, Val," the Doctor greeted the woman behind the counter.'
- ! '"Hi, Val!"'
- ! '"Where am I investigating?"'
- ! '"Well, look around," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Ask questions.'
- That's why I usually take a human with me."
- ! '"So I''m your baby?"'
- ! '"You''re my baby!"'
- ! '"You ever call me a baby, I''ll slap you," Olivia muttered as Craig wheeled Alfie
  away, shaking his head in exasperation and the Doctor slung an arm around her shoulders.'
- ! '"You''re not a baby, Liv, you''re my girl," he smiled, pressing a kiss to the
  side of her head as they stepped toward Val.'
- ! '"I hope you don''t mind my saying, Doctor," Val began as the Doctor lifted a
  pair of designer sunglasses and examined them before putting them on.'
- ! '"But I think you look ever so sweet, you and your partner and the baby."'
- ! '"Partner," the Doctor echoed, whipping off the sunglasses and Olivia frowned
  between them.'
- ! '"Yes, I like it.'
- Is it better than companion?"
- ! '"Uh, Doctor," Olivia called in warning, but he held a finger to his lips as he
  glanced at her, shushing her.'
- ! '"Companion?"'
- ! '"Sounds old-fashioned.'
- There's no need to be coy these days."
- Olivia finally found her voice again and leaned on the counter to ask Val, "Have
  you seen anything unusual around here, recently?"
- ! '"Well…"'
- ! '"Yes, yes?"'
- ! '"Mary Warnock saw Dom Petheridge snogging Andrea Groom outside the conservative
  club on his so-called day off golfing."'
- ! '"Yeah," the Doctor chirped unamused as Olivia bowed her head with a sigh before
  standing tall again.'
- ! '"Maybe this wasn''t such a good idea after all."'
- ! '"And then there''s that silver rat thing," Val called after them, making them
  stop and turn back to her.'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"So it was a silver rat with a glowing red eye?"'
- ! '"Yes," Val replied.'
- ! '"Then it zizzed off.'
- ! '"I bet they do," the Doctor murmured as Olivia placed the dog on the table.'
- ! '"Well, what was it then?"'
- ! '"Answer me that."'
- ! '"Uh…Doctor, Craig''s in trouble," Olivia called, seeing him knock over a rack
  of bras with the security guard and another girl that worked in the store standing
  with him.'
- ! '"What''s all that hullabaloo?"'
- ! '"Um, that''ll be my partner," the Doctor replied, taking the net from Olivia
  to hand it to Val before grabbing Olivia''s hand to drag her toward Craig.'
- ! '"Hello, everyone!'
- Here to help!"
- ! '"Hello, Doctor," the worker and the security guard grinned.'
- ! '"Hi, Olivia."'
- ! '"Hi," she grinned back, before pointing between the two, asking, "Has anyone
  seen a silver rat?"'
- ! '"Long shot."'
- ! '"I see you''ve met my friend Craig," the Doctor smiled, introducing Craig.'
- ! '"Nice uniform, George," Olivia smiled at the guard, pinching the tip of his collar.'
- ! '"Thank you, Olivia," he smiled.'
- ! '"If he''s with you two, that''s alright, then."'
- ! '"Sorry!"'
- ! '"I thought he was hassling me, because that''s the last thing I need today, because
  Shona''s not turned up, right?'
- So I'm doing twice the work for the same money if you don't mind—"
- ! '"Shh," the Doctor whispered, silencing Kelly instantly.'
- ! '"God, I love you," Olivia sighed and he gave her a wink.'
- ! '"Please teach me how to do that," Craig begged.'
- ! '"No," the Doctor replied before turning to Kelly again and saying, "Hold on,
  un-shh.'
- Shona?"
- ! '"My supervisor," she replied.'
- ! '"She''s meant to be in today, but never showed up."'
- ! '"Where did you see her last?"'
- ! '"Last night," Kelly replied.'
- ! '"She was gonna check the dressing rooms before closing up."'
- ! '"How''d you do that?"'
- ! '"Do what?"'
- ! '"It''s a power, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"Some sort of weird, alien, hypnotic power.'
- I bet you excrete some sort of gas, makes people love you."
- ! '"I''m human, so how do you explain why they like me?"'
- ! '"You''re just…loveable," Craig blurted.'
- ! '"Aw!'
- thanks!"
- ! '"Ah!'
- I'd try that in red if I were you," the Doctor rushed through before moving on to
  the next room.
- ! '"I''m right though, aren''t I?"'
- ! '"Well, you love me," the Doctor told him.'
- ! '"I''ve never excreted any weird, alien gases at you."'
- ! '"I don''t love you," Craig retorted before looking to Olivia.'
- ! '"Or you, so don''t start that again."'
- ! '"Well, you didn''t excrete anything to get me to love you," Olivia chimed in
  then smirked, "That was after."'
- ! '"Olivia Felton!'
- Behave!"
- ! '"Yes, she''s loveable, and yes I know.'
- We're partners."
- ! '"Yeah, but I did exactly what you would''ve done, and I nearly got arrested!"'
- ! '"Stormy thinks you should believe in yourself more," the Doctor told him.'
- ! '"Great, so now my baby''s reviewing me," Craig muttered as the Doctor stepped
  toward one of the rooms.'
- ! '"Here," he called, making Craig step closer as Olivia remained with Afie, tickling
  his baby tummy and making him give his cute baby laugh.'
- ! '"Right here, last night, a Cyberman took Shona."'
- ! '"A Cyberman?"'
- ! '"I thought it was a little, silver rat."'
- ! '"It''s not a rat," the Doctor retorted, stepping out of the room again, tucking
  his Sonic away.'
- ! '"It''s a Cybermat."'
- ! '"Alright," Craig sighed.'
- ! '"Have a go at me just because I don''t know the names."'
- ! '"Oh, he won''t do that, will you Doctor?"'
- ! '"Of course not," he nodded, heading out of the dressing room.'
- ! '"Come on.'
- One of them's been sucking the electrical energy from this area."
- ! '"But why a shop?"'
- ! '"Why not a nuclear plant?"'
- ! '"Ok, why?"'
- ! '"Let''s ask it," the Doctor suggested.'
- ! '"We wait for the shop to shut, we stake the place out, we grab ourselves a Cybermat."'
- ! '"And this is just a coincidence, is it?"'
- ! '"What is?"'
- ! '"Aliens in Colchester.'
- Aliens, twice, in my life, happening to me just when you turn up."
- ! '"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not my fault, Craig."'
- ! '"Guys, you''re making the baby cry," Olivia cut in.'
- ! '"It''s his nappy," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"He''s mentioned it twice."'
- ! '"Yeah, well sorry.'
- I don't speak baby, do I?"
- ! '"There''s a changing station near electrical goods," Olivia told him and Craig
  turned to march Alfie away down the walkway.'
- ! '"Craig!'
- It's what the universe does for—"
- ! '"Theta," Olivia cut in with a breath, drawing his attention to her as she stared
  down one of the isles and he followed her gaze, freezing in his place.'
- ! '"…fun."'
- ! '"Doctor, look," she murmured, tugging on his arm and making him look up to the
  board as well, and he smiled, warmly at the sight of Amy''s super-imposed image
  next to a bottle of perfume called Petrichor, the tagline: For the Girl Who''s Tired
  of Waiting.'
- ! '"Amelia Pond," he smiled, proudly.'
- ! '"You could''ve said hello," Olivia murmured.'
- ! '"I''m sure they''d have been happy to see you."'
- ! '"And then what, Liv?"'
- ! '"I''ll tell them what''s happening, they''ll put themselves in danger following
  me again.'
- What if they don't survive this one?"
- ! '"I guess you have a point," she nodded, keeping her gaze on him, but he didn''t
  look at her.'
- ! '"But you miss them."'
- ! '"Of course I do.'
- That's good."
- ! '"That''s boring."'
- ! '"Shut up."'
- ! '"Right, let''s be having you, then, Cybermat," the Doctor muttered, still using
  his Sonic, and Alfie began crying in his stroller.'
- ! '"Shh!"'
- Craig pleaded with Alfie then asked the Doctor, "Can't you put that on quiet?"
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"It''s a Sonic Screwdriver!'
- Sonic equals sound!"
- ! '"Here, take this," Olivia offered, handing something to Craig.'
- ! '"I got it on discount.'
- It's a papoose…whatever that is."
- ! '"Why do I need a papoose?"'
- ! '"Alfie wants you attached to him," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"You are far too slow when he summons you."'
- ! '"When''s he going to stop giving me marks?"'
- ! '"Never!"'
- ! '"It''s parenthood.'
- Couldn't you have just got a babysitter?"
- ! '"No," the Doctor said to Alfie.'
- ! '"Any babysitter.'
- It doesn't have to be a hot one."
- ! '"Regular little lady''s man, aren''t ya?"'
- ! '"I told everyone I know I didn''t need their help this weekend," Craig reminded
  them.'
- ! '"They won''t even answer my calls.'
- Olivia, can you help me with this thing?"
- ! '"Hold onto him a sec while I help Craig?"'
- ! '"Why can''t we put him in the pram?"'
- ! '"He doesn''t wanna be in there any more," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"That''s why he was getting fussy.'
- He's wants to stretch out."
- ! '"Don''t tell me you speak Baby, too," Craig pleaded.'
- ! '"Not the way he does," she replied before stepping back toward the Doctor to
  take Alfie, ready to put him in the papoose.'
- ! '"It''s called Maternal Instincts."'
- ! '"Ha!"'
- ! '"Shh!"'
- ! '"That''s very odd," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"Must be on low power.'
- Or I'm better at that then I remember."
- ! '"Oh, is that it?"'
- ! '"Yeah," the Doctor smiled back.'
- ! '"Oh!'
- It's quite cute," Craig confessed.
- ! '"Look at that."'
- ! '"Metal rat, real mouth!"'
- ! '"Metal rat, real mouth!'
- Metal rat, real mouth!"
- ! '"Yes, I know it is," the Doctor retorted.'
- ! '"Stop screaming!"'
- ! '"Guys!'
- Shut up!"
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"Doctor, it''s George," she said, seeing the man lying on the ground ahead of
  her.'
- ! '"George," the Doctor called and stepped toward him to examine him but he was
  thrown back when something hit him in the face.'
- ! '"Theta!"'
- ! '"Theta, wake up!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"What happened?!"'
- ! '"Doctor, are you alright?"'
- ! '"I''ve been – I''ve been chipped – chapped – chopped," he explained, letting
  Craig and Olivia help him up.'
- ! '"The Cyberman…it killed George."'
- ! '"It dragged him away," Olivia explained what she saw to the Doctor as he leaned
  against a wall, feeling dizzy from the blow.'
- ! '"It must have taken him back to the ship."'
- ! '"The Cybermen are here?"'
- ! '"But you said—"'
- ! '"Yeah, I know what I said.'
- It should've taken them days to repair."
- ! '"Are you ok?"'
- ! '"Oh, I should be dead," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"But the arm it chopped me with…it was damaged.'
- Old spare parts."
- ! '"It must have changed the missing people," Olivia realized as the Doctor shook
  his head, trying to shake away his dizziness.'
- ! '"Changed the missing into Cybermen?"'
- ! '"Why didn''t they change you?"'
- ! '"Long story," the Doctor murmured.'
- ! '"I''m not exactly compatible."'
- ! '"It didn''t come after me either," Olivia explained.'
- ! '"I was sitting with you, and it only grabbed George to take it away."'
- ! '"Probably not able to carry two at a time, since it''s spare parts, and why are
  they using spare parts?"'
- ! '"Why?'
- Everything I find out makes less sense."
- ! '"Doctor, listen to me," Craig pleaded.'
- ! '"If the Cybermen are here, then we''re not safe.'
- We've gotta get back to base."
- ! '"We''ve got a base?"'
- ! '"When did we get a base?"'
- ! '"He means the house, Doctor," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"His house."'
- ! '"Oh, right…base," he muttered before grabbing Olivia''s hand and pulling her
  forward before stopping and stumbling back into her.'
- ! '"Doctor, take it slow, for once," she murmured.'
- ! '"You''re still rattled."'
- ! '"Help me out, sweet Liv," he whispered in her ear, and she nodded, letting him
  sling an arm around her neck to help him along as Craig led the way to his house.'
- ! '"I''m going down the shop," he announced.'
- ! '"We''ve run out of milk."'
- ! '"Doctor, you know what to do if he cries," Craig assumed as he headed toward
  the door and the Doctor stopped.'
- ! '"No," he admitted.'
- ! '"Me neither!"'
- ! '"I''ll take care of it," Olivia offered, starting to stand from her chair, but
  the Doctor stood before she could get to her feet.'
- ! '"No," he murmured as she stared up at him with a frown.'
- ! '"I''ll get him.'
- You finish up here."
- ! '"But, I don''t know what it is you''re doing," she chuckled, watching him head
  toward the stairs.'
- ! '"Hello, Stormageddon," he greeted, making Alfie start to calm, but he still fussed.'
- ! '"It''s the Doctor.'
- Here to help."
- ! '"Hey, there, there," the Doctor whispered as Alfie still fussed and Olivia leaned
  on the doorframe to watch him wave the bunny at him.'
- ! '"Be quiet.'
- Save the tears for later, boyo."
- Olivia frowned when he groaned and rubbed his face before he muttered, "No, that
  was crabby.
- I am so old, so near the end."
- ! '"But you, Alfie Owens, you are so young.'
- Aren't you?"
- ! '"And, you know, right now, everything''s ahead of you.'
- You could be anything."
- ! '"Yes," the Doctor crooned to Alfie, seeing him rub his eyes.'
- ! '"I know.'
- You could walk among the stars."
- ! '"They don''t actually look like that, you know.'
- They are rather more impressive."
- ! '"Yeah," he grinned at Alfie as the baby cooed and looked around the room.'
- ! '"You know, when I was little, like you, I dreamt of the stars.'
- Find someone who makes you feel…invincible."
- ! '"Liv, you alright?"'
- ! '"Stormy''s worried about you too.'
- Have you been crying?"
- ! '"Only a little," she admitted, letting Alfie grab onto her finger and avoiding
  eye contact with the Doctor.'
- ! '"I have a lot on my mind."'
- ! '"Put a blanket on him," she suggested, stepping toward the crib to pull the blanket
  from it and wrap it around Alfie.'
- ! '"If he''s warm he''ll fall asleep easier."'
- ! '"Look at you," he smiled, letting her wrap Alfie as he still held him.'
- ! '"So maternal.'
- How do you know so much about babies?"
- ! '"I watch TV and read," she smiled back, rubbing Alfie''s back.'
- ! '"If it was my own I''m sure I''d panic and forget everything, though."'
- ! '"Stormy doesn''t think so," the Doctor reported.'
- ! '"He thinks you''ll be an excellent mum."'
- Olivia swallowed the lump in her throat before smiling, "Thank you, Alfie.
- Coolest dad in the universe."
- ! '"Don''t know about that," he smiled, sadly, and Olivia knew why before he added,
  "Your dad''s trying his best, you know, Alfie."'
- ! '"Yes, I know," he grumbled.'
- ! '"It''s not his fault he doesn''t have mammary glands."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Neither do I."'
- ! '"Yes," he drawled in response to Alfie.'
- ! '"Hers are…rather nice."'
- ! '"Only rather nice?"'
- ! '"Alright, yes, they''re…perfect," he muttered, making Olivia''s smirk grow to
  a smile before she frowned in wonder when she heard some kind of beeping from the
  door.'
- ! '"Alfie, why is there a sinister beeping coming from behind me?"'
- ! '"Theta…" Olivia called in warning as they both turned and looked to the sparking
  Cybermat gnashing its teeth in the doorway.'
- ! '"Oh, no you don''t," the Doctor snarled before lifting his Sonic and zapping
  the Cybermat.'
- ! '"Come on, you two, run!'
- It's only stunned."
- ! '"We''re going to go outside," he told them.'
- ! '"Don''t worry about it."'
- ! '"Theta, it''s coming!"'
- ! '"I can''t lock it!"'
- ! '"I''ve got it," Olivia assured him, pulling her Sonic out and using it to lock
  the door.'
- ! '"Where''s the phone!'
- Tell him not to go in the house!"
- ! '"He''s not answering," Olivia replied, urgently.'
- ! '"It''s gone to voicemail."'
- ! '"Leave a message then."'
- ! '"Leave a message?!"'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"No, no, no, no, no!"'
- ! '"Take the baby."'
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Oh, you''re an idiot."'
- ! '"Where''s Alfie?!"'
- ! '"Olivia''s got him!"'
- ! '"I just have to find the right frequency, shut it down again."'
- ! '"Hit it!"'
- ! '"Hold it down," the Doctor ordered, adjusting his Sonic as he stood.'
- ! '"Get on with it!"'
- ! '"Oh, it must be shielded from metastatic energy.'
- Of course!"
- ! '"Yeah.'
- Of course!"
- ! '"Don''t worry, I have an app for that."'
- ! '"Stand back!'
- Stand back!"
- ! '"Success," the Doctor panted as Olivia sighed in relief, stepping into the house
  again, carefully.'
- ! '"That was amazing.'
- That thing should've had you, easily."
- ! '"Is it definitely dead?"'
- ! '"Inactive, yes," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Technically, never been alive.'
- Bravo, eh?"
- ! '"Alfie!"'
- ! '"Ow!'
- What—?!"
- ! '"Stupid, idiot!'
- What's the matter with you?!"
- ! '"I was helping Craig!'
- Did you want him to get eaten?!"
- ! '"I had my Sonic.'
- If I'd done that you never would've let me hear the end of it!"
- ! '"Olivia, stop!"'
- ! '"Stop it.'
- I've done crazier things than that and you never got this angry."
- ! '"What''s the matter with her, then?"'
- ! '"I wish I knew," the Doctor admitted.'
- ! '"I''m sorry I hit you," she muttered when he stepped next to her, but she still
  didn''t look at him.'
- ! '"And yelled at you…and called you an idiot."'
- ! '"You always call me an idiot, Liv," he smirked, placing his hand over the one
  she used to fiddle with the dial on the console.'
- ! '"You yell at me, too…and hit me.'
- It usually means you're frightened."
- ! '"I am," she admitted, shifting her hand to grasp the tips of his fingers, her
  gaze on them as she stroked her thumb over his nails.'
- ! '"I''m afraid of what''s coming.'
- I'll end up one of those crazy old cat ladies!"
- ! '"Cat ladies?"'
- ! '"Yes!'
- And they'll all be named after different alien species, and my favorite will be
  named Doctor!"
- ! '"It''s not funny, Theta!"'
- ! '"It is a little," he confessed.'
- ! '"But only a little, tiny bit."'
- ! '"There''s my girl," he grinned, wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling
  her close.'
- ! '"My Sweet Liv.'
- I promise, even after I'm gone, I'll take care of you."
- ! '"How?"'
- ! '"Well, you''ll have the TARDIS," he began, wrapping his other arm around her
  waist to pull her even closer.'
- ! '"Your mum will take care of you.'
- You can even call the Ponds to talk, and River, too."
- ! '"Theta…they''re not you," she replied, her hands over each of his hearts.'
- ! '"They may make it easier to handle your…death, but it won''t fill the hole in
  my heart after you''re gone."'
- ! '"I know, darling, but it''s a start," he murmured, lifting a hand to stroke her
  cheek with the backs of his fingers.'
- ! '"I''m scared, too.'
- It's fixed."
- ! '"I know," she sighed, lowering her hands to slip them around his chest and lay
  her cheek in the center of it, his chin resting on top of her head.'
- ! '"I wasn''t there.'
- She wasn't there."
- ! '"Yeah," he sighed.'
- ! '"I''m guessing you left me with my mom?"'
- ! '"Most likely."'
- ! '"Or…maybe with Aaron?"'
- ! '"I can do that when it''s time.'
- If that's what you want."
- ! '"Thank you, my love."'
- ! '"You''re welcome, darling."'
- ! '"We''d better get back before Craig thinks we''ve left him," she smiled, sadly.'
- ! '"Are you sure?"'
- ! '"Are you alright?'
- We can stay here a while longer."
- ! '"No, we have to get this sorted," she objected, shaking her head.'
- ! '"Cybermen are not a species to put off.'
- That's how they grow."
- ! '"Alright," he sighed, and she tried heading toward the door but he kept hold
  of her by the waist, making her frown up at him, but her frown fell away when she
  saw the mischievous smirk he wore.'
- ! '"Head out in thirty?"'
- ! '"Thirty?"'
- ! '"Minutes," he elaborated, making her jaw nearly drop as she stared at him.'
- ! '"Mr.'
- Sigma, I think you're trying to seduce me."
- ! '"Not trying, Mrs.'
- Sigma…I am seducing you."
- ! '"Fifty minutes," she negotiated.'
- ! '"Remember what we talked about.'
- I want grade A fireworks."
- ! '"Forty."'
- ! '"Forty-five."'
- The Doctor hummed in thought as she only smirked up at him before he replied, "Deal.
- Need to let Craig know we're not leaving."
- ! '"Hurry up, Theta, or I''ll start without you," she called, casually as she sauntered
  toward the stairs.'
- ! '"Oi!'
- Behave!"
- ! '"I''m knackered," Craig announced then asked, "Where''s Olivia?"'
- ! '"She''s in the TARDIS," the Doctor replied, not looking at him as he cautiously
  added, "Having a nap.'
- She was very tired after today."
- ! '"Hope she''s alright," Craig replied, then looked to the Cybermat and asked,
  "That thing was eating up the electricity?"'
- ! '"Transmitting it up to the Cybership," the Doctor confirmed.'
- ! '"But why?'
- And why do they need power, why are those conversions not complete yet, and what
  are they doing up there?"
- ! '"You said you were gonna look at its brain," Craig recalled.'
- ! '"Well, I had to wipe its brain," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Now I can reprogram it, use it as a weapon against them."'
- ! '"The Cybermat came after us?"'
- ! '"No, after me."'
- ! '"They sent it after us."'
- ! '"After me.'
- Because of me, you and Alfie nearly died."
- ! '"And Olivia."'
- ! '"Olivia''s used to it."'
- ! '"How can she be used to it?"'
- ! '"She just is!"'
- He pulled the monocle out of his eye and asked, "Do you still feel safe with me,
  Craig?"
- ! '"You can''t help who your mates are," Craig chuckled.'
- ! '"No," the Doctor replied before muttering, "Liv''s right.'
- I should never have come here."
- ! '"What would''ve happened if you hadn''t come?"'
- ! '"Who else knows about Cybermen and teleports?"'
- ! '"But I put people in danger," the Doctor insisted.'
- ! '"Stop beating yourself up!"'
- ! '"If it weren''t for you, this whole planet would be in absolute ruin."'
- The Doctor sat forward and set his things on the table before replying, "Well, Craig,
  very soon, I won't be here.
- Tomorrow is the day I…"
- ! '"Liv, you should be asleep," he scolded, gently as he stepped toward her.'
- ! '"You need rest.'
- You have to help me tomorrow morning with my plan."
- ! '"I know," she nodded in shaky voice.'
- ! '"I just…I woke up and you weren''t next to me and it scared me.'
- Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming."
- ! '"Not a dream, darling," he smiled, brushing one of her tears away from her cheek
  as she smiled up at him.'
- ! '"Come on.'
- How does that sound?"
- ! '"Like heaven," Olivia sighed through a smile as the Doctor wrapped an arm around
  her shoulders and pulled her toward the door.'
- ! '"He''s gonna follow us," Olivia warned the Doctor as they stepped out the front
  door, handing him the Cybermat.'
- ! '"No, he won''t," he assured her, the Cybermat beeping in his hand.'
- ! '"Wanna bet?"'
- ! '"Safe mode.'
- Clever me."
- ! '"You really think he''s just gonna read that note and not follow us?"'
- ! '"Probably not, but I can dream.'
- Come along, Bitey."
- ! '"You did not name the Cybermat."'
- ! '"Of course I did.'
- Why wouldn't I?"
- ! '"We''re not keeping it."'
- ! '"Why not?!'
- Might be nice having a Cybermat around, detecting Cyber-things and protecting us
  from…Cyber-ness."
- ! '"Idiot."'
- ! '"You love me."'
- ! '"Yeah, yeah."'
- ! '"Morning," Val called as she headed toward them, the Doctor still in thought.'
- ! '"Morning," Olivia grinned to her.'
- ! '"Teleport''s still fused," the Doctor reported, starting to walk with Val.'
- ! '"They didn''t repair it.'
- So the Cyberman last night – How did it get down here, how did it get out, and why,
  why am I asking you?"
- ! '"You found the silver rat?"'
- ! '"But where are the silver men?"'
- ! '"Come on, Liv."'
- ! '"Brainstorming, Liv.'
- Throw me a theory."
- ! '"Secondary teleport?"'
- ! '"No, there is no other teleport.'
- Something complicated, something powerful, something shielded."
- ! '"Like a door?"'
- ! '"A door," the Doctor agreed in realization as they stopped next to the fitting
  room Shona had gone missing from and he looked to the mirror, stepping into the
  room.'
- ! '"A dascylium-bounded steel door disguised as a wall."'
- ! '"Cheaters," Olivia breathed, looking into the darkness behind the mirror.'
- ! '"So, it didn''t teleport down," he murmured.'
- ! '"It climbed up.'
- Liv, stay here."
- ! '"Um, I don''t think so," she retorted.'
- ! '"Don''t start."'
- ! '"Oh, I''m starting."'
- ! '"Olivia," he said, firmly, making her look to him in surprised wonder.'
- ! '"I''m a Time Lord, I''m not compatible to their assimilation, but you are.'
- Now, for once…just once, stay here."
- ! '"Kiss for luck?"'
- ! '"Be careful, Theta," she whispered and he nodded before stepping through the
  doorway and into the tunnel.'
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Where'd he go?"
- ! '"He went in there," Olivia reported, pointing to the hole in the wall and Craig
  began looking around the rooms for something.'
- ! '"We can''t follow him!'
- If they get us they'll convert us."
- ! '"But you can''t just leave him alone!"'
- ! '"Can you use your silver wand thing on this to make it a weapon, or something?"'
- ! '"That''s not how it works," she argued as Craig stepped around her toward the
  door anyway.'
- ! '"What are you doing?!'
- And where's Alfie?!"
- ! '"He''s with that lady…Val," he replied.'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"So that''s what happened," Olivia whispered as and they hurried toward it, knowing
  the Doctor was inside.'
- ! '"It was down here and the shop was built on top.'
- The power attracted them."
- ! '"He must be the new leader," one of the Cybermen reported.'
- ! '"No, he is not like us," the other Cyberman replied.'
- ! '"Brain and binary vascular system incompatible.'
- Other body parts may be of use."
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Oi!'
- Cybermen!"
- ! '"You get off my planet, or I…activate this!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Well, what was I supposed to do?!'
- Tackle him?!"
- ! '"Craig, stop this!"'
- ! '"Get out!'
- Both of you!"
- ! '"It''s like you said, Doctor," Craig argued.'
- ! '"You gotta believe you can do it."'
- ! '"You located us," the Cyberman observed.'
- ! '"Yeah, the teleport in the lift – bit rubbish – and that little Cybermat never
  stood a chance.'
- You see what you're dealing with?!"
- ! '"Craig!'
- Shut up!"
- ! '"You are compatible," the Cyberman noticed.'
- ! '"You are intelligent."'
- ! '"Let them go!"'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"I''m not intelligent!'
- You don't want me!"
- ! '"Do not fear," the Cyberman replied as Craig was shoved into the converting machine.'
- ! '"We will take your fear from you.'
- We will conquer this world."
- ! '"No!'
- I'm more intelligent then he is!"
- ! '"I''ll be Cybercontroller!'
- I volunteer!"
- ! '"No!'
- Olivia, shut up!"
- ! '"Doctor!'
- Olivia!"
- ! '"Do something!"'
- ! '"Craig, don''t worry.'
- It'll drain their power."
- ! '"You have failed, Doctor," the Cyberman shot out.'
- ! '"Put the female into the secondary conversion machine."'
- ! '"No!"'
- ! '"Leave her alone!"'
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Liv!'
- No!"
- ! '"Doctor!"'
- ! '"Your designation will be Cybercommander," the Cyberman reported to Olivia.'
- ! '"Begin conversion Phase 1.'
- Cleanse the brain of emotions."
- ! '"Fight it!"'
- ! '"They can''t convert you if you fight back.'
- Don't give in to it!"
- ! '"Help me!"'
- ! '"Craig, think of Sophie!"'
- ! '"Think of Alfie!'
- Don't let them take it all away."
- ! '"Doctor, I can''t!"'
- ! '"Make it stop!"'
- ! '"Please make it stop!"'
- ! '"Listen to me, I believe in you," the Doctor urged.'
- ! '"I believe you could do this.'
- Tomorrow I'm going to die, but I don't mind, if you just prove me right!"
- ! '"Craig!'
- Olivia!"
- ! '"Begin full conversion," the Cyberman ordered as the helmets sealed over their
  heads and the whirring of machinery began as the Doctor rubbed a finger over his
  wedding band.'
- ! '"Olivia, can you hear me?!'
- Please, answer me."
- ! '"Unknown soundwave detected," one of the Cybermen reported.'
- ! '"Theta," Olivia responded, but it was weak, making his hearts race in more panic.'
- ! '"I can''t breathe."'
- ! '"It is the sound of fear," another Cyberman replied of the noise.'
- ! '"It is irrelevant.'
- We will remove all fear."
- ! '"Alfie, I''m so sorry!"'
- ! '"Alfie please, stop.'
- I-I can't help him."
- ! '"I can hear him," Olivia told him, making him look to her unmoving body in the
  machine.'
- ! '"I can hear you both."'
- ! '"Emotions eradicated," the Cyberman announced.'
- ! '"Conversion complete."'
- ! '"Alert!"'
- ! '"Emotional subsystems rebooting!'
- This is impossible!"
- ! '"He can hear him," the Doctor breathed aloud, watching Craig start to move.'
- ! '"He can hear Alfie.'
- You are never gonna get a better one than this!"
- ! '"What is happening?!"'
- ! '"What''s happening, you metal moron," the Doctor shot back, struggling to be
  free as he saw the seal on Craig''s helmet separate.'
- ! '"A baby is crying and you better watch out, because guess what…daddy''s coming
  home!"'
- ! '"Alright, Liv!'
- I'm here!"
- ! '"Emergency!"'
- ! '"Emotional influx!"'
- ! '"What''s happening?!"'
- ! '"You''ve triggered a feedback loop into their emotional inhibitors," the Doctor
  explained, still working on the helmet.'
- ! '"All that stuff they cut out of themselves – now they''re feeling it…"'
- ! '"And now…there''s going to be a very big explosion!"'
- ! '"This way!"'
- ! '"Overload!"'
- ! '"The teleport!"'
- ! '"How did you get in there?!"'
- ! '"Liv, come on, open your eyes," he urged, lightly tapping his fingers to her
  face.'
- ! '"Come on, don''t make me slap you.'
- Wake up."
- ! '"If you''re expecting the kiss of life, you should hold your breath," he smirked,
  and one of her eyes popped open to peek at him with a grin before the other opened
  as well.'
- ! '"Actually, I was going for a Sleeping Beauty/Snow White scenario," she smirked
  back, making him chuckle before standing to help her up.'
- He pulled her up by the hands, but when she stood too fast, she stumbled, holding
  her head as she winced and explained, "Head rush."
- ! '"Stay on my arm, you''ll be fine," he smiled, looping one arm around his and
  she gripped him with the other as they headed toward Craig, Alfie and Val.'
- Hearing Alfie giggle, the Doctor grinned, "That was another review.
- Ten out of ten!"
- ! '"Olivia, you alight?"'
- ! '"The Cybermen…they blew up.'
- I blew them up with love."
- ! '"No, that''s impossible," the Doctor smiled.'
- ! '"And also grossly sentimental and oversimplistic.'
- Why are you jabbing me in the ribs?!"
- ! '"Because he blew them up with love.'
- Shut up," she retorted, making Val and Craig grin up at him and he couldn't help
  but chuckle as he nodded along.
- ! '"You are an absolute mess," Val told Craig and Olivia.'
- ! '"Yes, Liv, Craig, go clean yourselves up, eh?"'
- ! '"Craig, go first," Olivia smiled, taking Alfie from him.'
- ! '"I''ll watch Alfie."'
- ! '"Good, thanks," he smiled back, kissing Alfie''s head before murmuring, "Be right
  back, Alfie."'
- Olivia watched him head off to find some clothes to change into before looking to
  the Doctor to ask, "What about the building?
- Is it safe here?"
- ! '"The building should be totally safe, structurally, and, of course, the bonded
  dascylium contained the explosion," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Oh, of course," Olivia nodded along before Alfie made a baby noise, making Olivia
  smile at him.'
- ! '"What did he say this time, huh?"'
- ! '"He''s being naughty again," the Doctor muttered.'
- ! '"Stop it, Stormy, she''s old enough to be your…well your mother.'
- Stop squeezing them!"
- ! '"Here," Olivia laughed, handing Alfie over to the Doctor.'
- ! '"Take him.'
- I'm going shopping."
- ! '"Don''t be long, Olivia!"'
- ! '"You took your time finding something to wear," the Doctor smiled, stepping up
  behind Olivia as she stood at the console and he wrapped his arms around her.'
- ! '"Worth the wait.'
- You look wonderful."
- ! '"It''s just jeans and a button down, Theta," she murmured, not looking away from
  the console, making him frown at her in confusion.'
- ! '"It''s nothing special."'
- ! '"Everything you wear is special, Liv," he argued, gently.'
- ! '"What''s the matter with you?'
- It makes me nervous when you're quiet."
- ! '"I''m just tired," she sighed, turning in his arms to rest her head on his chest,
  her arms wrapping around him.'
- ! '"I think the running is finally getting to me.'
- I'm getting old."
- ! '"You are not getting old, Olivia Felton," he smirked, hugging her closer.'
- ! '"And I''m sensing that''s not what it is at all.'
- You'll tell me when you're ready to, yes?"
- ! '"Come on, let''s say goodbye to Craig, eh?"'
- ! '"See?"'
- ! '"I do come back."'
- ! '"How did you…?"'
- ! '"Time machine," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Even with time travel, getting glazers on a Sunday…tricky."'
- ! '"You went back in time?"'
- ! '"That means you used up your hours.'
- What about Exodor?"
- ! '"We couldn''t let you get in trouble with Sophie when she gets back," Olivia
  explained, genuinely as the Doctor wrapped an arm around her shoulders.'
- ! '"You used up your time for me?"'
- ! '"Of course I did.'
- And he's very proud of his dad."
- ! '"He calls me dad?"'
- ! '"Yes, of course he does, now," the Doctor replied, and Alfie made another little
  noise.'
- ! '"Yeah, I know.'
- He's a bit thick, isn't he?"
- ! '"Oi!'
- Shut up, you two!"
- ! '"Well, now it''s time," he announced.'
- ! '"We have to go."'
- ! '"Doctor, I know that something''s wrong," Craig confessed.'
- ! '"I can help you."'
- ! '"Nobody can help me," the Doctor argued as Olivia blinked to try to keep her
  tears at bay then looked to the fridge where some blue stationary caught her eye.'
- ! '"Um, Craig, can I use that stationary?"'
- ! '"Just a few.'
- Would Sophie mind?"
- ! '"No, of course," he nodded with a small smile.'
- ! '"We can get more.'
- Where are you gonna go?"
- ! '"America!"'
- ! '"Sophie will be home any second," Craig tried.'
- ! '"Are you sure—?"'
- ! '"I can''t miss this appointment, Craig," the Doctor insisted.'
- ! '"Goodbye, mate."'
- ! '"Wait there," Craig ordered.'
- ! '"One second."'
- ! '"Any monsters?"'
- ! '"From Sean''s stag," Craig explained, placing the hat on the Doctor''s head and
  the Time Lord adjusted it to sit perfectly, still grinning.'
- ! '"Wow!"'
- ! '"You ride ''em, partner."'
- ! '"Oh, thanks!'
- Liv, how do I look?"
- ! '"Lookin'' handsome, cowboy," she nodded with a sniffle.'
- ! '"Liv—?"'
- ! '"I''m sorry guys, I''m…tired," she lied, turning to Craig and hugging him then
  leaving a kiss to Alfie''s head before stepping back.'
- ! '"I''m just gonna wait in the TARDIS.'
- Thanks for the stationary."
- ! '"You better sort her out," Craig advised and the Doctor nodded in agreement before
  snapping his fingers, pointing to Craig in farewell and turning to head for the
  door as well.'
- ! '"Bye."'
- ! '"Liv!"'
- ! '"Liv, darling, what''s wrong?'
- What have I done?"
- ! '"Nothing," she shook her head, restraining a sob.'
- ! '"It''s stupid…unimportant."'
- ! '"Olivia, everything to do with you is important to me," he argued, gently, trying
  to catch her gaze as she averted it.'
- ! '"Tell me."'
- ! '"It''s the hat."'
- ! '"You don''t like it?'
- I think it's cool."
- ! '"No, I like it…that''s the problem."'
- He frowned in confusion before admitting, "Not following you, darling."
- She sniffled again before replying, "You were wearing that hat in Utah.
- I was the first one to meet you and…the first thing I thought was that you looked
  so handsome."
- ! '"I''ll leave you home, Liv," he murmured.'
- ! '"I won''t make you watch it again.'
- You've been a mess lately, and it's my fault."
- ! '"I''m the one that said I would travel with you," she shuddered.'
- ! '"I''m the one who fell in love with you and married you.'
- I'm just as much to blame as you are."
- ! '"It seems we''re both mad people then," he smiled as she finally stepped back,
  calming her sobs and he lifted his hands to her face to pull her close and kiss
  away the tears streaming down her cheeks.'
- ! '"Come on, let''s get to the TARDIS."'
- ! '"Well, then, old girl," he murmured.'
- ! '"One last trip, eh?"'
- ! '"Hey," he smiled.'
- ! '"I''m the Doctor.'
- And you are very, very welcome."
- ! '"Theta?"'
- ! '"What''s wrong?"'
- ! '"What''s wrong, Olivia Felton, is that I don''t want to die," he explained, still
  running around the console as she only stood next to it, watching him.'
- ! '"I don''t want to die and obviously someone wants me dead.'
- Why does the Silence want me dead and why are they making me leave one of the most
  precious things in my life to mourn me for the rest of her days?!"
- ! '"I can''t hurt you like that, Liv," he said, stepping toward her.'
- ! '"Not again.'
- If we knew why, then maybe…maybe it wouldn't hurt so much and…you wouldn't be so
  sad after I die."
- Olivia felt tears well in her eyes anew as he stopped in front of her then shuddered,
  "You idiot.
- And maybe that's selfish, but it's true."
- ! '"I have to know," he whispered in her ear.'
- ! '"You don''t have to come, but I have to know why."'
- ! '"I''ll come," she shuddered, hugging him tightly.'
- ! '"I want every moment I can have with you…till the very last second."'
- ! '"That''s my girl.'
- Never let me go."
- ! '"Never."'
- ! '"Miss me?"'
- ! '"Is that a Dalek eyestalk?"'
- ! '"Yes, it is," he confirmed, sticking his Sonic, headfirst into a slot on the
  console then lifting off.'
- ! '"Why do you have it?"'
- ! '"I might need it," he replied, pulling the scanner toward him to look at it.'
- ! '"Alright, we need to head to the Docks of Calisto B, that''s where he was last
  seen."'
- ! '"Who?"'
- ! '"Someone important.'
- Coming this time?"
- ! '"As long as there aren''t any Daleks."'
- ! '"Dalek free, I promise."'
- ! '"Right, stay close, Liv."'
- ! '"Gideon Vandaleur," the Doctor demanded.'
- ! '"Get him.'
- Now."
- ! '"Who says he''s here?"'
- ! '"I am so hot for you right now," she whispered, sending his wide-eyed gaze at
  her as she only smiled, seductively.'
- ! '"Olivia, I''m working.'
- Behave," he scolded, gently, but she could feel his grip on her waist tighten, making
  her grin in satisfaction.
- ! '"Follow me," the red-skinned man ordered, stepping out of his chain-link box
  to lead them to a huge room for their meeting, bringing a bottle and three glasses
  with him.'
- ! '"What''s this?"'
- ! '"Hyper-vodka," he replied, watching her start to lift the bottle to serve some
  and warned, "I wouldn''t."'
- ! '"Why not?"'
- ! '"Bad things will happen that you won''t remember later," he replied, smirking
  as she set the bottle down then sensed movement next to him and looked to the cloaked
  figure joining them.'
- ! '"Father Gideon Vandaleur.'
- Former envoy of the Silence."
- ! '"My condolences," the Doctor whispered, making both Olivia and Gideon frown at
  him in wonder.'
- ! '"Your what?"'
- ! '"Gideon Vandaleur has been dead for six months," the Doctor reported, pulling
  out his Sonic and aiming it at him.'
- ! '"Can I speak to the captain, please?"'
- ! '"Oh, I see," Olivia nodded with a smile.'
- ! '"The Teselecta."'
- ! '"Time-traveling, shape-changing robot powered by miniaturized people," the Doctor
  grinned, lowering his Sonic.'
- ! '"Never get bored of that."'
- ! '"Been a while since Berlin," Olivia smiled at the Gideon-bot.'
- ! '"Doctor, what have you done to our systems?"'
- ! '"Oh, they''ll be fine, if you behave," the Doctor assured him, and Olivia could
  only imagine what was happening inside.'
- ! '"Now, this unit can disguise itself as anyone in the universe.'
- Tell me about them."
- ! '"Tell you what?"'
- ! '"One thing, just one: their weakest link."'
- ! '"That one in the hat is good," someone next to her said, but she didn''t take
  her eyes off the two.'
- ! '"Yes, he is," she replied, not caring if she got a response.'
- ! '"You know him?"'
- ! '"He''s my husband," she answered, then smiled when the Doctor sat forward enough
  to tip over his king, conceding the game.'
- ! '"Why did he concede?!"'
- ! '"He could''ve won!"'
- ! '"Because he got exactly what he wanted," she grinned, turning to push her way
  back through the crowd and meet him outside the arena.'
- ! '"This is where the Headless Monks keep the leftovers," Gantok explained.'
- ! '"Watch your step.'
- There are traps everywhere."
- ! '"Seriously, with the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme?"'
- ! '"We''ve done this before on Amazonia, Doctor.'
- I didn't like it so much."
- ! '"I hate rats," the Doctor ground out.'
- ! '"There are no rats in the Transept," Gantok assured him.'
- ! '"Oh, good."'
- ! '"The skulls eat them."'
- ! '"Oh, yeah," Olivia blurted.'
- ! '"That''s not creepy at all.'
- You can be a real lousy date, sometimes, you know that, Doctor?"
- ! '"The Headless Monks behead you alive, remember?"'
- ! '"Why are some of them in boxes?"'
- ! '"Because some people are rich and some people are left to rot," Gantok explained.'
- ! '"And Dorium Maldovar was always very rich."'
- ! '"Thank you for bringing us, Gantok," the Doctor said, still looking at Dorium.'
- ! '"My pleasure," Gantok replied before reaching out and grabbing Olivia by the
  hair to drag her back toward him.'
- ! '"It saves me the trouble of burying you.'
- Nobody beats me at chess."
- ! '"Olivia!"'
- ! '"Grab hold of my hands, Liv.'
- Climb up!"
- ! '"Are you alright, darling?"'
- ! '"Hello?'
- Is someone there?"
- The Doctor took Olivia's hand and pulled her into view, making Dorium smile before
  he sighed, "Oh, Doctor!
- The Monks, they turned on me."
- ! '"Well…I''m afraid they rather did, a bit," the Doctor replied, warily.'
- ! '"Give it to me straight, Doctor," Dorium pleaded, making Olivia stare at him
  with wide eyes at what she assumed he''d ask next.'
- ! '"How bad are my injuries?"'
- ! '"Uh…" Olivia hummed, unsure of what to say, or what the Doctor would say.'
- ! '"Well…" the Doctor trailed off but Dorium instantly burst out laughing.'
- ! '"Oh, your face!"'
- Dorium laughed, heartily as the Doctor began pacing, before calming himself to assure
  them, "Oh, it's not so bad, really, as long as they get your box the right way up.
- I got a media chip fitted in my head years ago and the WiFi down here is excellent,
  so I keep myself entertained."
- ! '"I need to know about the Silence," the Doctor cut to the chase.'
- ! '"Oh," Dorium grumbled before explaining, "They''re a religious order of great
  power and discretion.'
- The Sentinels of History, as they like to call themselves."
- ! '"And they want me dead?"'
- ! '"No, not really.'
- They just don't want you to remain alive."
- ! '"That''s ok, then.'
- I was a bit worried for a minute, there."
- ! '"You''re a man with a long and dangerous past, but your future is infinitely
  more terrifying.'
- The Silence will believe it must be averted."
- ! '"It occurs to me that you could''ve told us all of this the last time we met
  with you," Olivia cut in, irritably.'
- ! '"It was a busy day and I got beheaded!"'
- ! '"What''s so dangerous about my future?"'
- ! '"On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature
  can speak falsely or fail to answer, a question will be asked, a question that must
  never, ever be answered."'
- ! '"''Silence will fall when the question is asked''," Olivia murmured in recollection.'
- ! '"''Silence must fall'' would be a better translation," Dorium replied.'
- ! '"The Silence are determined that the question will never be answered, that the
  Doctor will never reach Trenzalore."'
- ! '"I don''t understand.'
- What's it got to do with me?"
- ! '"The first question," Dorium explained.'
- ! '"The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.'
- Would you like to know what it is?"
- ! '"Yes."'
- ! '"Are you sure?"'
- ! '"Very, very sure?"'
- ! '"Of course," the Doctor replied, swallowing hard as he took Olivia''s hand in
  his to pull her closer.'
- ! '"Then I shall tell you.'
- But on your own head be it."
- ! '"Liv, TARDIS, now."'
- ! '"But—"'
- ! '"Go."'
- ! '"It''s too frightening, put me back!"'
- ! '"What are you doing?!"'
- ! '"Ow!"'
- ! '"I''ve fallen on my nose!"'
- ! '"Doctor, what is going on?"'
- ! '"Have you got WiFi here?"'
- ! '"I''m bored already, and my nose is hurting.'
- You do see that you have to die?"
- ! '"What''s the question?"'
- ! '"Doctor?"'
- ! '"Doctor, please, open my hatch," Dorium complained, making Olivia growl in irritation,
  glaring at the box.'
- ! '"I''ve got an awful headache.'
- Which, to be honest, means more than it used to."
- ! '"Olivia, open the bloody door!"'
- ! '"It''s like some terrible weight pressing down on my – Oh, I see."'
- ! '"Why Lake Silencio?"'
- ! '"Why…Utah?"'
- ! '"It''s a still point in time," Dorium explained.'
- ! '"Easier to create a fixed point," Olivia murmured in realization.'
- ! '"And your death is a fixed point, Doctor.'
- You can't run away from this."
- ! '"I''ve been running all my life.'
- Why should I stop?"
- ! '"Because now you know what''s at stake, why your life must end."'
- ! '"Not today," he chirped, grabbing the phone and handing it to Olivia, rattling
  off a number which she quickly dialed into the phone then pressed to her ear.'
- ! '"What''s the point in delaying?'
- How long have you delayed already?"
- ! '"Been knocking about.'
- I can invent a new color, save the dodo, join the Beatles."
- ! '"Yeah, hang on," Olivia spoke into the receiver before handing it to him and
  he grabbed it from her, pressing it to his ear.'
- ! '"Hello!'
- Tell him we're going out and it's all on me, except for the money and the driving,"
  he nearly shouted before handing the phone back to Olivia and turning to Dorium.
- ! '"I have got a time machine, Dorium.'
- I could—!"
- ! '"I could still make Liv a mother."'
- ! '"Time catches up with us all, Doctor," Dorium argued, catching his attention.'
- ! '"Well, it has never laid a glove on me!"'
- ! '"Doctor," Olivia called in a small voice, making him look to her as she held
  the phone toward him.'
- ! '"They want to speak with you."'
- ! '"Hello," he smiled into the phone.'
- ! '"Doctor, I''m so sorry," the nurse on the other end said, Olivia barely able
  to hear it from her position.'
- ! '"We didn''t know how to contact you.'
- I'm afraid Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart passed away a few months ago."
- ! '"Doctor, what''s wrong?"'
- ! '"Nothing," he replied, hanging up the phone.'
- ! '"I…just…"'
- ! '"It''s time," he murmured, making her give a sob, but he only held her close
  as he whispered, "It''s time."'
- ! '"Surely, the Doctor could deliver the messages himself," the Gideon-bot guessed.'
- ! '"It would involve crossing his own timestream," Olivia replied.'
- ! '"And I''d be crossing my own as well.'
- Unless you want the universe imploding, you'll deliver them."
- ! '"According to our files, this is the end for him.'
- His final journey."
- ! '"What do the files say about me in there, huh?"'
- ! '"We''ll deliver his messages," Gideon-bot assured her, side-stepping the question.'
- ! '"You may both depend on us."'
- ! '"Thank you," she nodded before turning to head toward the door.'
- ! '"Ms.'
- Felton," Gideon-bot called, stopping her just as she opened it and she looked to
  it with a frown.
- ! '"Whatever you or the Doctor thinks of the Teselecta, we are champions of law
  and order, just as he has always been.'
- Is there nothing else we can do?"
- ! '"You know what, there is one thing…"'
- ! '"Napoleon gave me this bottle," the Doctor reported, pouring wine into each of
  his friend''s glasses as River, Amy, Rory and Olivia sat with him on a blanket by
  the lake.'
- ! '"Well, I say ''gave''…threw.'
- Salud!"
- ! '"Salud!"'
- ! '"So, when are we going to 1969?"'
- ! '"And since when do you drink wine?"'
- ! '"I''m one thousand, one hundred and three.'
- I must've drunk it sometime," the Doctor replied.
- ! '"What?!"'
- ! '"I told you I was older," he recalled.'
- ! '"Yeah, but when you said over one thousand I thought one thousand and three,
  not…another hundred years after that!"'
- ! '"Oh…sorry," he muttered before taking a drink as Olivia frowned at him in absolute
  confusion before he spit the wine out, making her roll her eyes at him when he sneered,
  "Ew!'
- I thought it would taste more like the gums."
- ! '"I''m with Olivia," Amy agreed.'
- ! '"You were nine hundred and eight the last time we saw you."'
- ! '"And you''ve put on a couple of pounds.'
- I wasn't going to mention it," the Doctor retorted, knowing why she had.
- ! '"Who''s that?"'
- ! '"Who''s who?"'
- ! '"Sorry, what?"'
- ! '"You said you saw something?"'
- ! '"No, I didn''t," Amy frowned in wonder, making Olivia frown as well.'
- ! '"The moon!"'
- ! '"Look at it!'
- Quite right."
- ! '"The moon landing was in ''69," Rory recalled.'
- ! '"Is that where we''re going?"'
- ! '"No," the Doctor murmured as Olivia craned her neck to look at him as he spoke.'
- ! '"A lot more happens in ''69 than anyone remembers."'
- Olivia frowned as he wrapped his arms around her and hugged her tightly, resuming,
  "Human beings…I thought I'd never get done saving you."
- ! '"My love, what''s wrong," she asked him, silently.'
- ! '"I''m getting really nervous."'
- ! '"I know," he replied.'
- ! '"You''ve always been perceptive, Liv.'
- It's one of the things I love about you."
- ! '"Who''s he?"'
- ! '"Oh, my god," River breathed, looking to the lake and turning everyone''s attention
  to it.'
- ! '"What…the…?"'
- ! '"You all need to stay back," the Doctor ordered, gripping Olivia''s hand and
  pulling her ahead a few steps before letting it go and turning to face his friends.'
- ! '"Whatever happens now, you do not interfere.'
- River, keep an eye on Olivia."
- ! '"You''re going to have to be strong, Liv.'
- Promise me."
- ! '"I…I promise," she whispered before he turned to march toward the astronaut.'
- ! '"Well, then," he smiled.'
- ! '"Here we are, at last."'
- ! '"I can''t stop it," River gasped from crying.'
- ! '"The suit''s in control."'
- ! '"You''re not supposed to.'
- This has to happen."
- ! '"Run."'
- ! '"I did run.'
- Running brought me here."
- ! '"I''m trying to fight it, but I can''t.'
- It's too strong."
- ! '"I know.'
- Look over there."
- River's eyes moved to the place where the four were standing and shuddered, "That's
  me.
- How can I be there?"
- ! '"That''s you from the future, serving time for a murder you probably can''t remember.'
- My murder."
- ! '"Why would you do that?'
- Make me watch."
- ! '"So that you know this is inevitable," the Doctor explained as River''s gloved
  hand came up to point at him, slowly.'
- ! '"And you are forgiven.'
- Always and completely forgiven."
- ! '"Please, my love.'
- Please, please, just run."
- ! '"Can''t."'
- ! '"Time can be rewritten."'
- ! '"Don''t you dare.'
- Goodbye, River."
- ! '"Hello, Sweetie," she grinned.'
- ! '"What''ve you done?!"'
- ! '"Well, I think I just drained my weapons systems."'
- ! '"But this is fixed.'
- This is a fixed point in time."
- ! '"Fixed point can be rewritten."'
- ! '"No they can''t!'
- Who told you that?!"
- ! '"Not too many late nights in Gaul, I hope," the Silurian doctor asked The Holy
  Roman Emperor, Winston Churchill, checking his blood pressure.'
- ! '"Just the one," Churchill admitted, looking over some papers as he sat at a huge
  stone table, a dark haired servant pouring him a goblet of water next to him.'
- ! '"I had an argument with Cleopatra.'
- Excellent dancer."
- ! '"I can tell from your blood pressure," the Silurian retorted, making the servant
  girl giggle as he put away his things and Churchill looked to the clock across the
  room.'
- ! '"What time do you have, doctor?"'
- ! '"Two minutes past five, Caesar," he replied.'
- ! '"It''s always two minutes past five, day or night, it''s always two minutes past
  five in the afternoon.'
- Why is that?"
- ! '"Because that is the time, Caesar."'
- ! '"And the date.'
- Does it not bother you?"
- ! '"The date and the time have always been the same, Caesar.'
- Why should it start bothering me now?"
- ! '"I want to see the soothsayer.'
- Where is he?"
- ! '"In the tower…where you threw him the last time."'
- ! '"Get him."'
- ! '"Do you require anything else, Caesar?"'
- ! '"Just your presence when the soothsayer arrives," Churchill replied, turning
  to her as she set down the water pitcher on the table.'
- ! '"He''s much tamer when you''re around, Olivia."'
- ! '"Yes, Caesar," she nodded just as the soothsayer was brought in by two guards.'
- ! '"Leave us," Churchill ordered the guards, and Olivia kept her eyes on the man
  they''d brought in chains, kneeling before Caesar, bowing his head toward the floor.'
- ! '"''Tick tock goes the clock,'' as the old song says," Churchill began.'
- ! '"But they don''t, do they?'
- Explain to me in terms I can understand, what happened to time."
- ! '"A woman."'
- ! '"Take these chains off me and I''ll tell you the entire story," he told Churchill,
  who laughed.'
- ! '"I wasn''t born yesterday, soothsayer," Churchill chuckled.'
- ! '"Forgive me, Caesar," Olivia spoke up, drawing both their attentions and the
  soothsayer smiled at her, as if knowing what she was about to say.'
- ! '"If I may speak freely?'
- He will not try to escape."
- ! '"And how do you know that?"'
- ! '"I just…do," she replied, honestly, making Churchill sigh.'
- ! '"Very well," he shrugged, and stood to unlock the soothsayer''s shackles.'
- ! '"She''s rather perceptive.'
- It's why I keep her around."
- ! '"And she certainly isn''t half bad to look at," the soothsayer smiled to Olivia
  who blushed and looked away, shyly.'
- ! '"Alright, you''re unshackled," Churchill reported, sitting again as the soothsayer
  stood from his knees to sit in a chair at the table as well.'
- ! '"This is absurd," he blurted, standing from his chair.'
- ! '"Other worlds, carnivorous skulls, talking heads.'
- I don't know why I'm listening to you."
- ! '"Because, in another reality, you and I are friends," the soothsayer replied,
  making Olivia frown in wonder at him.'
- ! '"And you sense that.'
- Just like Olivia senses there's something between her and I as well, am I right,
  Liv?"
- ! '"What did you call me?"'
- ! '"I called you what I always call you," the soothsayer replied, and her heart
  rate skyrocketed as he watched her carefully.'
- ! '"You both sense it, just as you sense there is something wrong with time."'
- ! '"You mentioned a woman," Churchill recalled.'
- ! '"Yes," the soothsayer replied, glancing to Olivia.'
- ! '"I''m getting to her."'
- ! '"Is it Olivia, here?"'
- ! '"No," the soothsayer replied, making her heart sink a little.'
- ! '"None of this would be happening if it was her."'
- ! '"What''s she like, then?'
- Attractive, I assume."
- ! '"Hell…in high heels."'
- ! '"Tell me more."'
- ! '"But what was the question?"'
- ! '"Why did it mean you''re death?"'
- ! '"Suppose there was a man who knew a secret," he said.'
- ! '"A terrible, dangerous secret that must never be told.'
- How would you erase that secret from the world, destroy it forever, before it can
  be spoken?"
- ! '"If I had to, I''d destroy the man," Churchill replied.'
- ! '"And Silence…would fall," Olivia murmured, making them both look to her, but
  she looked to the soothsayer to see him smiling down at her before she looked away.'
- ! '"All the times I''ve heard those words I never realized it was my silence…my
  death.'
- The Doctor will fall."
- ! '"I''m sorry," she whispered.'
- ! '"I don''t know why I''m crying."'
- ! '"You will," the Doctor sighed before looking around the room and asked, "Why
  are we here?"'
- ! '"This?"'
- ! '"This is the Senate Room."'
- ! '"Why did we leave your office?"'
- ! '"Didn''t we want a stroll?"'
- ! '"Someone…wanted a stroll."'
- ! '"Liv, you''ve been running," he murmured then looked to Churchill who lifted
  his revolver to examine it.'
- ! '"Why do you have your revolver?"'
- ! '"Well…" Churchill began, frowning in thought before resuming, "You''re dangerous
  company, Soothsayer."'
- The Doctor looked to his left arm, noticing a mark on it then muttered, "Yes.
- I think I am."
- ! '"Resume your story," Churchill entreated, and the Doctor began again, but he
  stopped short when he came to the part about the letters.'
- ! '"I had a friend take my letters to someone who could deliver them for me," he
  explained, gripping Olivia''s hand tightly and she had to admit, it felt so right
  to be holding his hand.'
- ! '"Someone I trusted.'
- My right hand…girl."
- ! '"What…me?"'
- ! '"I was there."'
- ! '"Yes, Liv, you were," he urged, almost desperately.'
- ! '"Always, all the time, you were there, by my side.'
- Please…remember."
- ! '"Why would you do this?"'
- ! '"Of all the things you''ve told me, this, I find hardest to believe.'
- Why would you invite your friends to see your death?"
- ! '"I had to die," the Doctor replied, still looking at Olivia as she looked up
  and met his gaze with wide eyes, something clicking in her mind as he lifted a hand
  to stroke her cheek.'
- ! '"I didn''t have to die alone.'
- So has my wife."
- ! '"And did you tell them this was going to happen?"'
- ! '"Caesar, with all due respect, it would really help if you didn''t ask so many
  questions," Olivia blurted, making the Doctor grin.'
- ! '"There''s my girl," he murmured as she grinned back at him, but he looked to
  his arm where the mark had been to find two more next to it and he whispered, "We
  don''t have much time."'
- ! '"And this woman you spoke of, did you invite her?"'
- ! '"Yes, she was there," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"River Song came twice."'
- ! '"Well, what happened?"'
- ! '"Nothing," the Doctor replied.'
- ! '"Nothing?"'
- ! '"Nothing happened and then it kept happening," the Doctor explained.'
- ! '"Or, if you''d prefer, everything happened at once and it won''t ever stop.'
- A needle stuck on a record."
- ! '"A record?"'
- ! '"Good lord, man, have you never heard of downloads?"'
- ! '"Said Winston Churchill," Olivia smirked, making the Doctor give a chuckle, but
  she suddenly felt his grip around her waist tighten on her, protectively…and she
  smelled something in the air.'
- ! '"Gunsmoke!'
- That's Gunsmoke," Churchill identified the scent then sighed in relief as he lifted
  his suddenly smoking pistol.
- ! '"Oh!'
- I appear to have fired this."
- ! '"We seem to be defending ourselves," the Doctor noticed, just as puzzled.'
- ! '"I don''t understand," Churchill admitted as Olivia suddenly recognized what
  must have been causing this.'
- ! '"The creatures that lead the Silence," the Doctor explained to Churchill in a
  low tone.'
- ! '"Remarkable beings.'
- They're memory-proof."
- ! '"But what does that mean?"'
- ! '"You can''t remember them," Olivia explained as they began trying to back out
  of the room, the Doctor''s eyes darting around them.'
- ! '"You look away, you forget them."'
- ! '"Don''t panic," he whispered.'
- ! '"In small numbers, they''re not too difficult."'
- ! '"Keep the Silence in sight at all times," someone ordered, their guns pointed
  at the ceiling as the Doctor and Olivia tried to recover themselves from being blasted
  to the floor, coughing through the smoke.'
- ! '"And keep your eye drives active."'
- ! '"Who the devil are you?"'
- ! '"Identify yourselves!"'
- ! '"Pond," the figure announced, still stepping toward them, and that''s when Olivia
  noticed the gun in her hand.'
- ! '"Amelia Pond."'
- ! '"No!'
- It's ok, Winston."
- ! '"Uh, darling…I''m not sure that it is," Olivia called, making him look to Amy
  as she stopped in front of them…revealing her eye patch over her right eye.'
- ! '"No," the Doctor breathed.'
- ! '"No, Amy.'
- Why are you wearing that?"
- ! '"No!'
- Amy, don't—!"
- ! '"I''m gonna kill you—!"'
- ! '"Oh, stop bein'' so dramatic!"'
- ! '"He''s just unconscious!'
- Get 'em both to the train."
- ! '"Amy," he murmured.'
- ! '"Those stun guns aren''t fun," Amy admitted.'
- ! '"I''m sorry.'
- We'll be in Cairo shortly."
- ! '"How do you feel?"'
- He said nothing for a moment as he just smiled at her then lifted a hand to stroke
  her face before looking back at Amy, saying, "Amy Pond.
- Please, listen to me."
- ! '"Don''t try getting up so quickly!"'
- ! '"I know it seems impossible, but you know me," the Doctor continued, sitting
  up as he found his equilibrium again, speaking to Amy as she just stared at him.'
- ! '"In another version of reality you and I were best friends.'
- We all traveled together, we had adventures."
- ! '"Amelia Pond," he continued, struggling to walk.'
- ! '"You grew up with a time rift in the wall of your bedroom.'
- You can remember things that never happened."
- ! '"And if you try, if you really, really try, you''ll be able to—"'
- ! '"You look rubbish," Amy smiled as he turned back to her with a grin.'
- ! '"You look wonderful," he shot back with a smile, tossing the small TARDIS back
  to her, which she caught.'
- ! '"So do you," she retorted.'
- ! '"But don''t worry."'
- ! '"We''ll fix that," Olivia smiled, coming up behind him and swinging her arm around
  his shoulder from behind to press a hanger against him that held a jacket, a bowtie,
  a shirt, pants and suspenders."'
- ! '"Geronimo," he smiled, lifting a hand to hold the ensemble to his chest as she
  let it go and stepped around him.'
- ! '"No clothes for you?"'
- ! '"Who needs clothes?"'
- ! '"Be back, Amy!"'
- ! '"Oh, my god, I missed you," she shuddered before pulling away and looking him
  over, her hands stroking through his hair.'
- ! '"You do look terrible."'
- ! '"You look gorgeous, as always, Liv," he whispered, leaning in to kiss her cheek
  and hug her tightly again.'
- ! '"Help me get dressed?"'
- ! '"I''m usually helping you get undressed," she smirked, unable to help herself.'
- ! '"That too," he replied, smiling as well.'
- ! '"This toga has to come off first, after all."'
- ! '"If I get you out of this toga, you won''t be getting into that suit for a while."'
- ! '"I''ll take care of everything, then.'
- You can shave off my whiskers then tie up my bowtie, eh?"
- ! '"Fair deal.'
- I accept."
- ! '"Ok, you can turn around now," the Doctor told Amy, even though as he stepped
  out of the room, clothed and shaved but his hair was still long with Olivia''s hand
  in his she was staring right at him.'
- ! '"How do I look?"'
- ! '"Cool."'
- ! '"Really?!"'
- ! '"No."'
- ! '"Cool office, though," the Doctor noticed, stepping toward her desk and ignoring
  her insult.'
- ! '"Why do you have an office?"'
- ! '"Are you like a special agent boss lady, or something?"'
- ! '"Not sure about the eye patch, though."'
- ! '"It''s not an eye patch," Amy corrected then explained, "Time''s gone wrong.'
- You'll see."
- ! '"And you''ve got an office on a train," the Doctor grinned.'
- ! '"That is so cool.'
- Train/office on the TARDIS?"
- ! '"God, I''ve missed you!"'
- ! '"Ok!"'
- ! '"Hugging and missing now!'
- Where's the Roman?"
- ! '"You mean Rory?"'
- ! '"My husband Rory, yeah?'
- I can't find him, but I love him very much, don't I?"
- ! '"Apparently," the Doctor retorted, looking at the drawing of someone who was
  very not Rory, and Olivia bit her lip to keep from saying anything.'
- ! '"I have to keep doing this," Amy explained, setting the paper down.'
- ! '"Writing and drawing things.'
- It's just so hard to keep remembering."
- ! '"Well, it''s not your fault," the Doctor assured her.'
- ! '"Time''s gone wrong.'
- Do you remember why?"
- ! '"The lakeside," Amy confirmed.'
- ! '"Lake Silencio, Utah.'
- I died."
- ! '"But then you didn''t die.'
- See I remember it twice, different ways."
- ! '"So do I," Olivia chimed in, taking the Doctor''s arm, but he pulled it out of
  her grasp to wrap it around her shoulders.'
- ! '"Two different versions of the same event, both happening in the same moment,
  time split wide open.'
- All of history happening at once."
- ! '"But does it matter?"'
- ! '"I mean, can''t we just stay like this?"'
- ! '"Time isn''t just frozen, Amy," Olivia replied, and though she tried to hide
  it, only the Doctor heard the sorrow in her tone.'
- ! '"It''s disintegrating.'
- It'll spread and reality will fall apart."
- ! '"Ma''am, we''re about to arrive," the man with an eye patch in military fatigues
  and a beret announced.'
- ! '"Eye drives need to be activated as soon as we disembark."'
- ! '"Good point," Amy nodded as Olivia and the Doctor glanced between them, recognizing
  him.'
- ! '"Thank you, Captain Williams."'
- ! '"Hello," the Doctor nodded with a grin and Olivia waved, excitedly.'
- ! '"Hello, Sir," Rory nodded politely.'
- ! '"Miss.'
- Pleased to meet you."
- ! '"Captain Williams," Amy introduced.'
- ! '"Best of the best.'
- Couldn't live without him."
- Olivia brushed her thumb over her wedding band, finding her telepathic bond with
  the Doctor to say, "That is so their relationship."
- The Doctor lifted the sketch Amy had made of what she thought Rory looked like and
  he laughed at it before blurting, "No."
- ! '"What is wrong?"'
- ! '"Amy, you''ll find Rory," she assured her.'
- ! '"You always do.'
- But really look, ok?"
- ! '"I am looking," she retorted.'
- ! '"I believe you," Olivia nodded, taking her face in her hands.'
- ! '"But you don''t look hard enough, sometimes."'
- ! '"Why does he look older?"'
- Amy whispered as the Doctor stepped closer to them, drawing her attention to him
  and she said, "If time isn't passing then how can you be aging, Doctor?"
- ! '"Time is still passing for me," he explained.'
- ! '"Every explosion has an epicenter.'
- I'm what's wrong."
- ! '"What''s wrong with you?"'
- ! '"I''m still alive."'
- ! '"This is a cold part of the world."'
- ! '"Temperature feels fine.'
- And the gravity is low."
- ! '"Yes but you''re a Time Lord.'
- My world is warmer than yours."
- ! '"The temperature is fine!"'
- ! '"Now let''s see what there is around here."'
- ! '"Let''s climb the mountain.'
- We can find out what that building is" he said excitedly.
- ! '"Couldn''t you simply fly the TARDIS up there?"'
- ! '"No, that''s boring!"'
- ! '"Climbing will be better."'
- ! '"You know what we have to do" said the man.'
- ! '"Yes Guhi" said one of the Sycorax.'
- ! '"We get into the Monastry, take the box, and…" "Alright!'
- You've shown you know enough" said Guhi.
- ! '"Switch to manual pilot."'
- ! '"Soon the box will be ours!"'
- ! '"This place doesn''t seem very interesting" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"I think we should leave.'
- This mountain wasn't really worth climbing."
- ! '"No need to be such a grumpy guy!"'
- ! '"You really don''t want to have a good…" A spaceship shot overhead and landed
  in the Monastery courtyard.'
- ! '"…Time" finished the Doctor.'
- ! '"I recognise that one!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Guhi Stab-Hand from the Jovian Colonies" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"He was on the Galaxy''s Most Wanted on some 36th Century show!"'
- ! '"What time scale are you using?"'
- ! '"Something from long after your time" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"The show said Guhi is a brutal thief, murderer and mercenary.'
- I'm going to find out what he's up to!"
- ! '"The Monastry of the Green Moon?'
- I've heard of this place!"
- ! '"Alright Monks" he said.'
- ! '"Surrender the Demon Box and I will leave here without killing any of you."'
- ! '"Don''t take it!"'
- ! '"It must remain… AAARRRGGGHHHHH!"'
- ! '"That was a warning" said Guhi as another Monk rushed forward and pulled the
  wounded Monk inside.'
- ! '"Stab-Hand!"'
- ! '"You really didn''t need to break that lock.'
- You ruined a nice door!"
- ! '"You dare…" "OK.'
- I give the dare" said the Doctor.
- ! '"Let me think a moment.'
- You have to drink…" "Leave now and you live!"
- ! '"OK, OK!"'
- ! '"Now, where were we?"'
- ! '"You could have ruined my jacket!"'
- ! '"And I don''t think there are any decent suit repairs on this planet!"'
- ! '"We found it!"'
- ! '"Sticks!"'
- ! '"We will easily… OOOOFFF!"'
- ! '"Quite a fight" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"In my third body I''d like to join in."'
- ! '"I''m not used to fighting" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"And those Monks seem to be doing well."'
- ! '"I should get involved" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"GET THAT ANNOYING FOOL!"'
- ! '"An annoying fool?'
- Where?"
- ! '"If you shouldn''t run with scissors, don''t run with a sword!"'
- ! '"Quick!'
- Leave!"
- ! '"Just because we''re a Monastry don''t think we don''t have technology!"'
- ! '"I called the Police immediately!"'
- ! '"I need help.'
- I've been wounded!"
- ! '"You''ll slow us down and we can''t have you giving away our location!"'
- ! '"No!'
- Don't…" began the Sycorax but the Stab-Hand shot to his throat.
- ! '"What exactly was that box?"'
- ! '"Where are they going?'
- I didn't get close enough to read their minds!"
- ! '"Yes, I also want to know what was so important about it" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"It opens the Door of the Demon" said a Monk.'
- ! '"What is the Door of the Demon?"'
- ! '"I will tell you" said the Monk.'
- ! '"A story" said the Doctor happily.'
- ! '"I love stories!'
- Do any of you know what a Jammy Dodger is?"
- ! '"He''s not from this Galaxy" he said.'
- ! '"There is a story that many generations ago a Demon…"'
- ! '"So this was Guhi Stab-Hand?"'
- ! '"That''s right" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"We''ll alert authorities in the nearest systems, but he''s wanted in most of
  the Galaxy anyway" said the Officer.'
- ! '"I''m sure I can pursue him" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Sorry, but I doubt you''d be better than us" said the Officer.'
- ! '"So are you going to check out the Green Moon?"'
- ! '"The Monks said the box could be used to release a Demon there."'
- ! '"Nobody believes that stuff anymore.'
- You stay here while I question others."
- ! '"Quick!'
- We need to leave now!"
- ! '"But the Police…" "I know where he is going but the Police didn''t believe it"
  said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Come on!"'
- ! '"Just a few minutes with my sonic should loosen this up" said the Doctor, beginning
  his work.'
- ! '"Stop!"'
- ! '"He''s getting pretty close!"'
- ! '"I''m sure there''s something I''ve forgotten" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"The seatbelts!'
- The control can't drive until it is done up."
- ! '"Doctor…" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"Just a moment…WHOOOAAA" cried the Doctor as the Hover-vehicle shot of the edge
  of the mountain.'
- ! '"I really should have come here in my Third body" said the Doctor as the ground
  rushed towards them.'
- ! '"GERONIMO!"'
- ! '"We''re getting there!"'
- ! '"STOP!"'
- ! '"Where are we going?"'
- ! '"Can''t you guess?"'
- ! '"The Green Moon?"'
- ! '"Right" said the Time Lord happily.'
- ! '"But maybe they are not trying to release this Demon" Kafyip pointed out.'
- ! '"Maybe they just want a valuable artefact."'
- ! '"Well, we might as well try the Green Moon" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Off we go!"'
- ! '"Look!"'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Strong energy reading from that section of the Moon" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Something which shouldn''t be there.'
- So we'd better go there!"
- ! '"Are you sure this is the right region?"'
- ! '"I have the map, which is why I am piloting the ship.'
- Do not question me!"
- ! '"What are those?"'
- ! '"Things any of us can easily kill" said Guhi.'
- ! '"What are you waiting for?'
- Begin searching!"
- ! '"Gravity about an eighth of Dupug, a thin atmosphere but breathable enough, we
  should be fine!"'
- ! '"No need to be frightened" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Just the local fauna."'
- ! '"These creatures may be the reason the prison is here" pointed out Kafyip.'
- ! '"Could be" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"But they can''t keep an interested Time Lord away."'
- ! '"We should follow them" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"But they would see us" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"They could kill us.'
- You saw how ruthless they… UUUUHHH!"
- ! '"Easily solved" said the Doctor rising, but Kafyip pulled him down.'
- ! '"If they see us they''ll kill us!"'
- ! '"I don''t think we''ll be left in much better shape if the spiders get us" said
  the Doctor.'
- ! '"I hate spiders."'
- ! '"So what now?"'
- ! '"Shoot them!"'
- ! '"These beasts are why I told you to save your weapons at the Monastry!"'
- ! '"Into the cave now!"'
- ! '"It is a small cave" he said.'
- ! '"Not at all good for hide and seek."'
- ! '"Looks like it isn''t in here" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"We need to find where the entrance is before them" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"Yes, that was obvious" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Kafyip, could you just do a quick errand for me?"'
- ! '"Pop through that cave and see where Guhi and the Sycorax are.'
- Perhaps we can think up something there."
- ! '"Doctor…" he said.'
- ! '"Just checking the sonic effect" he said.'
- ! '"They''re in one of the caves but they should be out soon" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"Do you have any ideas on how to find the cave?"'
- ! '"My sonic could do so!"'
- ! '"Just need a wide open space."'
- ! '"There!"'
- ! '"This prison must be tiny" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"I saw the outside of this cave.'
- There can't be much behind that door."
- ! '"I doubt that is just a door.'
- Remember the TARDIS."
- ! '"I think we should leave" he said, staggering.'
- ! '"Don''t leave yet!"'
- ! '"One of the Sycorax remained outside.'
- You saved me a bit of time."
- ! '"We helped you out.'
- So what's our reward?"
- ! '"A quick death… unless you show me how to use the key."'
- ! '"How do we know you''ll let us go anyway?"'
- ! '"I swear that if you do not show me how to use the Key you will die."'
- ! '"I know this loophole..."'
- ! '"Open the door!"'
- ! '"Now!"'
- ! '"I think I''ve seen this before…" he said.'
- ! '"It''s the symbols of the High Minds!"'
- ! '"Who are they?"'
- ! '"Very evolved and powerful beings of this Galaxy" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Their origins aren''t clear.'
- I've often wanted to meet one…" "I don't care who made this!"
- ! '"Open that door!"'
- ! '"But if the High Minds imprisoned something they must have had a good reason
  to do so" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Anyway, why do you want to open this door?'
- The "Demon" from the sound of it could destroy us all."
- ! '"Because of the power that must lie behind that door!"'
- ! '"If a really powerful being was imprisoned behind that door it will reward me
  for letting it out!'
- Those Monks could pay a fortune to get it back."
- ! '"But what gave you the idea in the first place?"'
- ! '"Why should I tell you?"'
- ! '"Now open that door!"'
- ! '"Don''t do it Doctor!"'
- ! '"If what you say is true we can''t let whatever is there out."'
- ! '"I felt something terrible behind that door.'
- I felt like it will destroy us all if we let it out."
- ! '"I''ll kill you if you don''t shut up!"'
- ! '"And you''ll both die if that door isn''t open soon!"'
- ! '"I can come back.'
- But Kafyip…" "If you think I should die I'm sure it is for a good cause" said Kafyip.
- ! '"You have a good mind Doctor."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"I''d advise you to look behind you" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"You think I''ll…" said Guhi but a Sycorax interrupted him.'
- ! '"Behind us!"'
- ! '"Doctor, what about us?"'
- ! '"I can ward them away with the sonic screwdriver" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"I just needed to find the right frequency.'
- I was doing that earlier."
- ! '"I''ll find this…" He suddenly laughed.'
- ! '"Of course!"'
- ! '"It does work!'
- Now to know the power behind this door!"
- Kafyip moved to help him but suddenly cried "Look!"
- ! '"Kafyip!'
- NO!"
- ! '"Don''t fire…" "I''m not afraid of you!"'
- ! '"Kill them!"'
- ! '"You caused this!"'
- ! '"HOLD ON!"'
- ! '"That was pretty close" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"It was probably better for Guhi he died before going through the door" he said.'
- ! '"I don''t know what was behind that door.'
- But it certainly seemed terrifying."
- ! '"No need to worry about him!"'
- ! '"Just as I thought" he said.'
- ! '"An inter-dimensional door."'
- ! '"Is the door closed?"'
- ! '"Yes" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"I don''t know what was behind there… It felt like Sutekh or the Beast.'
- I'm not coming to this Moon again."
- ! '"And the box?"'
- ! '"We obviously can''t leave it here."'
- ! '"Good point" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"I know the right place for it" he said.'
- ! '"Back to the TARDIS.'
- But we have one last thing to do before we go…"
- ! '"Some left-over Nitro-9" he said.'
- ! '"Been in that fridge for many years."'
- ! '"Now to put the box away" he said, running to the stairs.'
- ! '"Doctor, the Monks…" said Kafyip.'
- ! '"Of course!"'
- ! '"I''ll tell them the box is in safe hands!"'
- ! '"No need to worry.'
- Only me" he said.
- ! '"Take me to your Leader!"'
- ! '"I''m already here" said an elderly Monk.'
- ! '"Was the door of the Demon opened?"'
- ! '"Yes.'
- But I closed it before anything got out" said the Doctor.
- ! '"I''m also here to tell you that I am protecting your box for you."'
- ! '"And that the thieves died on the Green Moon.'
- Next to the biggest crater on the side facing us."
- ! '"It is fine for us to keep the box?"'
- ! '"We know how to look into minds.'
- But remember…" "…to be careful.
- I know, forces of evil won't get it."
- ! '"Goodbye Doctor" said the Old Monk.'
- Bye!"
- ! '"That sound… it sounds familiar!"'
- ! '"That was the Doctor.'
- He says all but one of the thieves died near the largest crater the side of the
  Green Moon facing us."
- ! '"You didn''t call me earlier?'
- He's wanted!"
- ! '"Well, I''ll report what he said and we''ll check the Green Moon."'
- ! '"This is the Dupug Police!'
- You will remain there!"
- ! '"Useful box this" said the Doctor.'
- ! '"Could withstand an atom bomb.'
- Though means you have to leave it for quite some time for the radiation level to
  drop to a safe level."
- ! '"What are you talking about?"'
- ! '"Oh yes.'
- Your species doesn't have atomic bombs" said the Doctor.
- ! '"Well you can do fine without them."'
- ! '"Did I lock the box?"'
- ! '"Yes" he said shutting the door again.'
- ! '"Well that''s the box protected."'
- ! '"Well, where next?"'
- ! '"Earth!"'
- ! '"I have the where set.'
- Now it's the choice of the TARDIS when we are!"

- Not ever."
- ! '"Well you can at least stop sulking around this house!"'
- ! '"For God''s sake Rose, you''re almost 21!'

- There's a Heinrick's just down town, maybe you could—"

- My point is, you need to do SOMETHING besides mope."
- ! '"Oh don''t frown at me, young lady.'
- Honestly, you're like a child."

- That would make it all too real."but I can't.
- Please try to understand."

- Richard "Roady" Colbert had been Rose's field operation's partner since the day
  she joined the team.
- Mickey Smith, his fellow field ops member, had told him then, "Don't worry about
  her, mate.
- Don't take it too personally, she does that to everyone."
- Over the next year, he hardly saw Rose Tyler again, barely saying "Good morning"
  passing in the lifts.
- ! '"Course, we did have another plan," Roady continued.'
- ! '"if you got too far, Mitch was gonna follow ya and tackle ya to the ground!"'

- I think he just came for the free food."
- ! '"''M sorry.'
- I know I'm being daft."
- ! '"It''s not daft, you ninny."'
- ! '"It''s just something for another time, yeah?"'
- ! '"Yeah."'
- ! '"You built a DIMENSION CROSSING DEVICE without telling me?!"'
- ! '"Rose honey, calm down."'
- ! '"Don''t tell me to calm down!'
- How can i bloody calm down when you've been lyin' to me this whole time!?"
- ! '"We weren''t lyin'' to ya, sweethear''!'
- We just weren't ready to tell you yet."
- ! '"You knew about this too?"'
- ! '"Anythin'' else you''re not tellin'' me?"'
- ! '"Why don''t you and I go talk about this outside, yeah?"'
- ! '"Rose, maybe you should listen to ''im."'
- ! '"Did you know about this as well?"'
- ! '"Of course not!"'

- The alien, I mean."
- ! '"Hmm?'
- Tell ya what else we lost that day, though...a smidge of Jackson's dignity!"
- ! '"Shut up, Mitch."'
- ! '"Oh c''mon Jackson," Roady laughed, slapping his shoulder in a friendly manner.'
- ! '"We''ve all ''ad our fair share of humiliatin'' experiences in the field."'
- ! '"Tha''s right."'
- ! '"Like just last week when i was bringing Roady here his cuppa, I walked right
  up behind him and tapped him on the shoulder.'
- He jumped so high, he fell on his arse trippin' over his own feet," More laughter.
- Rose continued, "and we hadn't even seen the aliens yet!"
- ! '"That reminds me of something funny."'
- ! '"Just last week I was bringing Dr.'
- ! 'Anyway,—" '
- ! '"Wait, cannon, what cannon?"'
- ! '"The dimension cannon.'
- You know, the machine like the one that Mickey and Jake and the others used when..."
- ! '"I thought you knew.'
- Director Tyler's been supervising the project for months now, I just assumed..."
- ! '"Rose, wait!"'
- ! '"What did I say?"'
- ! '"How could you keep something like this from me?'
- After everything I've been through, don't you think I should be the FIRST to know
  about a dimension cannon!?"
- ! '"Rose..."'
- ! '"And why the hell is Dr.'
- There are much better scientists employed here!"
- ! '"Rose, I—"'
- ! '"I''m not finished yet, Director!"'
- ! '"Well I am finished with you, agent Tyler!"'
- ! '"Sit down!"'
- ! '"I was going to tell you, Rosie.'
- Your mum and I were gonna tell you tomorrow, as a birthday surprise."
- ! '"So I''ve been acting like like an outright git for no reason then?"'
- ! '"Pretty much, yeah."'
- ! '"Oh, I feel awful now!"'
- ! '"I am so so sorry."'
- ! '"That''s alright, sweetheart.'
- The dimension cannon works."
- ! '"What, you mean...I can..."'
- ! '"Yes, Rose."'
- ! '"You can go back to him."'
- ! '"Rose, we''re ready for you now," Martha called.'
- ! '"Be careful, love."'

- I love you."

- Take care of mum 'n dad while I'm away, alright?"
- ! '"Of course, Sissy!"'
- ! '"You sure all this is worth it, sweethear''?"'
- ! '"Of course it is."'
- ! '"Alright Rose let''s get started."'
- ! '"Step up to the platform and plant your feet firmly, shoulder width apart.'
- Do you have the hand-held with you?"
- ! '"Since I didn''t get to give you somethin'' at your party...here."'
- ! '"Oh Roady, ''s beautiful!"'
- ! '"I love it, thank you."'
- ! '"''S made of that material those aliens gave us last month...the Armallians,
  I think they were called.'
- Figured, wherever you end up with the cannon thing, it'll come in 'andy."
- ! '"Thank you.'
- It really means a lot to me."
- ! '"How do I look?"'
- ! '"Like a model.'
- Kate Moss, even."
- ! '"Absolutely gorgeous!"Rose joined in his laughing and plopped back down on his
  living room couch.'
- ! '"So...when do you start...dimension jumping?"'
- ! '"Monday.'
- So I won't be at the bunkers tomorrow."
- ! '"Oh."'
- ! '"...what are ya gonna do...you know, if you...actually make it back?"'
- ! '"I''m gonna find him."'
- ! '"I''m gonna find him, and I''m never gonna let ''im outta my sight again."'
- ! '"Yes, I''ve got the hand-held right here."'
- ! '"Excellent!'
- Did you get the tracker?"
- ! '"Good!"'
- ! '"Since the dimension cannon does not have a specified destination, we have no
  way of keeping an open communication from you to the controls.'
- You will be connected to Torchwood the whole time."
- ! '"Have I forgotten anything Martha?"'
- ! '"I believe you''ve covered everything, Sir.'
- We are ready to begin."
- ! '"Wish me luck, everybody."'
- ! '"Good luck, Rose."'
- ! '"Starting the sequence," Martha said.'
- ! '"Initiating the time boost.'
- Launching in three...two...one..."
- ! '"What happened?'
- Did it work?"
- ! '"The tracking signal has activated," Martha breathed, relieved.'
- ! '"Rose Tyler is now online.'
- She made it through, it worked!"
- ! '"It worked!"'
- ! '"That better be bloody important."'
- ! '"Pete Tyler here."'
- ! '"I''ll be right there."'
- ! '"W''s wrong?"'
- ! '"it''s two o''clock in the mornin'', Pete, what''s so urgent that they couldn''t
  wait five more hours?"'
- ! '"There''s a problem, Jacks."'
- ! '"A problem with what?'
- Couldn't it wait?"
- ! '"Not this time."'
- ! '"It''s the dimension cannon."'
- ! '"Ah, Director Tyler.'
- My apologies for disturbing you in the middle of the night."
- ! '"Not at all, Dr.'
- Caroline, so long as we can solve whatever is going on."
- ! '"Of course.'
- I've taken the liberty of contacting Rose as well, she should be here any minute."
- ! '"Good.'
- Now what exactly is wrong with the cannon?"
- ! '"Well, I am not one hundred percent sure it is the cannon.'
- Now the cannon has never done that before, so I looked into it and this is what
  I found."
- ! '"What is it?"'
- ! '"This is a diagram of the star systems.'
- Not just ours, but all the other dimensions Rose has traveled to in the last month."
- ! '"But...it looks almost empty."'
- ! '"Exactly."'
- ! '"This is the same diagram, the satellite picture taken twelve days ago.'
- ! '"Oh, God," he choked out.'
- ! '"what could this mean for us?"'
- ! '"I don''t know...but it doesn''t seem good."'
- ! '"''M here!'
- What is it, whats happened?"
- ! '"The stars are going out."'
- ! '"You''re still goin'' back after seein'' ''ow dangerous it can be?"'
- ! '"I have to.'
- I've gotta find him, he's the only one who can help us with the stars."
- ! '"Isn''t that what bloody Torchwood is for?'
- Saving the universe?"
- ! '"Bloody Torchwood is the one askin'' for his help.'
- We need him."
- ! '"Yeah, well I hate him!"'
- ! '"Every time you talk about him, all you get is miserable.'
- This universe has been just fine without 'im, and we certainly don't need 'im now!"
- Without making eye contact, Rose spoke softly, "I had no idea you felt this way,
  Roady."
- ! '"That''s because you never listen!"'
- ! '"Jesus Rose, I''ve been tryin'' to tell you how I feel for two bloody years!'
- I don't want you to go back to 'I'm 'cause I love you!"
- ! '"Oh Roady, I—"'
- ! '"Don''t!"'
- ! '"Don''t you start on how you ''can''t because it hurts too much,'' or how ''I
  wouldn''t understand.'''
- When are you gonna wake up and see that you need to forget the past and start looking
  to the future...a future with...me."
- ! '"Rose, I would never leave you."'
- ! '"I''m sorry Roady...but I made my choice a long time ago...I chose The Doctor"
  she spoke his name for the first time since Bad Wolf Bay.'
- ! '"and I always will.'
- He's my best friend."
- ! '"Fine.'
- You don't need me."
- ! '"Roady, wait!"'
- ! '"Good luck with your precious Doctor!"'
- ! '"...Fine!"'
- ! '"I don''t need your permission to go back, anyway!"'
- ! '"Oh, Doctor."'
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Hey Roady!"'
- ! '"Where''s Rose?"'
- ! '"Busy," he said the word with air-quotes.'
- ! '"again."'
- ! '"She''s been at it all week.'
- She should take a break every once in a while."
- ! '"Yeah, try tellin'' her that.'
- Doesn't listen to nobody."
- ! '"You alright, Roady?"'
- ! '"Yeah, sure."'
- ! '"Ohhhh," Jake smiled knowingly.'
- ! '"I know that look.'
- ! '"Is it that obvious?"'
- ! '"Are you kidding?"'
- ! '"Half of bloody Torchwood can tell, mate."'
- ! '"I told her I loved her."'
- ! '"She''s never goin'' to speak to me again."'
- ! '"Relax, mate.'
- She'll warm up to you."
- ! '"Tha''s easy for you ta say, Jake.'
- You've already got'a girlfriend."
- ! '"Yeah, but Tosh and I still fight sometimes," Jake countered.'
- ! '"and I''ve learned that when a woman''s mad at you, givin'' ''em space is the
  best thing to do.'
- Trust me."
- ! '"Oops.'
- Duty calls."
- ! '"Look, Roady.'
- We both knew we weren't right for each other, we just didn't want to admit it."
- ! '"I didn''t want to admit it...but she was movin'' on.'
- ! '''Cept me, apparently."'
- ! '"With that Doctor?"'
- ! '"Yeah..."'
- ! '"Bloody Doctor."'
- ! '"Tell me about it, mate."'
- ! '"What I''m getin'' at is...''s her and The Doctor, it always will be.'
- I mean, bein' Rose's friend...that's great, go for it, but expectin' anythin' more...you're
  wasting your time."
- ! '"See ya up at the bunkers."'
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe or any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Okay Rose," Dr.'
- ! '"To the best of our ability, we have found the way back to the parallel earth...your
  earth..'
- now don't be too hopeful, there is always a possibility for error."
- ! '"I understand.'
- But if we're right, I'll find 'im."
- ! '"Excellent!'
- Jones?"
- ! '"Starting the time boost...launching in three..."'
- ! '"two..."'
- ! '"one..."'
- ! '"What happened?'
- What did they find?"
- ! '"Sorry, did they find someone?"'
- ! '"I dunno, um.."'
- ! '"bloke called The Doctor or...or somethin''."'
- ! '"Where is he, then?"'
- ! '"They...took him away...he''s dead."'
- ! '"I''m sorry, did you know ''im?'
- ! '"I mean, they didn''t say his name.'
- ! '''could be any Doctor."'
- ! '"I came so far."'
- ! '"It—it could be anyone."'
- ! '"What''s your name?"'
- ! '"Donna.'
- And you?"
- ! '"Oh, I was just...passing by..."'
- ! '"I shouldn''t even be here.'
- This is wrong, this is...wrong...this is so wrong."
- ! '"Sorry, what was it?'
- Donna what?"
- ! '"Why do you keep lookin'' at my back?"'
- ! '"I''m not."'
- ! '"Yes you are," Donna said angrily.'
- ! '"You keep lookin'' behind me.'
- What's there?"
- ! '"Well?'
- Did you find him?"
- ! '"No, ''s not him.'
- I that universe, He's…The Doctor, he's—he's dead."
- ! '"But there was this woman, Donna something, and I think she can help.'
- I just need to go back there, now."
- ! '"Rose you just got back.'
- You at least need some rest."
- ! '"I don''t care.'
- We're desperate."
- After a few minutes, he finally spoke, "Start it up again, Dr.
- Jones."
- ! '"Initiating time boosts," Martha repeated.'
- ! '"Launching in three…two…one…"'
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe and any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Blimey!"'
- ! '"You alright?"'
- ! '"What was that light, fireworks or—"'
- ! '"I dunno," Rose lied.'
- ! '"I was just…walkin'' along.'
- That's weird."
- ! '"You''re the one…Christmas Eve, I met you in town."'
- ! '"Donna, isn''t it?"'
- ! '"What was your name?"'
- ! '"How''re you doing?'
- You're looking good."
- ! '"How''s things?'
- What you been up to?"
- ! '"You''re doin'' it again."'
- ! '"What?"'
- ! '"Lookin'' behind me.'
- People keep doing that, lookin' at my back."
- ! '"What sort of people?"'
- ! '"People in the streets, strangers.'
- I just catch 'em sometimes, starin' at me, like they're lookin' at something…and
  then I get home, and I look, and there's nothing there!"
- ! '"See?'
- Look, now I'm doing it!"
- ! '"What are you doin'' for Christmas?"'
- ! '"What am I what?"'
- ! '"Next Christmas, any plans?"'
- ! '"I dunno, that''s ages away!'
- Why?"
- ! '"Just, I think you should get out, you and your family.'
- Don't stay in London, just…leave the city."
- Donna narrowed her eyes, "What for?"
- ! '"Nice hotel, Christmas break?"'
- ! '"Can''t afford it."'
- ! '"Well, no you—you got that lottery ticket."'
- ! '"How do you know about that?"'
- ! '"First prize, luxury break weekend."'
- ! '"Use it, Donna Noble."'
- ! '"…Why won''t you tell me your name?"'
- ! '"I think, you should leave me alone."'
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe and any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Tell him this—two words."'
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe and any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Don''t you dare follow me, mum.'
- It's too dangerous for you."
- ! '"You were gone for weeks, Rose.'
- You could have died and I'd 'ave never've known 'bout it."
- ! '"People were startin'' to think you''d gone AWOL."'
- ! '"This is different.'
- Whatever's powerful enough to pull that off is like nothin' you've ever seen before,
  and I can't let you go."
- ! '"You shouldn''t go either sweetheart, if it''s as dangerous as you say."'
- ! '"I have to find The Doctor."'
- ! '"Oh, you and your bloody Doctor."'
- ! '"He''s the only one who can help us."'
- ! '"But it isn''t about us, is it?'
- God, I hate that man."
- ! '"Don''t say that!'
- You know it's not true, think of all he's done for ya."
- ! '"All he''s done is steal my only daughter away from me.'
- Now he's doin' it again!"
- ! '"I''m going, mum, that''s the end of it.'
- Now go, home."
- Jackie continued to follow, jogging to keep up."
- ! '"You don''t tell me what to do, young lady.'
- If you're goin' to do this, I am not letting you do this without me."
- ! '"I thought we weren''t tellin'' anyone about this."'
- ! '"I didn''t tell her, she followed me.'
- And she won't leave, so just do it."
- ! '"I''m so getting fired for this."'
- ! '"If Dr.'
- Caroline says the jumping is unsafe, why are you lettin' her do this?"
- ! '"Your daughter is not an easy person to say no to."'
- Martha continued, "…and I think Dr.
- ! 'So, losing my job over saving the universe: it''s worth it."'
- ! '"Ready Rose?"'
- ! '"Always."'
- ! '"Launching in three…two…one…" A burst of light, and Rose was gone.'
- Finally Martha spoke, "You're not going—I mean…will you—"
- ! '"I won''t tell my husband about this Martha, if that''s what you''re askin''.'
- ! '"Good…thank you."'
- ! '"But if anything happens to her, anything at all…I won''t hesitate to do whatever
  it takes to help her, even if that means tellin'' Pete the truth…understood?"'
- ! '"Yeah, got it."'
- ! '"Good.'
- I'll see myself out then."
- ! '"Mickey, ''s me…yeah, she''s gone.'
- Be here in ten minutes!"
- I do take credit for my version of what happens during Rose's Time away from The
  Doctor in the parallel universe and any original characters she meets there, such
  as Richard "Roady" Colbert, Mitch Wilkinson, and Dr.
- ! '"Can anyone hear me?'
- Is there anyone there?"
- ! '"I knew that voice…" It sounded like…'
- ! '"Harriet, it''s me!"'
- ! '"It''s me!'
- Oh, she can't hear me, have you got a webcam?"
- ! '"No, she wouldn''t let me," Donna''s grandfather, Wilf, answered.'
- ! '"She said they''re naughty."'
- ! '"Well, I can''t speak to her then, can I?"'
- ! '"The fourth contact seems to be having trouble getting through."'
- ! '"That''s me!'
- Harriet, that's me!"
- ! '"I''ll just boost the signal."'
- ! '"Hello?"'
- ! '"Martha Jones!"'
- ! '"Who''s she?'
- I wanna get through!"
- Harriet continued, "I thought it was about time we all met.
- Torchwood, meet Sarah Jane Smith…and Martha Jones, former companion to The Doctor."
- ! '"Oi, so was I!'
- ! '"The Doctor''s got my phone on the TARDIS, but I can''t get through."'
- ! '"Nor me, and I was here first."'
- ! '"C''mon you two!"'
- ! '"If you want to find Donna, then help me!"'
- ! '"She''s right, Sylvia."'
- ! '"Find me, Doctor."'
- ! '"Find me."'
- ! '"Where the hell have you been!?"'
- ! '"Doctor, it''s the Daleks."'
- ! '"It''s the Daleks!"'
- ! '"It''s the Daleks—"'
- ! '"Daleks are everywhere—"'
- ! '"They''re still alive; it''s not just Dalek Caan."'
- ! '"Sarah Jane, who''s that boy?'
- Look at you all, you clever people."
- ! '"That''s Martha," Donna pointed out.'
- ! '"an who''s…he?"'
- ! '"Captain Jack," The Doctor answered.'
- ! '"Don''t, just…don''t."'
- ! '"Doctor, it''s me."'
- ! '"I came back."'
- ! '"It''s like a…outer space-Facebook."'
- ! '"Everyone except Rose."'
- ! '"Then as soon as he appeared, he was gone.'
- ! '"Right," she told Donna''s family.'
- ! '"''M gonna find ''em.'
- Wish me luck."
- ! '"Oh, good luck."'
- ! '"Yeah, good luck sweetheart!"'
