<h2>Chapter 1. Sonic…</h2>

<p>Cream went into the girls bathroom (tails is gone and this is off camera BTW) and saw Rarity washing her mouth out in the sink and at the same time, trying to clean off a stain on her dress.</p>

<p>The six of them headed out and Tails turned on the radar. Unknowing to her, Amy switch Pinkie&#39;s cupcake which rainbow ordered with her cupcake. Zatch and his friends and Mickey and his friends go after anything with Maleficent. She went in one second and came out the next. Dash demanded. I looked Around, to see a dragon type thing, with different types of wings, different types of horns, a goats beard and different types of legs.</p>

<p>Everyone agreed and left. I want you guys to draw us a picture of your favorite scene of this story. He darted upstairs. I thought that was a stupid idea.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous summer day. Before they could, a blinding green light appeared. We didn&#39;t know what it was till I looked it up and was disturbed….ugh. The biggest attraction, however, is the race of course. When Cadence and Shining Armor, Twilight&#39;s big brother, got married, Shining gave Cadence a locket. She was intrigued to hear about the Emeralds especially.</p>

<p>Everyone got into a circle and Pinkie brought a empty coke bottle. Dash looked at Sonic expecting him to tell her parents the unbelievable story that brought him here. Knuckles is up then Applejack then Tails and Twilight. The game started. When they all landed, they fell in a puff of smoke. Rainbow thought and began to speed up, landing into the forest itself and dodging trees with graceful ease.</p>

<p>Sonic runs to lake and tries to catches it</p>

<p>-meanwhile again-</p>

<p>Shadow was looking at an empty plate. He saw some people waking up. His body was entirely blue, like he was as a hedgehog. she asked.</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. Eggman had been defeated about 3 years ago, on Tails&#39; 13th birthday. Something about her was… off. Calvin jumped in the air and hit the ball. It sounds like mad doctor voice. Sonic&#39;s voice came squeaking out.</p>

<p>The three all cheered as they sent the madman flying away. Kiyo did a face palm. I have to study, I have to know if there are any other alternate worlds, other that the mirror one.</p>

<p>After all the animals had been checked and found NOT to be traumatised by Fluttershy, the four of them set off to Sugarcube Corner to make sure everything was alright. They&#39;re good guys. This is not working!</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. It was a purple emerald. And by probably, Tails meant there was only a 67% chance they were actually going to make it.</p>

<p>They followed the waiter. BTW, on 2 things. That is why I am afraid!</p>

<p>&quot;Ok this whole mess started this afternoon&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Rouge,&quot; said Sonia.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you not know who I am?</p>

<p>&quot;Get…off of me…can&#39;t…breath!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p>And-they-can-walk-and-oh-my-I-must-get-some-food-t hey-must-be-hungry-wow-I-cannot-believe i-&quot; &quot;Flutter!</p>

<p>&quot;Nuh-uh!</p>

<p>&quot;You are in Equestria, a place where earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi live in peace&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic moved. Right now, I am in cream&#39;s mom&#39;s car on the way to school. Applejack said, and got into a sprinting pose.</p>

<p>&quot;Is Applejack alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So the last emerald went to…&quot; Everyone turned Calvin.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, new people!</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t really sing warmly… that well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; &quot;To be honest…it looks like a…fox.&quot;</p>

<p>No just sleepy mmm what if why how…&quot; The dazed and slightly insane Sonic dropped on the grass and began snoring his head off, with Knuckles literally bawling with laughter right beside him.</p>

<p>&quot;Guys!</p>

<p>It would never have worked if I hadn&#39;t found a certain blue hair that must have brushed off on me when I fell back in the teleportation machine, thanks to Rarity&#39;s decisive eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NO RAINBOW DON&#39;T!</p>

<p>After Tails and Sonic&#39;s private quarrel, and Fluttershy&#39;s feeding of animals, they decided to head back to Twilights library and discuss sleeping plans. He turned around. Sonic had seen enough of it to remember that it was shaped like a six point star, which was his family crest, basically. Twilight was picking at her fingers, which means she was a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>Amy returned Pinkies little jig with an even bigger frown. Susie asked. GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTORS!</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. WE GOT A PROBLEM!</p>

<p>Twilight sat in her library, watching the events on camera, and wondering how many views this could rack up on PonyTube. Everyone laughed. Each fanfic writers always changes something here and there, it what give fics a little extra kick in quality. He said. huh sounds interesting..</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. Amanda took the trophy and dumped all the money onto Unknown.</p>

<p>Knuckles grabbed Applejack and put her in his arms while he glided down to safety. Mario asked. Robotnik gave me, I changed its programming. They took seats next to their friends. Her mane and tail were straight and had a highlight the color of her fur while the rest was violet.</p>

<p>Thank goodness I found you, you&#39;re not going to believe this, the entire TOWN is inhabited by-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, are those more mamodos?</p>

<p>She screamed, &quot;AAAHHHHHH!&quot;</p>

<p>Jessie laughed, &quot;And James and I will send out our Pokémon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well sure we can talk, you seem to be able to, not trying to be rude though&quot; Aura replied</p>

<p>&quot;Shadow,&quot; Sonic says &quot;Dose THAT look like a machine to you?&quot;</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. He yelled. Roxas and Sora roared in fear. Spike ran and kissed Rarity&#39;s hoof. He was nothing compared to the great and mighty Trixie!</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. Robotnik gave me, I changed its programming. And you are currently the fastest thing there is. After what seemed to be like hours, they were both wore out and was laying on the grass next to each other, starring at the stars.</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. She had no clue where she was. He was a white Unicorn with sky blue hair and tail. Nichimon shook her head at me. They spun around and faced the audience.</p>

<p>Tails moaned. Dash said with surprise. Eggman hovering and spying on his enemies. Right after he said that, rainbow haired cyan blue pony awoken.</p>

<p>Jet thought about this for a little while. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. True, the emeralds had been drained of their power but they had never seen a dent in one of them.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. Sonic looked behind him and there was that monster sized contraption of military insanity he already saw twice now. Jet said in his screechy voice.</p>

<p>Sonic spin-dashed him to the ground, and Vector could feel the heat off his face. Twilight went through that mirror once to get her tiara back from Sunset Shimmer, who came from beyond the mirror to take it for herself. Wait, how did you get here Mokuba?</p>

<p>Rainbow went to the food stand to grab some snacks. She had long and black horns on her head. It was surrounded by wires, panels, nuts and bolts and assorted other things. His eyes were green, and he must&#39;ve hit the wall very hard because Dash could see stars.</p>

<p>The night quickly came and everyone arrived. We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. Calvin and Ash walked on over to Shadow. Due to her lack of muscles, Amy struggled to keep everything from hitting the ground (there were shopping carts, but Amy didn&#39;t notice them XD)</p>

<p>Sonic got back to Tails&#39; house where he and Knuckles were waiting for him. Rarity? Knuckles grunted as he knocked 10 to 15 apples into a basket he had strapped onto his back. I got everything down. Twilight breathed heavily. (sorry if that sounded crappy, was playing LoZ)</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. I&#39;m more than capable of making a robot this simple</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic had stopped directly in the centre of Ponyville after a mad race through Equestria trying to lose Amy. Mario ran out the door and saw a red glow. Tails walked over to the kitchen sink, and opened the fridge next to it. she asked. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>Sonic didn&#39;t really have a good place to stay, and now that he was a pony the tree was out of the question. Twilight said inquisitively. Inside of it was a man. No, he was NOT trying to pretend he was in Minecraft, he was helping out Applejack with her apples as it was apple bucking season and seeing as, well, echidnas aren&#39;t the best buckers in the world, Knuckles was doing what he loved best and was punching trees for his life.</p>

<p>Like…something&#39;s going to happen but you don&#39;t know what it is?&quot;</p>

<p>Mama me a, it&#39;s bright,&quot; Falgore said.</p>

<p>Nice to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok!</p>

<p>&quot;Ok now what?&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think you can cause some of his fantasy enemies come to life?&quot;</p>

<p>-back with sonic and rainbow-</p>

<p>Mrs. Knuckles said.</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. She started to sob with tears streaming down her light blue face. James said. Sonic heard from Silver that he and Trixie came back to town. She got a bit closer to the vent of the Janitor&#39;s closet.</p>

<p>&quot;RUN!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright…&quot; Scootaloo put on her helmet hopped on her scooter, and kicked herself forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Like they are your brother and sister,&quot; Mickey said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok now what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Sonic!&quot;</p>

<p>Like before, there was a red flash and what looked like an explosion in the sky. She was beautiful, but her beauty was ruined by her green skin. Damn unicorn magic is sore as hell!</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. Now he&#39;s evil again. But….</p>

<p>Jet shifted uncomfortably in his seat. And they went skyrocketing again and fell down like before. Sora and Roxas asked. This is confusing!</p>

<p>Sonic jumped over the crowd and started to run. Mickey kept on thinking about the dream. Before they could, a blinding green light appeared. By the way, Shadow is coming for a visit in a few.</p>

<p>Can you please make me some of that calming herbal tea, so I can focus? Luigi asked. With cyan blue skin/fur, a lighting butt tattoo, and wings. Fluttershy squeaks. We don&#39;t even have a robot to work on! Ciao!</p>

<p>The Egg Mecha quickly grabbed Sonic before he could get away. Roxas asked. We have somewhat similar writing styles, except she adds humor to hers. all rights goes to their respective owners!</p>

<p>Vector let out a cry and a shout. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. Then Sonic felt it. Rarity said. Jet aid disappointedly.</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. Normally when the Pinkie sense did this, Rainbow was going to start a sonic rainboom, otherwise it meant a storm was about to stop leaving a rainbow behind. Sonic kept on walking until he was 1 foot from her. Eggman hovering and spying on his enemies. Amy, can&#39;t you stand up for yourself?</p>

<p>She gave a small squeal of fright. Pretty soon Sweetie could sing the Melody, but it&#39;d still be hard to sing the song without backup, which is as good as you can get.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dr.</p>

<p>&quot;Amy&#39;s a bit of a nutter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Vector.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing YOU were randomly teleported here too?&quot;</p>

<p>Done and done! Her name was Cream the Rabbit. Lead the way.</p>

<p>They both did as told, and they both had the same question in mind</p>

<p>Rouge maneuvers the fly to door and tries to find a crack in the wall or door. This is a big moment for the two of you!</p>

<p>Knuckles and Rouge was at the door in a new look and Amy didn&#39;t notice them. Secretly though. That&#39;s when we first met!</p>

<p>She said that if her parents approved then Sonic could stay at her place until it was no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Yo Sonic, want to race?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s just get to the point,&quot; Mewoth said.</p>

<p>&quot;Only you&#39;re a human.&quot;</p>

<p>Tails meet some new friends of mine that I just met, this here fox is Max who appears to have twin tails just like you and almost has your voice but deeper&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can call me, Tailspin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>Those stupid Keepers can&#39;t beat me now,&quot; Maleficent said.</p>

<p>&quot;GO!&quot;</p>

<p>She screamed and ran along a dusty cobbled road, and took a sharp turn to the left to find herself in front of a massive tree that looked almost like a house.</p>

<p>Tails bounced around a bit. Tails said. Originally Vector was going to check and see if there was any note they had missed saying where they had gone or what they were going to do, but Cream had begged to come along as there really was nothing to do without any of her friends around. Dash grabbed her friend and flew on over to Sonic and the others. Tails leapt out of his fur as Amy screamed at the mention of Sonic. It will probably just be a…..</p>

<p>Knuckles pulled out the phone that Rouge gave him and played the noises Rouge, which was with Amy and Pinkie was in the closet. &#39;Ah man. Rouge says. Sonic was speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See, I win the bet…&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You landed here too!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mom said we need to get along and have more responsibilities.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, and he&#39;s bent on causing trouble too.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow went home after Flutter&#39;s concert, which ended great. The two boys darted to the blue hedgehog. I bet that is a shortcut! Here!</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Trixie ordered room service. they yelled. He saw some people waking up. The 5 seconds she entered in the portal, it closed. He flipped two burger patties onto two hamburger buns. I&#39;ll take it!</p>

<p>As soon as the waiter left, Tails felt something poke his leg. Keio said. He said. Applebloom says. Everyone did as she said this time. In order to get my friendship back, you need to be my slave for tonight</p>

<p>Racing day is tomorrow and Amanda wants to be in it, but have no partner. You and your friends are mutant animals, which makes sense why you&#39;re talking. C&#39;mon Shads! The new formed friends looked at her with fear. That was where Rainbow had to say something.</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Told us what?</h2>

<p>(If you know where I got the Name of the OC here, please tell me.</p>

<p>&quot;Before we warped I quickly grabbed it and stuffed it in my quills&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, what happened to you guys?&quot;</p>

<p>Back in Ponyville</p>

<p>Rarity was left there with a big smile on her face. He asked, looking innocent. Anyway, you two want something to eat? There was plush chairs and a Television and even some grape soda. It was more…lighter. I&#39;M GOOD!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Twilight was over at Sugarcube Corner with Pinkie. Anyways, I guess you&#39;re right…we do need a new member…we have hardly any money. Mickey couldn&#39;t stop thinking about. Shadow commented.</p>

<p>&quot;IT BRUNS!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t mention it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well lets just get out of here&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Calm down Twilight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. I&#39;ve been working a stove for like 2 years now. Where do you come from? Just great. What happened?</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow came home after they did a big portion of the project at Tails&#39; place. Maybe Fluttershy heard something from Silver&#39;s Telepathic wish, her eyes started to open, and the first thing she saw was Silver. She ended with a perfect split and back up to her feet again. His eyes were green, and he must&#39;ve hit the wall very hard because Dash could see stars.</p>

<p>Blade walks on stage and he takes a breath. As did the other Spirits of Harmony.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...</p>

<p>Rainbow helped sonic of the rainbow and the two returned to the Dorm. I don&#39;t know where you came from. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!? Peach questions. From what I knew, no one was awake when we were teleported. Do you like rainbow dash?</p>

<p>I am requesting that you gather your friends and come to Canterlot immediately, I do not know if the situation is an emergency, but you must come here right now, there are these two creatures that seem to be hedgehogs, they just came out of nowhere and crashed into the throne room, I wonder if Fluttershy will be able to calm them down if they get out of control. That and they want a break. Good news is, he still alive. Just then, it glowed. Hobbes was reading a comic book. Amy answered it and it was Shadow.</p>

<p>Rainbow and Fluttershy walked meekly (well Fluttershy did anyways) into the forest. The pony looked up to see a blue hedgehog, with gloves and shoes, emerald eyes, and a Do-You-Want-To-Go-On-A-Adventure look. If I pass out, I want you to take my body and RUN LIKE HELL!</p>

<p>After the explosion occurred, 3 eyewitnesses with very good eyesight saw 4 &quot;objects&quot; fall from the sky.</p>

<p>Shadow was looking at an empty plate. Dawn asked. Knuckles said.</p>

<p>Sonic went back to his place to see rainbow passed out peacefully on the couch. ;D</p>

<p>&quot;Calvin?</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;ll probably be a while though.</p>

<p>&quot;Not surprising,&quot; Said another female voice.</p>

<p>Eggman looked up and noticed that Aura was about slice his robot in half, without hesitation the evil madman left the &quot;Egg Mecha Warrior&quot; as it was barely sliced and exploded sending him flying.</p>

<p>&quot;So these Chaos Emeralds are good and bad news depending on the user?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the same world with the Stonecutter&#39;s Quill.&quot;</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles fought over the driving wheel and result in them crashing into the wall, destroying their kart. Ash then asked. It was Maleficent. He immediately noticed it, as it looked oddly like a Chaos Emerald…wait…it WAS a Chaos Emerald! Amy ignored the chocolaty delight and barged straight up to the counter.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. Megumi squealed. Right then four were glowing very brightly, but the other three were still dim.</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie was at the foot of Mt. Pretty amethysts eyes, and a star on her flank. It was Twilight poking him with her toe. Ms. They called it the Summer Beach Bash to celebrate the 1st day of summer.</p>

<p>It was Monday and the students had the day off. Great!</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Twilights library, Tails and Twilight were talking so fast that one might have mistaken them to be speaking another language.</p>

<p>Intrigued, she stepped back a little to see the screen a little better. Both of them covered their ears</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t realize it until it was over, but a crowd had formed outside of the clubhouse. Dash opened and straightens her wings. Really?</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That thermometer was one time thing and you know it…&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guys!</p>

<p>Sonic smiles and gets up letting out a chuckle readying himself for a good smack down, as the allies get ready Eggman was up and furious to see his chance of ending the annoying hedgehog slip away. Except Shadow, he&#39;s a bit emo and doesn&#39;t see her with fear or alarm. This world needs Sonic on the other side of that mirror for now. Hobbes asked. XD</p>

<p>Then the mice from Mario&#39;s room stormed in Sonic&#39;s room. Mr. He couldn&#39;t come up with one on his own so easily. Mickey pulled out his paintbrush. We raced around the block, we arm wrestled, we played Mario Kart Wii and Super Smash Bros Brawl and I beat you in everything.</p>

<p>The girl that found him, Dash, looked at him with intrigue from the corner of her eyes. 2 preteens and adult that looks his eyes are just his eyebrows. Keio said. You&#39;re just paranoid.</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. OH! Rainbow was on the couch watching wipe-out, bored out of her mind. But he knew what she was talking about. I&#39;m just staying here for tonight then it&#39;s back out for me.</p>

<p>Then he realized what it was. Applejack almost pinned down Knuckles&#39; arm to the wooden surface of the table. And Calvin was chewing on chocolate chip cookies. Just then, it glowed. Rarity yelled. But I just want to have a talk with you.</p>

<p>There was somepony in front of him. Amy almost shouted as squealed and ran back and forth to try and bake the sugary delight.</p>

<p>&quot;I love early morning cartoons.</p>

<p>&quot;So uh…what do you do around here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tails?</p>

<p>Tails jumped at Twilight&#39;s sudden appearance</p>

<p>The bell ringed and everyone put their robots in the storage room. Eggman at his failed attempt to ambush Sonic, after his defeat Sonic invited his two new friends to join him on his trip to his childhood friend&#39;s workshop.</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. He noticed that his fur was all over the place. Rarity? Especially with his avatar&#39;s Transformation into a human. At the mention of her name Pinkie shot up.</p>

<p>Both girls pushed their opponent&#39;s hand with all of their strength. A filmier figure is what they say. And by probably, Tails meant there was only a 67% chance they were actually going to make it.</p>

<p>Cream and Vector had headed for Sonic and Tails&#39; house. When I saw it, I spat out my tea. Although when they arrived at the lush green pastureland that was outside Tails&#39; house, there was an edge of uncertainty they couldn&#39;t put their finger on.</p>

<p>And you can boss Storm around,</p>

<p>Everyone cheers again</p>

<p>Jet answered the door as the doorbell rung. Before Discord could get away, Nichimon used her part of the Elements of Harmony; The Element of Darkness. But from some odd reason, dimensional traveling caused him to be seen the way Calvin sees him. His expression was hard and cold as ever. Come on, I dare you) &#39;She&#39;s lying. You&#39;re blinding yourself!</p>

<p>Twilight ran to the bathroom to splash some water on her face. Mickey asked. She went up and laughed to see Tails surrounded by 20 to 30 books, and was casually picking up 2 of them at once and reading them at the exact same time. I own nothing (BTW if you read the Shadow! Then, the ponies saw something from it. Cream said weakly, half laughing, half in tears at her demise which was soon to come.</p>

<p>Can you get it?&quot;</p>

<p>And made up with only staple parts too!&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You…&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The two birds rushed around outside the lounge, getting the stuff ready for whatever Jet had in mind. Now we need a tie breaker!</p>

<p>Both of them were drinking a barrel full of Coke-Cola and applejack came out victorious.</p>

<p>Mrs. People were seriously getting down. AJXKNUX. He darted upstairs. We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. Let&#39;s win this</p>

<p>Sonic stormed to Mario&#39;s door and banged on it. Amy, can&#39;t you stand up for yourself?</p>

<p>He looked at a mirror the next chance he got. Mickey said to Rainbow Dash. AARON! Spike and Twilight chuckled at the fox&#39;s innocent ways. Sora and Oswald asked. After school, drop by my place.</p>

<p>sonic was standing by the food stand, eating a chili dog. She gasped. Rainbow asked. She talked pretty fast. said Twilight. Afterwards, she calm down and played her WIIU</p>

<p>Applebloom and Babs does so and they hopped on. Maybe he needed to wash. Tails walked out in a black tuxedo and a white undershirt and a black bow-tie. She was just as scary to look at as before when she tried to pass herself off as Cadence and marry Shining, but she didn&#39;t feel at all as evil as then. I was reading this flyer and…</p>

<p>The traffic light turned green and all the drivers (plus Applebloom she&#39;s in charge of the gas pedal) slammed down their gas pedals. He said. I&#39;m the only one she trust and loves.</p>

<p>I have nothing to say except well, thanks for reading! Mickey thought. She suddenly couldn&#39;t move, but whoever it was whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>Rouge was secretly following Amy with her phone in her hand. &#39;I seen that emerald thing from my dream last night!&#39; Twilight asked as she helped him up. They&#39;re eyes shrunk. But I have nothing!</p>

<p>Flutter gave Twilight a ride to the Madison Le Cruset because she didn&#39;t have a car. He placed a cup on the table and walked off looking pissed off. &#39;Mario!&#39; Pinkie asked. Now, the suit!</p>

<p>Everyone went to their homes to get some rest to start the Chaos Emerald Search tomorrow, Aura followed Applejack to her families apple farm and Sonic followed Rainbow Dash to her cloud home at an incredible speed. Rainbow dash and Sonic</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. For now, let&#39;s go!</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow put their stuff in the room pinkie gave them. Hobbes asked. Here! He placed his hand on his head. Including Cadence. I handed him the scroll, urging him to read it.</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. Not eating?</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver was climbing mount Silver and the two was half way there. They can feel each other shaking in anticipation and in nervousness. Sonic is..</p>

<p>And now that you mention it, I do feel kind of weird today, I was wondering if you-&quot; Rainbow Dash was interrupted by a certain Twilight Sparkle who came rushing over to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Cool,&quot; Ash said.</p>

<p>&quot;Where&#39;s Sonic?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; I don&#39;t think now&#39;s the time to start chatting Aura&quot; the fox responded while giving him a serious look</p>

<p>The night of the Talent Show came around, and Sonic was watching from backstage as the other performers went one by one, eventually getting to Pinkie Pie and the other girls who very much resembled the Spirits of Harmony. Sonic asked. they said. Dash saw it too, and it obviously scared her. Calvin said. I hope you&#39;re as excited as me about this once-in-a-year derby</p>

<p>The three all cheered as they sent the madman flying away. Pinkie&#39;s tail started to twitch. She accidently crashes the spy fly into the wall. Sora nodded and walked away. Rainbow took off to the sky with a whoosh of her wings.</p>

<p>Rainbow Dash trotted over to Twilight&#39;s house. The two ponies and the fox had worked out their differences and now it seemed as if Tails and Twilight had more in common then the eye meets. Plus, not everyone at the age of 18 go to college, they can go whenever they want (or at least that&#39;s how my state runs I think). Sonic said awkwardly. what the...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Vector did not know that Tails had installed mini-turrets to go off if a biological being went through the window. Not the best, but still good</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. Probably will submit the next one today. Or maybe that was his Equestrian Avatar, because it was a blue colt with a red tail with a white stripe halfway between the tip and his flank. Spike and Twilight chuckled at the fox&#39;s innocent ways. He placed his hand in the cool water and pulled out a red gem that was glowing rapidly bright you swear it be Rudolph&#39;s nose. Rainbow asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Mario,&quot; Peach said.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Sonic, thank God we were able to stop that insane over killing machine.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess you aren&#39;t from here?&quot;</p>

<p>Get up!&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic started humming a song that he really liked, he heard it on one of his adventures. I&#39;M SO SORRY! WE LOVE YOU! I&#39;m your principle and your host, Celestia. Everyone applauses. Twilight said cautiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. As Sonic opened his eyes agonizingly, he realized that he was sitting on top of a tree. Whoa! then she looked at him. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a portal opened. It was a gem with a music note inside, and a heart covered microphone bursting out of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Twilight!&quot;</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. Rainbow Dash turned around and saw one of her friends, Twilight Sparkle. the two kids asked. Spike walked over and opened the door. GIVE ME THE WHEEL!</p>

<p>Sonic and Tails were stunned. She got a good balanced pose to keep herself from falling out of the vent and opened her phone to the voice recorder app. the older one yelled. Zatch asked. I have cake in my eyes! He said that something unimaginable was just behind the mirror, and still sent Sonic to that world under Queen Chrysalis&#39; advice.</p>

<p>Sonic quickly rushed over to the door and pulled Rainbow to the hallway</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. Mario and Luigi were on the left side. Yeah it would&#39;ve been weird enough with the two tails that mutated onto him at birth, but they were still there, just as bushy as a fox. She pulled out a cyan blue jewel. Tails and Cream clapped.</p>

<p>&quot;The Black Phoenix will reach the Mirror in two days.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. That&#39;s weird</h2>

<p>Hello, Hola, Bonjour and what-not!</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, they were at the park. He didn&#39;t know where he was until he heard a familiar voice talk to him.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an abrupt oven door to the head. She started to sob with tears streaming down her light blue face. She was startled to see Jet appear on the screen with…a guitar? He may break up with me, or never talk to me again or…..</p>

<p>By the way guys. He looked at the ring, and saw that the yellow emerald was glowing brighter. Sweetie Belle asked. Tell me!</p>

<p>There was a knocking at the door. He could feel it, he felt…the magic of friendship. A portal, well six portals to be exact. She wore a black and purple robe. Cream started to unknot the tails of Tails. Sonic saw Trixie and Unknown in the ring of Pokémon fans, talking about the Gameboy games.</p>

<p>-Meanwhile, NOT in Twilight Sparkle&#39;s thoughts…-</p>

<p>Sonic, Tails and Pinkie walked over to the Carousel Boutique and Sonic opened the door. Knuckles was introduced to Twilight, and even though Knuckles was still laughing over the Sonic incident, he managed to talk to Tails with a straight face.</p>

<p>Little did the hedgehog know he was being followed by a madman waiting to ambush his speedy foe. Not much, actually. And by that I mean he charged at Metal, who just raised his hoof and punched him into the mirror behind him. He smiled at Twilight.</p>

<p>Fluttershy ran over and almost keeled over when she noticed a fox and two hedgehogs as big as she was. He started to rub his arms. Look.</p>

<p>Cream was stuck with Vector and Espio. Thanks. He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. Remember last time you got on stage alone?</p>

<p>Before the seven of them knew what on earth the thing was, it stared to suck all of them in. WE LOVE YOU! Sonic asked. As for the other figure, it was a Dark Red hedgehog with all quills pointing up, dark blue eyes, wearing a black shirt with a white sleeveless hoodie on top, black pants, black converse (having the same function as Sonic&#39;s shoes), and white fingerless gloves.</p>

<p>Everyone got into a circle and Pinkie brought a empty coke bottle. Spike and Rarity says. Rarity said. Sonic is..</p>

<p>And…&quot;</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. Spiky? Rouge says. I should be doing homework. Hello Twilight! Tails said.</p>

<p>The race is almost underway and the interviews are over. a gold ring at the base, and the design of a blue stem that lead to a ring of the same color. he was disgusted at what he saw. Anyway, I think I have figured it out. So much books to read and so much time! I….</p>

<p>Amy sighed. The CMCs did the same. Tia and Zatch asked. Dash demanded. They walked away chowing down on their meal. All eyes were focused to the window nearest to the counter, and all the ponies gasped.</p>

<p>Cream waited patiently and her mind was about to wander off into dreaming when a rope ladder was dropped down and Wave slid smoothly down the ladder. He flipped two burger patties onto two hamburger buns. We are going to try and combine all of them together.</p>

<p>The ignition of a very large motor engine (gotcha, didn&#39;t I?). And two, they are in the kitchen). Tails said. I don&#39;t want it to happen again!</p>

<p>Rainbow went into the bathroom and brought out a mini flashlight. Mickey thought. Where the heck was he? After the &#39;Pinkie Cannon thing&#39;, everyone started to party. Said a low, loud voice. She had very lightly colorful mane and an image of the sun was on her flank.</p>

<p>Is it me, you say, you&#39;re looking forLet me show you who I am and what I have in store... She then gasped. Sonic walked 5 feet close to where the sand fell. I&#39;m Amy. You focus on the road, leave the enemies to me</p>

<p>Now obviously, he never brought his cellphone while running as it could slip out of his hands quite easily (where else could he put it?) but he had to today, as Tails would have no way of contacting him unless he did. Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Oswald, Roxas, and Sora started to run by was sucked in along with they&#39;re keyblades, paintbrush, and the gem. Twilight took this small bag. Amy and Pinkie simply screamed at the incoming bomb. I bet that is a shortcut! all rights goes to their respective owners!</p>

<p>Sonic went back to his place to see rainbow passed out peacefully on the couch. He yelled. I looked out my window. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. Sonic asked. We need to heal anyway!</p>

<p>We also have to find out a way to build a portal back home, even if it does take a few years…&quot; Tails started.</p>

<p>&quot;You look different.&quot;</p>

<p>Mom wants me to,&#39; Calvin thought but said, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s Team Rocket!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me?</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;</p>

<p>The 6 ponies left Spike behind to look up in the library what could have been a possible cause of a random explosion in the sky, while they ran off to try find the cause of the explosion by asking other ponies. The new formed friends looked at her with fear. Just then, beings came falling down from them. Until he gets better, I will take over the story ~mb6</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. Amanda and (newcomer) Blade were just walking do the halls, talking.</p>

<p>I have nothing to say except well, thanks for reading! Oswald said as he shock Mickey. Mickey yelled as he sat up. Trixie looked at Silver and grinned.</p>

<p>Tails took one look at Vector and sighed. Rainbow asked. I stole one of Tails&#39; mechs and thanks to the extra help dr. He walked upstairs, feeling quite confident that the machine would work, but even though the odds were in their favour for the machine to work (at a 67% chance no doubt) Tails felt a twinge of nervousness. Celestia answered him with a suspicious look</p>

<p>Knuckles, who had been lazing around for most of the day, was woken by a moaning Appljeack. Spike and Rarity says. Besides, we have to wait for the rest of them to get here. He turned around to see a portal opened. All he did was laugh. IN SECOND PLACE!</p>

<p>The bell ringed and everyone put their robots in the storage room. Dust from the track flew into the air and the racers took off, except Pinkie and Amy, who had a burnout. It glowed rapidly. But it was too late. Good news is, he still alive. I&#39;M GOING AS FAST AS THIS KART CAN GO!</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Trixie ordered room service. Sonic heard from Silver that he and Trixie came back to town. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. all rights goes to their respective owners!</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. Zero. People were seriously getting down. Wait, she won&#39;t make it in time. Peach questions. Still no sign of Amanda nor Unknown, most likely, still traveling though the shortcut.</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. Sonic asked with a smirk. The judges for tonight are myself, Luna and my niece Candence.</p>

<p>While Tails and Twilight were setting off to check on the supposed Chaos Emerald, Knuckles was out on Sweet Apple Acres, punching trees. Bowser looked dumb folded. We arrived in Everfree Forest, seeing different creatures, one with a green gem clutched to his fluffy chest. He flipped two burger patties onto two hamburger buns. I have a line of plot in my head that I&#39;m going to be following along, and if it goes as I like it then I MIGHT include some OC&#39;s, not for the moment however.</p>

<p>The audience started clapping to the beat.</p>

<p>Sonic woke up on the roof of a building. Then emeralds stop glowing. One of them completely opened his eyes. I&#39;m trying to fix it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m faster than Sonic, the idiot!</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. Rainbow hid her face in embarrassment and Sonic banged his head on the nearest wall.</p>

<p>He froze to his chair, his fur straight up. The creatures and Discord looked over at us. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and the Cutie Mark Crusaders followed with they&#39;re settle bags on their backs. And she smiled at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Applejack, you are sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Cream sighed as she decide to keep working on here sand castle.</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. The rest of Sonic&#39;s friends family came rushing to the hedgehog and fox. Or maybe he becomes a super genius? Actually, Shad is in the audience spying on Luna XD</p>

<p>College is tough these days and sonic and rainbow knows firsthand. Tails said, getting up off the floor. then she looked at him. Applebloom says. He placed his hand on his head. THEY ABANDON YOU?!</p>

<p>Sonic was attending central middle school and got news that a new girl was transferring to his home room from Cloudsdale. he exclaimed. Tails said, chuckling.</p>

<p>Whenever my tail twitches, something is going to fall!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shadow...</p>

<p>There is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know as well I do I suck at riding anything.&quot;</p>

<p>SRS CHAPTER IS SRS! Right after he said that, he saw a spark in the corner of his eye. She was whispering something to Pinkie, so quietly not even I could hear. He asked. Oswald gave Mickey a noggin. She sighed and put the box down and banged on the wall near the couch to wake up sonic.</p>

<p>Twilight began reading the letter from her beloved ruler and mentor, it said</p>

<p>Just as he was drenching them in maple syrup, Knuckles and Amy wandered through the door. A filmier figure is what they say. Twilight scolded. Sonic questioned. You ready?</p>

<p>&quot;I know right,&quot; Ash says.</p>

<p>Come on out!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good Idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic had gone on his run and had run all the way across a hilly vale, feeling the wind brush his face and neck. Sonic said waving to his Mobian friends. EAH! Applejack thought. After school, drop by my place.</p>

<p>He froze to his chair, his fur straight up. He ran towards it. So Tails gave him the directions and Knuckles was off.</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. Both of us are flat broke!</p>

<p>&quot;Aura Blade!&quot;</p>

<p>I should see what the little fur ball has been up to&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic Impact.&quot;</p>

<p>They followed the waiter. The small boy with golden hair and was with that older kid is Zatch and Keio. I brought disguises for us to wear. He sighed to himself. I got busy at home with back-to-school shopping, clothes, etc.</p>

<p>She does so and both of them zoomed off, screaming as Pinkie tries to take back control</p>

<p>Sonic noticed the two of them and silently awwwed in his mind. Probably will submit the next one today. In 30 seconds flat he was done and he and Susie walked on over to the Mario Brothers. she says. When we get near it, both of you jump back here with me!</p>

<p>10 minutes/5 rounds later, Calvin and Susie won volleyball. She cursed the portal for giving her bad eyesight.</p>

<p>Sonic didn&#39;t really have a good place to stay, and now that he was a pony the tree was out of the question. Sonic smirked. She didn&#39;t question it, however, in her mind a devious plan formed to find out what Tails did while on chocolate…</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Fluttershy covered her face. I&#39;ve been working a stove for like 2 years now. he asked. Discord stuttered. What was that hedgehog at now?</p>

<p>Sonic ended up getting help from one person he did not expect.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. Fluttershy said in a sort of mumble. The CMCs did the same. Spike and Rarity says. Can you PM me your story?</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. Celestia, Luna and Candence were the judges. The emerald flew to the center of a circle of the other Chaos Emeralds. Twilight went through that mirror once to get her tiara back from Sunset Shimmer, who came from beyond the mirror to take it for herself. Sonic! What happened?</p>

<p>-Lunchroom-</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, so that means…&quot;</p>

<p>They don&#39;t bite,&quot; Rainbow says.</p>

<p>Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well sure we can talk, you seem to be able to, not trying to be rude though&quot; Aura replied</p>

<p>This draconequus, where he may be, may his chaos will rain free!&quot;</p>

<p>The weird part was he stopped the truck with his bare hand, causing the truck to go from convex front to concave completely. Later that night, Sonic, Rainbow and Twilight was playing a game of Monopoly. she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, thank Celestia Fluttershy ain&#39;t here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Rouge,&quot; said Sonia.</p>

<p>&quot;So?</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, the genius Knucklehead FINALLY find out!</p>

<p>Both of them held the trophy up. Silver, home to the Pokémon master. He turned around and screamed he saw a portal. We don&#39;t even have a robot to work on! That&#39;s when Rainbow remembered what the Mirror was. Keep up!</p>

<p>So this is what you meantWhen you said that you were spentAnd now it&#39;s time to build from the bottom of the pitRight to the topDon&#39;t hold backPacking my bags and giving the academy a rain check</p>

<p>Rainbow and Fluttershy walked meekly (well Fluttershy did anyways) into the forest. he asked. Mario nodded. REALLY?!</p>

<p>Spike woke me up, by repetitively poking me. Mario eye&#39;s shrunk. he was disgusted at what he saw. Mario yelled. Right after he said that, rainbow haired cyan blue pony awoken.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, you brutes?</p>

<p>Dash felt something pull at her heart that made her follow him. The red substance wasn&#39;t a liquid, or a solid, or even a gas, although it looked a lot like mist.</p>

<p>Rainbow wrote her address on a sheet of paper and hand it to Sonic. She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. With cyan blue skin/fur, a lighting butt tattoo, and wings. She yelped. Am I late?</p>

<p>I got it!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Team Rocket blast off at the speed of light!</h2>

<p>Babababababababa, welcome back minions!</p>

<p>Tails and knuckles passed the line into their 4th lap. Max said looking around at all the machineries. replied Twilight</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. Normally when the Pinkie sense did this, Rainbow was going to start a sonic rainboom, otherwise it meant a storm was about to stop leaving a rainbow behind. Sonic stood up, revealing the rest of his body. IT&#39;S MY FAULT THAT YOU TRIED TO PUNCH TWILIGHT IN THE FACE!</p>

<p>Tails and Sonic were just relaxing in Twilight&#39;s kitchen, chatting moderately. I GOT IT! Mario and Luigi yelled. Amy was startled and slopped coffee all down her front. There was a talent show to pump everyone&#39;s spirits up about a week before that. MOMMY!</p>

<p>Two down, one to go, Sonic thought to himself. Rainbow took off to the sky with a whoosh of her wings.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m also back from the hospital. But by the look of the beach, it wasn&#39;t her home. Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Calvin, Hobbes, and Susie can go after whatever Bowser has. I&#39;ll pay</p>

<p>&quot;IT BRUNS!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before we warped I quickly grabbed it and stuffed it in my quills&quot;</p>

<p>sonic was standing by the food stand, eating a chili dog. My wings were annoying the crap out of me today. His Cutie Mark was a glove, like the one Silver the Hedgehog wore. Now, the suit!</p>

<p>&quot;Tails…I&#39;m going to tell you something that you can&#39;t tell ANYONE else, ok?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello&quot; Max greeted putting out his hand.</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. Is it. He told Dash&#39;s parents that his parents died the night before. Look.</p>

<p>&quot;To put it mildly, one of Tails&#39; machines looks like it screwed up and him, Sonic, Knuckles and Amy went missing.</p>

<p>&quot;I going downstairs, you&#39;re coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, don&#39;t break the 4th wall again.</p>

<p>&quot;Pinkie Pie!</p>

<p>&quot;Fl...</p>

<p>Rouge&#39;s eyes widen. Calvin jumped in the air and hit the ball. Dash grabbed her friend and flew on over to Sonic and the others. Blue? Lead the way.</p>

<p>Everything had been set…A completely oblivious Sonic, an even more oblivious Tails, a spiked cup of tea and a conveniently placed video camera in place.</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. Whoa! 30 seconds later, Ash lifted his head off of the golden sand and saw to filmier figures. You&#39;re blinding yourself!</p>

<p>Sonic called Dominos but couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Rainbow. Spike said chuckling.</p>

<p>Both hedgehogs ran out of the infirmary with great speed and came up across a huge door fortunately that wasn&#39;t guarded by anyone until they heard voices coming from a hallway on the right, they quickly ran inside and shut the door behind them the two were relieved that they didn&#39;t get caught until they heard a voice behind them.</p>

<p>Naal ok zin los vahriin</p>

<p>The music ends and everyone applauded the girls for their performance. What was that? Tails let everyone else walk in while he typed in some numbers to a console on the side of the door. Everyone yelled. I&#39;m Amy. replied Twilight</p>

<p>She found herself screaming Sonic&#39;s name. Do you have any golden mushrooms?</p>

<p>After they ate, they went to bed with each other on their minds.</p>

<p>Sonic, rainbow and Twilight was back in their own apartment after the rats have been cleared out. I should mention that indeed the couples actually came to my mind from that fan-fiction. Aura asked out of nowhere</p>

<p>Is it me, you say, you&#39;re looking forLet me show you who I am and what I have in store... Applebloom says. I have an idea and I want to broadcast it ALL over Mobius! Sonic walked in casually.</p>

<p>&quot;Twilight, can you- OMC!&quot;</p>

<p>Tails meet some new friends of mine that I just met, this here fox is Max who appears to have twin tails just like you and almost has your voice but deeper&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh ok then!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think women?&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone got into a circle and Pinkie brought a empty coke bottle. Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Calvin, Hobbes, and Susie can go after whatever Bowser has. You&#39;re not getting this emerald. Sora asked. I&#39;m trying to fix it.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, they were at the park. She wore a black and purple robe. Pinkie? Rainbow had it. She stuck out her hoof and Amy half bro-fisted, half grabbed it and shook.</p>

<p>The crowd clapped their hands and cheered.</p>

<p>Amanda arrived at the school entrance. She had long and black horns on her head. I never realized how soft her skin is. AMY!</p>

<p>Rarity was left there with a big smile on her face. Sonic grinned. Screw that place</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well Tails…the easiest to explain would be the sun rising and setting every day.</p>

<p>&quot;NOOO!</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t working, ok?</p>

<p>Help me,&quot; she screamed in fear.</p>

<p>&quot;I still want control over this land.</p>

<p>&quot;Jeez, Knuckles,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell Sweetie Belle &#39;that was an incredible performance,&#39;&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. Sonic looked behind him and there was that monster sized contraption of military insanity he already saw twice now. He saw his friends. However, Twilight allowed him to sleep in like Spike. His eyes were greener, like emeralds found more commonly in nature, and his skin was like any other human he saw in Spagonia, or Adabat. I handed him the scroll, urging him to read it.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Sonic?&quot;</p>

<p>n-name is...F-fluttershy&quot; Fluttershy said nervously</p>

<p>&quot;EEEYAGGGHHHH!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is so bizarre, it&#39;s glowing extremely bright,&quot; he points out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then we&#39;ll just have a race to see who&#39;s faster&quot;</p>

<p>I am the narrator of this small part of your life. Fluttershy, just remember what I have taught you and you&#39;ll be fine</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles slid into the mud. Rarity asked. Pretty soon Sonic made a replica of Green Hill Zone.</p>

<p>Sonic, Tails and Pinkie walked over to the Carousel Boutique and Sonic opened the door. Applejack came running. Calvin said. I want to show you something outside.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. Here! anyways I&#39;ll get to the part where they will go to the mlp universe ok so I&#39;ll try think of something. Suddenly, his cellphone started to ring.</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. Twilight looked up and saw her friend. People were seriously getting down. Sonic shouted, speeding downstairs to Tails&#39; workshop. You ready, Rainbow?</p>

<p>Cream had to fight to not collapse with laughter. Whoa! Ash said. So much books to read and so much time! Tails screamed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jet was confused at the fact that there were ponies around. Twilight stumbled over the last word. said a female voice. He swept Dash off her feet, and ran as fast as he could.</p>

<p>The two teams started planning to fight. my... This world needs Sonic on the other side of that mirror for now. She had indigo fur and a moon image on her flank. Spiked yelled. -_- anyway, I want to thank everyone for liking this story!</p>

<p>Uh…ok! You and your friends are mutant animals, which makes sense why you&#39;re talking. Want it back?</p>

<p>Dash felt something pull at her heart that made her follow him. Both of them covered their ears</p>

<p>Twilight got out and waited at the door for Tails, while Fluttershy drove off. A boy and girl with a tiger. Dust from the track flew into the air and the racers took off, except Pinkie and Amy, who had a burnout. Silver walked in the middle of the classroom and began to spoke.</p>

<p>Now for that announcement I was talking about. He will reappear. NO!</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie were getting ready for the tie-breaker. You really don&#39;t know by now? Hey, what are you doing?</p>

<p>It took a while, however. Take it easy!</p>

<p>Amy pressed the button and launched the bomb towards Cream and Rouge. Not only that, but it can weaken/dull the villains power. Rainbow told them about the dream.</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. the cat tags on. xD </p>

<p>Just as he was drenching them in maple syrup, Knuckles and Amy wandered through the door. the woman said. Mario said. Rainbow asked.</p>

<p>10 minutes/5 rounds later, Calvin and Susie won volleyball. Pinkie is so nice enough to led us a room I her apartment.</p>

<p>The cry pierced the air as a certain pink hedgehog smashed through the already-open door and hugged Sonic, who fell over in embarrassment. Cream looked up to see Tails. I picked up this banana peel and I thought it would be useful. Unfortunately, the mood was sour.</p>

<p>They switched like you switch in Mario Kart Double Dash. He looked at me, staring at the chaos emerald in my hand. They walked in and went to the counter and took some seats.</p>

<p>Amy pressed the button and launched the bomb towards Cream and Rouge. See you guys later! Before they could, a blinding green light appeared. Where was the locket now?</p>

<p>Rainbow is lead sonic to the front of the complex to show him their project, a miniature replica of Mobius, but it wasn&#39;t done yet. Suddenly, the CMCs was racing down a dirt ramp and as the flew off the ramp, they crossed the finish line. Twilight looked up and saw her friend. Her eyes were watering. One thing first</p>

<p>Sonic ran here as fast as he could</p>

<p>A few hours later, Tails woke up. he yelled with joy. She yelped. Now we need a tie breaker!</p>

<p>&quot;Same way as you guys, I guess.</p>

<p>Are you trying to get us betrayed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Howdy there partner, my name&#39;s Applejack&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah… but how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are we?&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of the cobalt hedgehog, at this very moment he was out for his morning jog, running along a grassy land which was full of cows, pigs and other assorted animals as the morning sun, full of bright energy, crept up on the still-sleeping farm. Shadow asked. Susie asked. Get out from under the table!</p>

<p>Oops! What she wasn&#39;t expecting was Shadow, Silver, or Tails to be back from Mobius.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I think that makes senses, due to their speech.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That didn&#39;t sound like a gunshot,&quot; Manic said.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I know where I came from,&quot; He said in a worried voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Before we warped I quickly grabbed it and stuffed it in my quills&quot;</p>

<p>You really did sing in front of the entire country back home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure!&quot;</p>

<p>A little later Shadow brought Sonic up to speed (No pun intended) on the situation that brought them to Canterlot City. Her name was Cream the Rabbit. Twilight whispered to Tails. What about you? Amy was startled and slopped coffee all down her front. She would have ran if her legs hadn&#39;t been stuck to the ground by an unknown force.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll stick around for more of the story! They were clapping along as wildly as the audience.</p>

<p>College is tough these days and sonic and rainbow knows firsthand. she thought to herself. Sonic questioned. Before we head by to our own places, how about we stop at the Drink Stop? Knuckles would learn his lesson for this stupid remark in front of a unicorn by spending 3 days in hospital with a fractured skull and broken arms.</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. He pulled out a Yellow Tail fish and started to munch down on it. Discord&#39;s eyes flashed green. How did you make it? Rainbow said. As soon as the gem fell in, the portal closed.</p>

<p>Rouge jumped from her spot and kicked the bomb back at Amy and Pinkie. But Shadow did not notice that Sonic was to him. Anyways, Amy wasn&#39;t in the least bit surprised. Mickey said to Rainbow Dash. I don&#39;t cuss</p>

<p>Sonic smiles and gets up letting out a chuckle readying himself for a good smack down, as the allies get ready Eggman was up and furious to see his chance of ending the annoying hedgehog slip away. He placed his hand in the cool water and pulled out a red gem that was glowing rapidly bright you swear it be Rudolph&#39;s nose. The 5 seconds she entered in the portal, it closed. Suddenly, his cellphone started to ring.</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. One by one, the ponies fell in. she says. This is a big moment for the two of you!</p>

<p>They went to their individual 4th period class. Pretty amethysts eyes, and a star on her flank. It showed a woman, a man, and some kind of cat. They took a step near a window and began to talk. It&#39;s a longshot, but a shot nonetheless.</p>

<p>Twilight was in her home, which was also the local library, cleaning with her #1 assistant Spike the Dragon, the two had finished their chores and the little dragon was ready to take a nap until a letter magically came out of his mouth in a green flame, Spike picked up the letter and walked up to Twilight with it.</p>

<p>Tails sees Twilight coming and tries and look natural. Tails said to them. Rainbow asked. APPLEJACK!</p>

<p>Twilight blushed at this statement. Bad news is, the frying pan with 20 hot dogs went flying the air. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I ship Sonic and Rainbow Dash, but to be fair, I&#39;m sticking with Sonic and Sally for this story. they said. I just don&#39;t to look like a coward out there.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, you really do care about your friends,&quot; says Rainbow Dash.</p>

<p>But it&#39;ll cost ya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong?</p>

<p>&quot;And we&#39;re here for a reason.&quot;</p>

<p>But I can assure you, he will be back.&quot;</p>

<p>She was the Element of Honesty after all…Knuckles was trying to get his brain around the matter of how a machine could work by himself while Applejack fell asleep from too much cider.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m so flattered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How are you, you so called leader?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way man, you totally ROCKED at speed!</p>

<p>NO DONUTS FOR YOU!&quot;</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack slowly trotted into the barn and gasped when they found a yellow fox sitting on a bale of hay, nursing one of his two tails. As Applejack had said, there was nothing special although bucking season WAS coming up soon and they had so many apples that she was worried she might a have a repeat of last year…she didn&#39;t want to think about the lack of sleep she got from that season!</p>

<p>While they were clean around the bathroom area, they encountered one of the popular teens, Scourge. Pretty amethysts eyes, and a star on her flank. The CMCs did the same. &#39;I wonder if these people have any food around here. They probably would&#39;ve kept talking, but Sonic heard something that sent shivers down his spine.</p>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Tails are you okay?</h2>

<p>Hello, Hola, Bonjour and what-not!</p>

<p>Twilight had arrived back to her house. C&#39;mon Shads! I am being serious. It was surrounded by wires, panels, nuts and bolts and assorted other things. Calvin asked. Knuckles was introduced to Twilight, and even though Knuckles was still laughing over the Sonic incident, he managed to talk to Tails with a straight face.</p>

<p>Silver closes the door and Sonic ran to Tails&#39; place. Her eyes were watering. Mickey asked. She summoned him here.&#39; I have another idea!</p>

<p>&quot;Sound familiar in any way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How does &#39;Sonic Impact&#39; sound?&quot;</p>

<p>Because I do NOT like getting dirt in my quills thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p>I BET&#39;S IT&#39;S YOU!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No…but Sonic is hers, if you get me.&quot;</p>

<p>Twilight was startled at Tails&#39; sudden outburst at the rabbit. Rainbow hid her face in embarrassment and Sonic banged his head on the nearest wall.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Pinkie and Applejack were having lunch at Cupcake Corner. Kiyo then realized what he said is true. Whatever it was, it took off so fast that Rainbow hardly had time to see the blue blur. Umm….</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. The judges tally their scores.</p>

<p>There was a city. They stopped in mid air, frozen by some unseen force. I can never beat her.</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. xD </p>

<p>The three all cheered as they sent the madman flying away. But I have nothing!</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. Sonic yelled. she asked. And you are currently the fastest thing there is. I have everything under control!</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. He was a white Unicorn with sky blue hair and tail. They had heard the explosion, but had no time to see the flash, as they were inside a barn at the time. said a female voice. Outside, Amy and Pinkie came up to the window without the others noticing.</p>

<p>Then Pinkie&#39;s ears started flopping, her legs started shacking, and her eyes went batty (In that order). Everyone laughs. Knuckles replied with a grin, chuckling to the foxes mouth which was covered in syrup. Pinkie Pie chimed with joy. No poison or anything.</p>

<p>Silver walked into the Nurse&#39;s office and sat by Fluttershy&#39;s bed. She started to sob with tears streaming down her light blue face. She froze his shadow, causing him to be stuck, for one cannot move without their shadow moving too. For what reason?</p>

<p>The ignition of a very large motor engine (gotcha, didn&#39;t I?). WE WANT TO RACE HERE!</p>

<p>I am also good with guns and machines&quot; Max added</p>

<p>&quot;Is Applejack alright?&quot;</p>

<p>So both the pony and the hedgehog prepared to race to Sweet Apple Acres (Sonic had been given directions-and after all Twilight and Applejack were there too so they might as well get to there to meet them.</p>

<p>Behind a line drawn by Pikachu, Sonic and Dash were getting ready. Sonic moaned and clutched his head as he had fallen head first. Oh! She accidently crashes the spy fly into the wall. Suddenly he fell over. Keep up!</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t realize it until it was over, but a crowd had formed outside of the clubhouse. she asked. Tails is trying to figure that one out. Nichimon was first to speak.</p>

<p>Sonic smiles and gets up letting out a chuckle readying himself for a good smack down, as the allies get ready Eggman was up and furious to see his chance of ending the annoying hedgehog slip away. The blue Hedgehog turned around to see the other Chaos Emeralds. ;D</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I have the feeling I&#39;ll get along well with the rainbow haired peguas pony?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, let me guess.</p>

<p>Then another guy came floating down. Where am I? How did she know?!</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Sonic spoke. I&#39;LL DO ANYTHING!</p>

<p>THANK YOU! HA! She flew around at supersonic speed (she accidently charged at 5 people, causing them to wake up) to see where she was. 30 seconds later, Ash lifted his head off of the golden sand and saw to filmier figures. This is delicious!</p>

<p>Shadow was looking at an empty plate. Spike walked in, staring at me like I was different. He walked over, Nichimon releasing his shadow, and stroked Derpy&#39;s cheek.</p>

<p>However, as Rainbow was thinking about how she felt a little strange, Twilight was thinking the exact same thing. One by one, the ponies fell in. She could get in the way of Tails, and then she would be left alone, with no partn-</p>

<p>He had no idea where he was, but his main priority was to find his friends…now that he thought about it, he didn&#39;t have a single clue where is friends could be. The blue Hedgehog turned around to see the other Chaos Emeralds. See you guys later! But before he can run, a pink hedgehog with a red dress and pretty emerald eyes dog piled Sonic. Applejack asked.</p>

<p>Amy barged into Sugarcube Corner and startled who had just let a three-tier cake covered in chocolate icing fall to the ground. Tails started but before he could finish he was interrupted by a large bang that occurred outside the machine. Thank God it didn&#39;t go very far before it hit water. Then she went down the other side and went up the Loop-de-loop on the other side. Don&#39;t try anything to hurt rainbow, alright?</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. He did for now. The two best buddies dashed downstairs. But who knows, I can be wrong.</p>

<p>Both of them walking inside and into the basement. And Calvin was chewing on chocolate chip cookies. I might throw in some more sonicXRD in this</p>

<p>&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s here!&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow put their stuff in the room pinkie gave them. Pinkie screamed, and woke both of them up. That room was the Robotics room. I have got to get to the food court now, got a job there. Rainbow sat down on the couch, playing her WiiU and she didn&#39;t notice Sonic staring at her.</p>

<p>Unknown and Amanda caught up to them. Dash said. The picture that was on the back of his coat was imprinted onto his flank, a gold ring encasing a green gem. It came from a six year old kid with black pants, red and black striped shirt, and yellow spike hair. TURN IT OFF! Rainbow took off to the sky with a whoosh of her wings.</p>

<p>After Tails and Sonic&#39;s private quarrel, and Fluttershy&#39;s feeding of animals, they decided to head back to Twilights library and discuss sleeping plans. It looked like it was made of silver. They sighed and knew it was one of Tails&#39; failed experiments. Pinkie pulled something out of her settle bag. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>They both headed downstairs to check on Tails&#39; experiments. the cat tags on. I&#39;LL DO ANYTHING!</p>

<p>Tails&#39; face fell. Amy replied and bounced off happy as ever. Tails and Cream clapped.</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. Today, sonic was snoozing comfortably on the couch in the apartment when rainbow came in with a big box in her hands. Cream argued. Just then, the center emerald shoot beams of energy to the other jewels. Ah what a perfect day. She placed the plate on the table and knuckles grab the rainbow cupcake and took a bite out of it.</p>

<p>Strangely, she felt a little jealous too. They sighed and knew it was one of Tails&#39; failed experiments. He didn&#39;t have a grudge for Wave but that fact that she annoyed him back when Extreme Gear racing was a way of earning a little money still set him off a bit.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Silver almost half screamed. She was talking with Ash. Mom needed the computer for her finals and we went to an assembly for Jehovah witness&#39;s for the weekend.</p>

<p>Sonic spin-dashed him to the ground, and Vector could feel the heat off his face. Applejack? When?</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m alright,&quot; Spike told her.</p>

<p>&quot;SONIIIIIIIIIIIIC!&quot;</p>

<p>Calvin coughed, &quot;What was THAT!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;PIKACHU!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually yes,&quot; Shadow tells them.</p>

<p>Is she Sonic&#39;s special someone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so fast you blue blur!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The irony,&quot; Mario says in embarrassment.</p>

<p>Now for that announcement I was talking about. She flew over to her. Elise?</p>

<p>At this he ran up a hill and soared up into the air when he reached the top. TELL ME!</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. The members of the club went to the observation window but they can&#39;t hear what Silver and Sonic are saying.</p>

<p>Everyone already signed up the Kart race. Her hair was streaked rainbow but it was obviously natural. NO! They walked across a log in the middle of a stream. Rainbow thought and began to speed up, landing into the forest itself and dodging trees with graceful ease.</p>

<p>Twilight got out and waited at the door for Tails, while Fluttershy drove off. Silver had a bandage on the spot where Trixie threw the GameBoy at. Spike and Twilight chuckled at the fox&#39;s innocent ways. I guess it&#39;s been a long time anyways. &#39;Is he under a spell?&#39; Twilight was trying to keep her balance as Knuckles kept on running into their kart.</p>

<p>College is tough these days and sonic and rainbow knows firsthand. Calvin said. Tails stated.</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. Dash opened and straightens her wings. A filmier figure is what they say. GO! Rainbow Dash immediately flies into the clear sky and started to kick the clouds into nothingness. they said.</p>

<p>Tails wondered what Sonic was up to as he washed. Twilight asked as she helped him up. Riddles shock his head. I want to show you something outside.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. It just ain&#39;t cool. Applejack almost pinned down Knuckles&#39; arm to the wooden surface of the table. Sonic and Rainbow signed up at the last second.</p>

<p>5 minutes later the two kids (and Hobbes) where in the forest (which is called Hobbes Creek). We have somewhat similar writing styles, except she adds humor to hers. Her hair was streaked rainbow but it was obviously natural. Cream tripped up over her feet and crash landed into the basement. Susie managed to block it back.</p>

<p>I LOVE IT!&quot;</p>

<p>Soon everyone else woke up. When Cadence and Shining Armor, Twilight&#39;s big brother, got married, Shining gave Cadence a locket. replied Twilight. Right now, I am in cream&#39;s mom&#39;s car on the way to school. Oswald said. Susie managed to block it back.</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. Don&#39;t talk about…..uh-oh not again! they screamed as they got sucked in. Fluttershy squeaks. You want to be a cheerleader?</p>

<p>The night quickly came and everyone arrived. James said. Calvin said. Sonic asked Twilight. I got too caught up in that stupid video!</p>

<p>Sonic focused his mind around the spotlight and it was engulfed with light blue aura. He could feel it, he felt…the magic of friendship. Keio said. wha..</p>

<p>Now you wanna be free</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. Tails said putting his hand on her shoulder. How did you make it? she asked.</p>

<p>Blade was walking towards the Dress shop, where Fluttershy and Twilight was at and he looked through the window and saw Twilight trying on an expensive looking dress.</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Trixie ordered room service. He took another bite of it. I don&#39;t cuss</p>

<p>Sonic realized that this was the third body he had, and possibly the third name. Shadow just shrugged and flipped some burgers. Twilight giggled at this. he asked. I thought you, out of all of the funniest people to be around with, would go!</p>

<p>The two birds rushed around outside the lounge, getting the stuff ready for whatever Jet had in mind. Mario said. The green hawk pulled out a guitar from the thin air behind his back.</p>

<p>&quot;Uhm…yeah.</p>

<p>She spoke, &quot;My name is-&quot; &quot;Twilight Sparkle,&quot; Sonic says.</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. He saw rainbow sitting on the park bench, looking at her reflection in the lake.</p>

<p>Tails bounced around a bit. Rarity asked Sonic to look after Sweetie Belle, saying she wasn&#39;t supposed to go anywhere outside a two hundred foot radius of Sonic. Pretty amethysts eyes, and a star on her flank. I don&#39;t have anything!</p>

<p>As matter fact, I reckon I&#39;m the strongest person at this party,&quot; Applejack says to the Pokémon trainer.</p>

<p>What&#39;s goi-&quot; Spike started but was cut off.</p>

<p>That helps me a lot!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; he whimpered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Twilight and Applejack were mildly chatting about business on the farm. Amanda and (newcomer) Blade were just walking do the halls, talking.</p>

<p>They both charged at each other and was furiously attacking each other at amazing speed. Even if he had no clue who she is, he felt sorry for her. The rabbit seemed to know Tails well…and Twilight didn&#39;t like that. A filmier figure is what they say. Amy replied and bounced off happy as ever. Not the best, but still good</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. She saw a figure flying into the window that was broken. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. A figure was appearing from the blinding sight. said Twilight. Pinkie catching up to Amy.</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. He placed his hand in the cool water and pulled out a red gem that was glowing rapidly bright you swear it be Rudolph&#39;s nose. It was almost time for her to start worrying. Kieo asked. She sighed and put the box down and banged on the wall near the couch to wake up sonic.</p>

<p>SRS CHAPTER IS SRS! She flew over to her. I DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING!</p>

<p>&quot;Take a guess&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet you 15…uh…&#39;bits&#39; that I can clear 10 trees faster then you can!</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, what&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Calvin?</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Aura the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rarity asked. His expression was hard and cold as ever. Maleficent raised her staf to the sky. Whatever happened on the other side was something beyond Dashy&#39;s imagination.</p>

<p>They made it to the class in the nick of time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Maybe it&#39;s a Chaos Emerald</h2>

<p>Tonight is a big night for the students of the T.J.</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. She ordered few treats for her friends and a rainbow cupcake for herself. Bowser roared. She hollered. She soon found him, strolling out of the library, and getting ready to run off back to Rarity&#39;s Boutique.</p>

<p>Rainbow helped sonic of the rainbow and the two returned to the Dorm. Vector shouted. Oh wait, I can&#39;t fire you. The truck was still on their tail, and Canterlot High was not too far away. Rainbow tried her hardest to stop laughing at the unfortunately shy pony.</p>

<p>Tails had been frightened to death by the sudden appearance of the two ponies and had tugged on one of his appendages. Spike walked in, staring at me like I was different. AARON! I being watching them from the corner of my eye for some time now. he asked. The explosion caused them to be rocketed into the mud.</p>

<p>Intrigued, she stepped back a little to see the screen a little better. I&#39;m sure you all are eager and excited to see your friends perform. He&#39;s a nice boy. They turned their heads to see 20 meters ahead that some sand fell. Evil Aaron is EVIL!</p>

<p>Rainbow was there when Sonic last met Necromius. Mario yelled. Rarity said. Tails said. Tails said with a smile.</p>

<p>The Royal Guards carried the two fainted hedgehogs with their magic bringing them to the infirmary, while Celestia began writing a letter to her faithful student Twilight Sparkle. Sonic ran off so fast that all that was left was a blue streak.</p>

<p>Luna handed them a silver trophy filled with 3000$. Your bring powers in this then I&#39;m gamed! XD</p>

<p>Rainbow walks up the counter and asks for some ketchup packs, but the cashier was a dick and decided to pick the EXTREME hot sauce packs and just for a FYI, hot sauce upsets rainbow&#39;s stomach A LOT. Dash asked. She stuck out her hoof and Amy half bro-fisted, half grabbed it and shook.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow turned from the hole from the wall to see Mario stick Wario&#39;s butt in front of their faces. It was the King of Speed himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. She wrapped her hooves around his neck nearly strangling him and pulling him to the dirt. Shadow said. There was no sunlight streaming through, the darkness only looming around. Let&#39;s win this</p>

<p>A phoenix was all that came to mind for Sonic. They looked at the girdle to see burgers. Rouge put her ear to the door, but heard nothing. He tried to look behind him by turning around and running backwards, but he hit the building, breaking a hole in the wall, and falling inwards. So please come quickly.</p>

<p>Twilight and the others decided to go back to her library, as that would probably be the first place Sonic and Rainbow would go if they had found anyone. Sonic had always been like this. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. He called. Knuckles took control and run into Twilight&#39;s kart. Sonic grew furious and impatient, he kicked the door open and took back and saw Mario passed out on his couch, drooling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Knuckles and Applejack were sipping a cool drink of cider. Let&#39;s check it out.</p>

<p>&quot;AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</p>

<p>Amy tasted the cupcake and her pupils started to dilate. Here! Kiyo asked. Look behind us!</p>

<p>And also do some other chaotic stuff,&quot; Discords says to his fellow friends.</p>

<p>You are now going to get you&#39;re as-,&quot; Mario started but was cut off by a flashing light.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my Princess Cealstia, I&#39;m not hearing things.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey girls,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened to you?&quot;</p>

<p>Twilight got out and waited at the door for Tails, while Fluttershy drove off. The women wore green earrings, black gloves and boots and, a white skirt, and a white shirt with a red R on it. Rarity, Sweetie Belle, Applebloom, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Twilight and Scootaloo. Knuckles is up then Applejack then Tails and Twilight. Soon after, he excused himself to bed. Bet I can beat them both.</p>

<p>Twilight sat in her library, watching the events on camera, and wondering how many views this could rack up on PonyTube. They got to the parking lot when Sonic hear a crash about a mile behind him. They called it the Summer Beach Bash to celebrate the 1st day of summer.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s what we saw when you and your friends fell out of the sky!&quot;</p>

<p>They started pushing and everyone was cheering them on. Ash questioned. One of the strangest things is that Hobbes is alive. The screech pierced the air, and Sonic&#39;s eyes went wide. SONIC!</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Mickey said.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow went home after Flutter&#39;s concert, which ended great. It was raining chocolate milk. He got a 60$ gift card to GameStop and a gold trophy with his name on it</p>

<p>A male voice shouted, &quot;Make it double.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dose this answer your question?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remind me never to doubt the power of a princess.&quot;</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. He looked down at the crème filling that was oozing out. She is standing at the resignation desk.</p>

<p>Well who am I to refuse!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll save them!&quot;</p>

<p>That weird light that always came around when Silver used his… &quot;Psychokinesis&quot; also showed up here.</p>

<p>The audience and the racers clapped and cheered for the kids. Fluttershy exclaimed. Riddles said. We both have to go to school and I can take care of her. Let&#39;s go in!</p>

<p>We interrupt this fanfiction for a couple of hours due to Aaron&#39;s severe burns from unicorn magic. With cyan blue skin/fur, a lighting butt tattoo, and wings. Mario is coming! Sonic and Rainbow signed up at the last second.</p>

<p>&quot;How does &#39;Sonic Impact&#39; sound?&quot;</p>

<p>Be right back.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them walking inside and into the basement. Also if the OC&#39;s that already appeared in the story wants to sing a song for open-mic, send us the song and we&#39;ll look them up.</p>

<p>Oh Christ I&#39;m getting later by the day. She grabbed an apple and bitten into it and walked away to chat with Luigi. He fell over on the soft sand. An EGG-shaped MAN? she said. Either that or he was too tired at the moment to register the surprise.</p>

<p>At this time, Tails had just finished his hedgehog tracker and Twilight was very impressed with his efforts. she said. Trixie? Flutter said gloomily.</p>

<p>Mrs. &#39;She must have done something to Discord. You said that magic is very important for a lot of things in this world. Plus, not everyone at the age of 18 go to college, they can go whenever they want (or at least that&#39;s how my state runs I think). She could get in the way of Tails, and then she would be left alone, with no partn-</p>

<p>Tails and the others laughed at Rainbows statement, and Tails adjusted a spring in his machine. They were also stomping the beat of We Will Rock You. He did for now. Who are you? Sonic ran into Rainbow, who was running late due to her not getting enough sleep.</p>

<p>Amy pressed the button and launched the bomb towards Cream and Rouge. Knuckles (the party boy) have convinced the teachers and principle to host the 16th annual party. YOU&#39;RE FIRED! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!? Do you like rainbow dash?</p>

<p>&quot;The locket that Shining gave you and you refuse to take off… where is it now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, so what&#39;s powering this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm, well I think Tails can sleep here.</p>

<p>&quot;No.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a fire at Sweet Apple Acres!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are birds after all.&quot;</p>

<p>The night quickly came and everyone arrived. I can&#39;t see!</p>

<p>The Babylon Rogues were, at last, finding their way through the maze that was…a field.</p>

<p>Dash suddenly felt some pony&#39;s hand on her shoulder, which was actually burning. I got everything down. But…It feels like it&#39;s connecting to the other emeralds. My ultimate powers were showing through. He noticed that his fur was all over the place. he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. And Ash and his friends deal with Team Rocket. And his Cutie Mark was a gold ring with a green emerald in the middle.</p>

<p>Tails meet some new friends of mine that I just met, this here fox is Max who appears to have twin tails just like you and almost has your voice but deeper&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mama me a!&quot;</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what went wrong!&quot;</p>

<p>Knuckles grabbed Applejack and put her in his arms while he glided down to safety. The smoked cleared. The new formed friends looked at her with fear. Sonic asked. Dash was too curious to leave it alone, and boy was she glad she decided to check it out later. Stop reading my mind, literally!</p>

<p>Twilight blushed at this statement. Bowser said. Sonic stopped dead in his tracks. Rainbow sat down on the couch, playing her WiiU and she didn&#39;t notice Sonic staring at her.</p>

<p>Little did the hedgehog know he was being followed by a madman waiting to ambush his speedy foe. He yelled. Mb7 have a stomach virus. Twilight and the gang gasped and ran to the window…to find absolutely nothing. After he fainted many Guards came in to protect their princess and surrounded the two supposed threats, but then they heard a voice commanding them to halt in their position.</p>

<p>This road never looked so lonelyThis house doesn&#39;t burn down slowlyTo ashes, to ashes</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. His eyes were somewhere between yellow and orange. Now we need a tie breaker!</p>

<p>Rainbow is lead sonic to the front of the complex to show him their project, a miniature replica of Mobius, but it wasn&#39;t done yet. But she was completely thrown off by his answer.</p>

<p>Amy woke up in the infirmary, light-headed and woozy. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. Mickey couldn&#39;t stop thinking about. the older one yelled. Let&#39;s check it out.</p>

<p>R.I.P. Suddenly Zatch felt a breeze of wind behind him. We&#39;re going to fail!</p>

<p>Cream waited patiently and her mind was about to wander off into dreaming when a rope ladder was dropped down and Wave slid smoothly down the ladder. He creates robots out of poor baby animals, we call them Flickies, and then he sets them free. Everyone looked at creatures that fell from that portal thing. Burning and falling to pieces. Amanda took the trophy and dumped all the money onto Unknown.</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Said the now-hyperventilating-and curled-up-into-a-corner Sonic.</p>

<p>Before he could finish, rainbow quickly snatched the flyer out of his hand and begin reading it out loud to the group.</p>

<p>The crowd applauses and the judges give their scores.</p>

<p>They went to their individual 4th period class. Why are we at Sonics house? Besides that, enjoy!</p>

<p>I am requesting that you gather your friends and come to Canterlot immediately, I do not know if the situation is an emergency, but you must come here right now, there are these two creatures that seem to be hedgehogs, they just came out of nowhere and crashed into the throne room, I wonder if Fluttershy will be able to calm them down if they get out of control. The girl looked something like Dash. This activated a metal machine part which clamped down on the main pod, which held Sonic, Knuckles and Amy at the moment. Unknowing to her, Amy switch Pinkie&#39;s cupcake which rainbow ordered with her cupcake. When?</p>

<p>While they were clean around the bathroom area, they encountered one of the popular teens, Scourge. Rainbow Dash flew on over to Rouge. &#39;She must have done something to Discord. They vow to take over the Disney parks. Except Shadow, he&#39;s a bit emo and doesn&#39;t see her with fear or alarm. After school, drop by my place.</p>

<p>Tails got out of the shower and began to dry himself. Everyone nodded. Pinkie&#39;s tail started to twitch. He has short light blue hair, forest green eyes, and a short nose. Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Amy looked around to make sure no one is following her and went into the closet and slammed the door. Lead the way.</p>

<p>He looked at the voice and saw a white unicorn with wings… no alicorn. Tails landed with a loud BAM on the sand. Mickey yelled. Applejack hiccoughed as she stumbled across the barn.</p>

<p>The lights in the gym dimmed out and Celestia walked on stage.</p>

<p>There was a hard banging on the door. She had long and black horns on her head. Celestia was surely to kill us. Pinkie Pie then nodded and ordered a small pouch of chocolate powder. The rest of Sonic&#39;s friends family came rushing to the hedgehog and fox. Get in!</p>

<p>Rainbow looked at Knuckles with fear. But not before Pinkie had a meltdown and jumped all over the place.</p>

<p>&quot;I am… Metal Sonic.</p>

<p>About Amy tho-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we sleep on the bed of course, remember we have to rest up to get those Chaos gems or whatever you call them before that egghead does&quot;</p>

<p>Knuckles and Rouge was at the door in a new look and Amy didn&#39;t notice them. Susie asked. &#39;Is he under a spell?&#39; I thought I wouldn&#39;t see ya again little buddy! I&#39;m getting payback!</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. She called out to him and an answer came from one of the corners upstairs. You&#39;re the Italian idiotic man that keeps on interrupting 96, Unwaterd, and DemonFiccer! he asked. Susie turned around and did the same thing as Calvin, run for their life. Sonic answered it and Mario comes busting in.</p>

<p>Mickey, what&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic asked, &quot;So, how did you all get here?&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic had stopped directly in the centre of Ponyville after a mad race through Equestria trying to lose Amy. I had this idea for this story before I had an account. Mickey swallowed hard. She hides behind the corner, out of Amy&#39;s sight.</p>

<p>Trixie got mad and threw her Gameboy at Silver, which hit him in the head. It was a creature with a pony head. O_0</p>

<p>Rainbow is lead sonic to the front of the complex to show him their project, a miniature replica of Mobius, but it wasn&#39;t done yet. Sonic asked. Everyone was dancing, eating socializing and partying like there&#39;s no tomorrow. I guess it&#39;s been a long time anyways. You need to look your best for Twilight!</p>

<p>we could use the feedback</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. wtf just happened</h2>

<p>Hi everyone.</p>

<p>Tails got out of the shower and began to dry himself. Rarity is busy tonight, plus we don&#39;t need her. Apparently, one had landed in the Everfree Forest, another in Sweet Apple Acres, and the other two landed on the outskirts of town. Probably not an extreme gear race. Her and Pinkie have been hanging out a bit too much</p>

<p>A phoenix was all that came to mind for Sonic. Peach questions. Discord looked at the mare he loved. Zatch! Maleficent laughed manically. It made Sonic double over in fear.</p>

<p>Rainbow went to the food stand to grab some snacks. You and your friends are mutant animals, which makes sense why you&#39;re talking. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. She said, almost bursting into tears. Just then, another person awoken. The audience was seriously surprised at this turn of events, even the racers and Celestia and Luna.</p>

<p>Spike woke me up, by repetitively poking me. Why? Tia and Zatch asked. I own nothing (BTW if you read the Shadow! Then some pony came up to the grave. You&#39;re known for your confidence and stubbornness and you are going to let some girl stop you?</p>

<p>Everyone cheered for her and carried her off</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright flash of light knocked Tails back into Sonic. Ash asked. It was my turn. and Mrs. Aura exclaimed in annoyance</p>

<p>Oh Christ I&#39;m getting later by the day. Since they are evil, they try to get rid of Keepers, other Disney characters that are not villains, and me. It was a gem with a music note inside, and a heart covered microphone bursting out of it.</p>

<p>Why am I not I Tails the FOX?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok, so let&#39;s go find some hedgehogs!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I thought you can only switch with dark magic.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a friend from Equestria; she went back about two years ago.</p>

<p>All three drivers floored their karts to the fastest they can go. Now, pay up!</p>

<p>Tails moaned. Soon after, he excused himself to bed. Applejack and Applebloom asked. It was Metal and Chrysalis, talking about the thing beyond the mirror coming sooner than they hoped. Apparently, one had landed in the Everfree Forest, another in Sweet Apple Acres, and the other two landed on the outskirts of town. No one really knew what it was supposed to be, except Rainbow and Knuckles.</p>

<p>Tails bounced around a bit. Then she heard some pony talking to each other outside. But Pinkie was determined and pulled up a stool next to Amy.</p>

<p>THANK YOU! Sonic moaned and clutched his head as he had fallen head first. Knuckles turned to Tails</p>

<p>Rainbow had the obvious advantage of flying, after all, having wings did kind of help. He walked upstairs, feeling quite confident that the machine would work, but even though the odds were in their favour for the machine to work (at a 67% chance no doubt) Tails felt a twinge of nervousness. He brought me this cool necklace! The little kid shoots out a tremendous amount of lighting at Sonic and Rainbow Dash. Storm smirked.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Tails!</p>

<p>Sounds Good?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That tears it, prepare to be ROADKILL!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should turn the sand into ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Just give that gem of miracle, the Chaos Emerald, and I&#39;ll be on my way to my castle with my new wife.&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow weakly looked at each other. Now&#39;s my chance to get him for myself! Mario is coming! Cream shyed away a little, almost mocking Fluttershy, then mumbled.</p>

<p>Sonic woke up on the roof of a building. There was no evidence that this was an accident, the wires that powered the lights for Ponyville all ran underground. Megumi squealed. Spike ran and kissed Rarity&#39;s hoof. She&#39;s upstairs.</p>

<p>Speaking of the cobalt hedgehog, at this very moment he was out for his morning jog, running along a grassy land which was full of cows, pigs and other assorted animals as the morning sun, full of bright energy, crept up on the still-sleeping farm. Sorry</p>

<p>Tails and the others laughed at Rainbows statement, and Tails adjusted a spring in his machine. Mickey couldn&#39;t stop thinking about. Sonic ended the call and ran the other way, back to Tails&#39; house.</p>

<p>Vinyl throws it on and the music starts. Applebloom says. yelled a girl&#39;s voice. Tails said. We are trying to update this daily</p>

<p>The Royal Guards carried the two fainted hedgehogs with their magic bringing them to the infirmary, while Celestia began writing a letter to her faithful student Twilight Sparkle. She rushed to Sonic&#39;s room and saw him asleep in his bed. Just then, beings came falling down from them. Sorry.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles fought over the driving wheel and result in them crashing into the wall, destroying their kart. Tails remembered that Knuckles and Amy were going to be coming to visit Chris. But there was something else to it that she just knew was there, she could see it, just feel it. Mickey screamed. When they all landed, they fell in a puff of smoke. Applejack knew she had heard the sound around the same time as Knuckles and the others had appeared, and said it to Knuckles.</p>

<p>It was little above their budget but rainbow threw in some cash and they mange. again this was an alicorn. Fluttershy exclaimed. Rainbow didn&#39;t come due to Amy pouring hot sauce on Rainbow&#39;s pizza and Rainbow didn&#39;t notice. Going to the dentist tomorrow.</p>

<p>Twilight sat in her library, watching the events on camera, and wondering how many views this could rack up on PonyTube. She flew over to her. Celestia answered him with a suspicious look</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;And a new world shall rise from the ashes,&#39; yes,&quot; Shadow confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;My home dimension has better guards then talking mushrooms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s my dad&#39;s first pen.</p>

<p>Sonic stormed to Mario&#39;s door and banged on it. They had heard the explosion, but had no time to see the flash, as they were inside a barn at the time. Peach ran to the nearest door, but was grabbed by Bowser. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>Pinkie comes walking normally up to Sonic and Rainbow</p>

<p>Jet shifted uncomfortably in his seat. The truck was still on their tail, and Canterlot High was not too far away. Then the emerald thing fell in. Twilight went through that mirror once to get her tiara back from Sunset Shimmer, who came from beyond the mirror to take it for herself. Luigi ran, jumped, and punched the ball back. XD</p>

<p>Now for that announcement I was talking about. They took seats next to their friends. Whoa! Thanks, Rarity!</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. I&#39;ll give you some time to think). As soon as Pinkie moved on to Sonic with her REALLY big knife, Rainbow stated to panic and beg Pinkie not to do it. The minute Sonic saved her was the minute Necromius set his sights on killing Sonic. Even me and Luna are anxious to see the winners!</p>

<p>&quot;This must have been the thing that fell from the sky!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok not bad, but who are you guys exactly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least we have TV dinners that we can heat in the microwave, Mom doesn&#39;t trust me with an oven.&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic just shrugged and picked up the object the &quot;Faker&quot; had dropped.</p>

<p>Both of them went to their own rooms. Rarity said. He fell to the ground. Everyone suddenly went skyrocketing to the sky. Even brilliant inventors such as Tails had their bad moments and one of them was inside Tails&#39; basement at the moment.</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. Tails said. Mickey swallowed hard. He placed a cup on the table and walked off looking pissed off. Kiyo asked. How did she know?!</p>

<p>He looked at the voice and saw a white unicorn with wings… no alicorn. Fine then, I&#39;ll get more proof if it kills me!</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. Er, Sorry Rainbow…</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be fine Rainbow,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;You look different.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We ran into the enemies of Ash and Sonic.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!</p>

<p>The Royal Guards carried the two fainted hedgehogs with their magic bringing them to the infirmary, while Celestia began writing a letter to her faithful student Twilight Sparkle. they yelled. Sonic smirked. It sounds like mad doctor voice. After 5 minutes of chatting. Not eating?</p>

<p>&quot;Well sure we can talk, you seem to be able to, not trying to be rude though&quot; Aura replied</p>

<p>&quot;This is stranger then the Bilolizard&quot; Sonia said.</p>

<p>&quot;ON THE COUNT OF THREE!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rainbow Dash, if only you knew…&quot; Tails started.</p>

<p>&quot;Hugh, my head…&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw something outside the castle this morning.</p>

<p>Sonic got back to Tails&#39; house where he and Knuckles were waiting for him. It glowed rapidly. Mario is coming! We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. Keep up!</p>

<p>Blade walks on stage and he takes a breath. the two kids asked. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. He put down his laptop on the table and carried rainbow to her bed then he went to bed.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. Sadly the 2 kids and the stuff tiger got sucked in. Let&#39;s win this thing!</p>

<p>Can you please make me some of that calming herbal tea, so I can focus? then she looked at him. She spun it and it landed on sonic.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. After fire stop, Mickey was really black, grey, and crispy. Spike? Lead the way.</p>

<p>Tails got out of the shower and began to dry himself. His eyes were greener, like emeralds found more commonly in nature, and his skin was like any other human he saw in Spagonia, or Adabat. So….hot….</p>

<p>After about a week on four legs, Sonic had trouble getting back on two feet. The emerald started to glow. We was playing along</p>

<p>Flutter gave Twilight a ride to the Madison Le Cruset because she didn&#39;t have a car. What does it mean?&#39; said a female voice. said yet another alicorn. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. You go.</p>

<p>The unholy roar filled Tails&#39; and Sonic&#39;s heads as they were startled and flew back into a bookshelf. Brock asked. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. Rainbow followed him, although she was stunned. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. Mickey thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Applejack and Twilight had arrived at the farm. He flipped two burger patties onto two hamburger buns. By yourself?</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. There was no sunlight streaming through, the darkness only looming around. Bowser quickly lowered his head and spit out a fire ball. Fine then, I&#39;ll get more proof if it kills me!</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah…why do you want to know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Push…clouds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just as long as &#39;Sonic&#39; is part of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow went home after Flutter&#39;s concert, which ended great. Shadow blushed. Here!</p>

<p>Everyone agreed and left. Don&#39;t talk about…..uh-oh not again! Silver-</p>

<p>She turns on the aiming screen and grabbed the control stick. They pulled apart and blushed</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic?</p>

<p>&quot;Good sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m scared,&quot; Knanchome says.</p>

<p>And Amy?&quot;</p>

<p>And-they-can-walk-and-oh-my-I-must-get-some-food-t hey-must-be-hungry-wow-I-cannot-believe i-&quot; &quot;Flutter!</p>

<p>He had no idea where he was, but his main priority was to find his friends…now that he thought about it, he didn&#39;t have a single clue where is friends could be. Plus I will pay them back!</p>

<p>While the fox, hedgehog, unicorn and Pegasus were figuring out the events that could have led up to the finding of not one but two chaos emeralds, Amy, who was grumpy for not being mentioned in the story a lot (not that anyone cared) was storming around the town of Ponyville. Out of the shadows a blinking blue sword swung down, landing where Sonic was a second before. How are you doing?! Not in the same way that Flash Sentry used to be interested in Sunset Shimmer, but the way she first found a ball when she was old enough to kick it. Let&#39;s check it out.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. Hide in the closet!</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Mickey said.</p>

<p>&quot;Mickey!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the same world with the Stonecutter&#39;s Quill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Calvin told Susie.</p>

<p>&quot;My machine apparently went a little bit wrong, so it opened up a dimensional portal through space and time, and now we are in the amazing world of Equestria, a land ruled by ponies!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could stay with Applejack&quot;</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. He was groaning…his head hurt and he felt sick. When?</p>

<p>&quot;Actually Rainbow that&#39;s exactly what he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh come on Flutter, we&#39;ve been here countless time how can you still be scared?</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic…&quot; Tails started.</p>

<p>Cream was stuck with Vector and Espio. Then the figure holding the Sword came out of hiding, like a chameleon showing itself, from its hiding spot.</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. Her eyes were watering. Peach ran to the nearest door, but was grabbed by Bowser. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. Sonic&#39;s voice came squeaking out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. He yelled. He wore a white shirt, a blue tie, black shoes, and blue pants. Spike walked over and opened the door. Dash was too curious to leave it alone, and boy was she glad she decided to check it out later. Afterwards, she calm down and played her WIIU</p>

<p>Amy had also woken up with a start and almost pulled out her Piko Piko Hammer until she realised these ponies carried no threat. Meaning? Bad news is, the frying pan with 20 hot dogs went flying the air. I change my mind! It took that one comment for Sonic to remember everything.</p>

<p>exclaimed Twilight &quot;Well ah&#39;ll be damned Twilight how&#39;d ya&#39;ll know that?&quot;</p>

<p>The audience and the racers clapped and cheered for the kids. Dash exclaimed. THAT HOW HORNY I AM! It&#39;s the least I can do.</p>

<p>&quot;How was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Insane me?</p>

<p>&quot;He says that you can go shove your horn up your-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or should I say &#39;Sonic Impact&#39; now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?</p>

<p>&quot;SONIC!</p>

<p>Both girls pushed their opponent&#39;s hand with all of their strength. Pretty amethysts eyes, and a star on her flank. Knuckles had to introduce himself to Applejack before he started or he would probably be in court for defacing others property. Why had he set it so early? An EGG-shaped MAN? Pinkie opened the door and invited Flutter in.</p>

<p>-Ghost Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Tails are you okay?</h2>

<p>-The next day-</p>

<p>Sonic was going to Canterlot High for about a week when the spirit of the Fall Formal came around. Mario yelled. Peach ran to the nearest door, but was grabbed by Bowser. It didn&#39;t take long for her to charged at Sonic. She noticed that Tails said he was &#39;horny&#39;…this could prove useful later, she tho-</p>

<p>Rainbow was waiting for Sonic at Canterlot Castle. The DJ put the song on and Rarity begun to snap her fingers to the beat and started humming. He got into his room and got his shoes on. Rouge says. He hated waiting. Sure enough, after an hour of events, such as…</p>

<p>Sonic ran over to a blanket covering something</p>

<p>Everyone was just awestruck. Yoshi asked. I thought that was a stupid idea.</p>

<p>The party cannon shot a big strawberry cake at Rainbow. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Amanda. Then he heard something to his right. They did a little dance that Sonic was confused about for days to come (Popipo, Look it up). Did you bring all your food to a picnic or something?</p>

<p>As the curtains rised, the audience was greeted to the singer&#39;s backs. Jet said in his screechy voice.</p>

<p>We interrupt this fanfiction for a couple of hours due to Aaron&#39;s severe burns from unicorn magic. A small hovercraft hovered down. Sonic joyfully said. Hey, what are you doing?</p>

<p>When he got downstairs, he stopped dead in his tracks. Bad news is, the frying pan with 20 hot dogs went flying the air. The blue Hedgehog turned around to see the other Chaos Emeralds. Trixie looked at Silver and grinned.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. We can&#39;t stop him. She had long and black horns on her head. He looked around to see Bowser smiling, Yoshi and Luigi faces looked like they saw a Boo, and saw the Seven Stars glowing rapidly. Sonic knocked on his door and Tails opened it.</p>

<p>As he was told, Tails started his teleportation device as it was powering up, as soon as it was powering up the drone started to sabotage the device making it go haywire and malfunctioning. A small boy with a blue shirt thing, blue shoes, and golden hair got up and nodded. People were seriously getting down. Be right back</p>

<p>Sonic called Dominos but couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Rainbow. Sonic had always been like this. Silver shouted.</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. Zatch ran to open it. 2 kids with huge keys, a dog, duck, mouse, and rabbit. Sonic, here!</p>

<p>&quot;I know everything,&quot; Sonic says.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, yes Knucklehead.</p>

<p>&quot;Like they are your brother and sister,&quot; Mickey said.</p>

<p>Twilight blushed at this statement. At that point, both she and he are in a tie. Apparently ponies are the superior race here in Equestria. Maybe he can work at the nearby bakery&#39; Sonic though. Plus, out of all the mega blasters, I am the strongest!</p>

<p>Then carefully, grinning evilly and carrying the mug with her magic, she made her way back to the library…</p>

<p>Amy flicks out Rainbow, but she doesn&#39;t see it</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie were getting ready for the tie-breaker. Each fanfic writers always changes something here and there, it what give fics a little extra kick in quality. It had a blue stone in the ground. Sonic didn&#39;t know why, but he feels power, and doesn&#39;t know why. Oswald gave Mickey a noggin. It was Discord, the spirit of Chaos and Disharmony.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jet was confused at the fact that there were ponies around. You seem so familiar it aint even funny.</p>

<p>-Meanwhile-</p>

<p>&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p>So knowing a Chaos Control that powerful has to have also sent the rest of the Chaos Emeralds here too&quot;</p>

<p>Is he usually that fast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know as well I do I suck at riding anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need any help?&quot;</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Mario and Luigi yelled. I should mention that indeed the couples actually came to my mind from that fan-fiction. When Mario comes in, he will get hit with a bucket of icy cold water and if he is stupid enough, he will wander around and hit the set trap of mouse traps I have in his living room!</p>

<p>Sonic had been running for about an hour. They share apartments and share the same mean, ugly teachers who constantly gives their students (most partially sonic and rainbow) projects after projects, testes after testes. Then he heard something to his right. They walked into Twilight&#39;s Library. When?</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. He was a black Pegasus with a red mane and tail. what kind of test are we talking about?</p>

<p>SRS CHAPTER IS SRS! Mickey asked. The bell is about to ring!</p>

<p>Continuing on! Don&#39;t know me? again this was an alicorn. The two boys darted to the blue hedgehog. Sonic almost ran into several trees as his brain worked to try and figure out what these pony things were. You don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want to just asking</p>

<p>Everyone was looking at Sonic in shock. Sonic asked. They stopped in mid air, frozen by some unseen force. They were relaxing in a small lounge built specially for, well, lounging. APPLEJACK!</p>

<p>Mario went back inside but hasn&#39;t come back out in 20 minutes. We might need it. He reminded her of herself on a good day, when she would pick up a book…or twenty…and then read all of them successively.</p>

<p>Knuckles pulled out the phone that Rouge gave him and played the noises Rouge, which was with Amy and Pinkie was in the closet. Applebloom was jumping around happily, Sweetie belle was bowing elegantly (thanks to Rarity), Scootaloo and Babs was holding the golden trophy (barely, the thing weight more than them XD) looking triumphed. But I will find you. Spike and Twilight chuckled at the fox&#39;s innocent ways. The waiter came back to take their drinks order.</p>

<p>How many laps?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh boy, this is going to hurt&quot;  Aura thought to himself</p>

<p>Twilight was startled at Tails&#39; sudden outburst at the rabbit. As Calvin walks, he runs into Susie. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. Oh! Tails jogged upstairs and made some pancakes. Did you lose badly?</p>

<p>Storm resisted the urge to punch the little twat in the face.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhm…&quot; said Twilight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Twilight and Applejack were mildly chatting about business on the farm. Sonic and rainbow got done listening to the story of Laughing jack (if you don&#39;t know what that story is, look it up on YouTube). He fell over on the soft sand. It had a blue stone in the ground. Oswald said. Aura exclaimed in annoyance</p>

<p>Both of them walking inside and into the basement. The kid said. Just wait. You and your friends are mutant animals, which makes sense why you&#39;re talking. they yelled. Sonic felt a twinge of regret that he wasn&#39;t light enough to float on clouds so he could visit Rainbows house, but at the moment he was just glad he had a bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>Unknown and Amanda caught up to them. And they went skyrocketing again and fell down like before. The table wasn&#39;t big but was big enough for them to have leg room. Zatch asked. Suddenly Zatch felt a breeze of wind behind him. Twilight finished with a scream as Sonic and Rainbow ran into the barn at the exact same time, knocking the trio over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the library, Tails was examining the Chaos Emerald. But not before Pinkie had a meltdown and jumped all over the place.</p>

<p>The 6 ponies left Spike behind to look up in the library what could have been a possible cause of a random explosion in the sky, while they ran off to try find the cause of the explosion by asking other ponies. Ahem, anyway, see? I want you guys to draw us a picture of your favorite scene of this story. Mickey thought about the dream he had. When he was spotless and completely dry, he went down to his laboratory.</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. Sonic stumbled along for a second before looking around him, then gained speed and rushed off to try find his friends.</p>

<p>Sonic, Tails and Pinkie walked over to the Carousel Boutique and Sonic opened the door. He immediately noticed it, as it looked oddly like a Chaos Emerald…wait…it WAS a Chaos Emerald! was the reply.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Pinkie and Applejack were having lunch at Cupcake Corner. It was hard to get your name on it. YOUR PHONE IS RINGING! I don&#39;t want it to happen again!</p>

<p>Well...I don&#39;t think so, Cream…&quot; Vector said.</p>

<p>Intrigued, she stepped back a little to see the screen a little better. Of course, Knuckles had been so dense as to mock a unicorn FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 24 HOURS, and both Tails and Sonic knew that he was going to pay the price for it.</p>

<p>Vector received a boot to the head from Espio and a death glare from a now very red hedgehog.</p>

<p>Tails sees Twilight coming and tries and look natural. When he spread his wings the feathers of ravens that felt sharp as a knife. Sonic asked. I want you to do stuff for me</p>

<p>Blade and Amanda was duking out, either of them was holding back. The rabbit lost its footing and stumbled over the hole he had made when digging up the carrot. Sonic asked. The strange jewel glowed so bright it looked white. He was the only one who&#39;s Avatar made sense knowing his ability. Now, pay up!</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. They walked into Twilight&#39;s Library. It glowed even brighter. Give this man a Danish Coffee!</p>

<p>Sonic noticed the two of them and silently awwwed in his mind. Do you have any golden mushrooms?</p>

<p>Vinyl throws it on and the music starts. I know you can do better!</p>

<p>Rouge was secretly following Amy with her phone in her hand. Then she heard a crash coming from the castle. Mickey couldn&#39;t stop thinking about. We are going to try and combine all of them together.</p>

<p>Spike stared at me for a moment, before dashing out of the room. TURN IT OFF! Here! He started to rub his arms. I don&#39;t have anything!</p>

<p>Tails walked into the pod, carrying his mini console as a door sealed up behind him. WE ARE NOT IN ANY RELATIONSHIP! It&#39;s fable that&#39;s been passed around for centuries. No.</p>

<p>Mario couldn&#39;t help but ask, &quot;Why a theme park resort?&quot;</p>

<p>On the screen it started reading &quot;ERROR&quot; Tails tried to fix it, but it was too late as the Chaos Emerald powering the machine started to glow and shine a bright red light causing Chaos Control, Eggman started to smile but then it vanished as soon as the Chaos Control was enlarging, Eggman realized his plan had backfired and now everyone on Mobius had been warped to a new dimension.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Rainbow Dash told me how you got here.</p>

<p>-later-</p>

<p>They switched like you switch in Mario Kart Double Dash. Since grammar is not my strong point, don&#39;t expect this to be perfect. shouted a voice. Bowser lifted his head high. He opened up the very same bottle of maple syrup he had used that morning-and plunged the contents of it into the sink.</p>

<p>Sonic stormed to Mario&#39;s door and banged on it. So again please Review</p>

<p>After Tails and Sonic&#39;s private quarrel, and Fluttershy&#39;s feeding of animals, they decided to head back to Twilights library and discuss sleeping plans. They vow to take over the Disney parks. Get back up</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. Sonic looked at his new surprised friends. She was in Sonic&#39;s Arms, which was weird enough as it was, and he was running from what looked like a train that didn&#39;t need the tracks. It showed a woman, a man, and some kind of cat. It was more…lighter. It&#39;s a parody of American Idiot by Greenday and the lyrics were written by my good friend Shadowofdimentio</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. HA! Like I said before, she is a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. He did the super peel-out to get out of the way, but Sonic his guard down and got hit by her horn blast. she smiled at Amy who returned it with a frown. Charmy snorted, and flew off into a grassland, ignoring the shouts and swears from Wave who was being restrained by a struggling Storm.</p>

<p>However, one thing certainly peaked the gang&#39;s curiosity. He huffed and puffed heavily. she repeated more strictly.</p>

<p>Twilight had arrived back to her house. Bad news is, the frying pan with 20 hot dogs went flying the air. Applejack almost pinned down Knuckles&#39; arm to the wooden surface of the table. Come to think of it why DID Necromius want to kill Sonic?</p>

<p>Rouge maneuvers the fly to door and tries to find a crack in the wall or door. Sonic spoke. In front of them was some kind of dinosaur, turtle, and dragon thing. You can go up on stage and sing your favorite songs.</p>

<p>Scootaloo was speechless, her eyes wide and her jaw dropped. Zatch ran to open it. Just saying.</p>

<p>Cream was seriously starting to wonder if she had taken any drugs recently when Jet finished off with an epic guitar solo.</p>

<p>Cream was stuck with Vector and Espio. Everyone laughed. was the inquisitive reply.</p>

<p>I am the narrator of this small part of your life. His eyes were greener, like emeralds found more commonly in nature, and his skin was like any other human he saw in Spagonia, or Adabat. The echidna and the pony nodded. They took a step near a window and began to talk. she is following me and I&#39;ve been trying to get rid of her.</p>

<p>Just as he was drenching them in maple syrup, Knuckles and Amy wandered through the door. He felt an unusual gust of wind. She is struggling is school as is. Well, everypony except Pinkie of course. He adored these hills, just outside Tails and Sonic&#39;s houses, as they weren&#39;t inhabited by any creature or animal, so Sonic could run around all he wanted without disrupting anyone or anything. The judges tally their scores.</p>

<p>When he got downstairs, he stopped dead in his tracks. Knuckles was blushing, although because of his naturally red colour, nobody would notice. Mickey swallowed hard. They looked so much like Sonic but they were made of what looked like iron or steel.</p>

<p>Sonic was going to Canterlot High for about a week when the spirit of the Fall Formal came around. he was disgusted at what he saw. People are trying to sleep!</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. FINEFINE AGHHH!</h2>

<p>LATE CHAPTER ALERT</p>

<p>Amy had also woken up with a start and almost pulled out her Piko Piko Hammer until she realised these ponies carried no threat. Jet aid disappointedly.</p>

<p>Sonic held the flashlight while rainbow used the pliers to retrieve the object in flutter&#39;s throat. They all nodded, and as he did so he pressed a large button on his console. But 1 second later, the ground started to rumble. Ash questioned. And to those who don&#39;t know, when a character talks like this, their thinking.</p>

<p>He looked at the voice and saw a white unicorn with wings… no alicorn. She was in Sonic&#39;s Arms, which was weird enough as it was, and he was running from what looked like a train that didn&#39;t need the tracks. Tails is trying to figure that one out. There was just something about her that pulled him in, the same way his Dash could.</p>

<p>Cream and Vector had headed for Sonic and Tails&#39; house. Who are you!? Tails asked. And Flutter is hiding in the driver seat….</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. Rainbow said. &#39;Ah man. Twilight thought. I can&#39;t see!</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. RD asked. Why had he set it so early? Mickey swallowed hard. It was surrounded by wires, panels, nuts and bolts and assorted other things. Hey, have seen you two from somewhere?</p>

<p>Knuckles, who had been lazing around for most of the day, was woken by a moaning Appljeack. You are about to find out. She jumped out of her bed to hear Twilight snoring. Brock asked. Thanks and wish us luck.</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, Sweet name.&quot;</p>

<p>Flutter walk to Pinkie&#39;s house and knocked on the door. Mickey gulped. Now my time! she said. She hesitated for a second then aimed at the back of Rainbow&#39;s head, without Pinkie noticing.</p>

<p>Racing day is tomorrow and Amanda wants to be in it, but have no partner. I GOT IT! Shadow held out a pistol and aimed for a glass jar. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. Jet smiled.</p>

<p>However, as Rainbow was thinking about how she felt a little strange, Twilight was thinking the exact same thing. He started to rub his arms. Screw that place</p>

<p>Trixie got mad and threw her Gameboy at Silver, which hit him in the head. Sonic asked Twilight. I need someone to spy on Amy to see if she is going lezbo with Pinkie</p>

<p>Jet thought about this for a little while. Everyone yelled. When suddenly…Bam. she screamed. Mario said. I don&#39;t have any of my weapons and with the lack of muscles, I can&#39;t do anything.</p>

<p>There was somepony in front of him. Kiddo asked. she screamed. DX</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright flash of light knocked Tails back into Sonic. What on earth had that explosion been? He has short light blue hair, forest green eyes, and a short nose. Maybe I can call Bailey to came! You&#39;re just paranoid.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. asked a rabbit. Go on</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie were getting ready for the tie-breaker. Rainbow said. She looked purple with a single star on her flank. Calvin says. She went in one second and came out the next. However wins picks the song!</p>

<p>It was the weekend and sonic and rainbow had no plans. oh and a small one seeming to be in love with the generous aura</p>

<p>&quot;Eggman is indeed, an egg shaped man.</p>

<p>A gem brought you here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s where the Stonecutter&#39;s quill and the magic lies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve found one so far!</p>

<p>&quot;So what are we looking for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To extended our reach to the stars above.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it me, you say, you&#39;re looking forLet me show you who I am and what I have in store... Her feet with out of her shoes, which was a tell-tell sign that she wanted to play footsie. Yeah it would&#39;ve been weird enough with the two tails that mutated onto him at birth, but they were still there, just as bushy as a fox. Tails screamed.</p>

<p>The room grew silent and Sonic blushed a bit as well as Rainbow. It was Maleficent. Plus, out of all the mega blasters, I am the strongest!</p>

<p>Then another guy came floating down. Pinkie&#39;s tail started twitch again. This time it was close enough for Metal to know that it was a Phoenix of some sort.</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. I thought I wouldn&#39;t see ya again little buddy! Even Celestia saw that!</p>

<p>Rainbow, Pinkie and Applejack were having lunch at Cupcake Corner. Jet said in his screechy voice.</p>

<p>Rouge&#39;s eyes widen. As usual, Rainbow Dash got up around so she could push away some clouds before lunch. Until he gets better, I will take over the story ~mb6</p>

<p>The party cannon shot a big strawberry cake at Rainbow. There was no one in the crowd who didn&#39;t wait for a minute after the song was over before they started clapping. Everyone else turned to see what Zatch was yelling about. You go.</p>

<p>The crowd cheered and clapped</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll stick around for more of the story! By the looks on the faces back stage, there was no envy in the other contestants. Zatch and his friends and Mickey and his friends go after anything with Maleficent. Out of the shadows a blinking blue sword swung down, landing where Sonic was a second before. She jumped out of her bed to hear Twilight snoring. Luckily, Vector had tough skin so the bullets bounced off his thick skin.</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. As the speaker kept talking like rainbow, she, herself, put herself in that situation. As Applejack had said, there was nothing special although bucking season WAS coming up soon and they had so many apples that she was worried she might a have a repeat of last year…she didn&#39;t want to think about the lack of sleep she got from that season!</p>

<p>&quot;How?</p>

<p>&quot;Ok ok I get it little bro.</p>

<p>Why would I be calling you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot;</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S MY LINE!&quot;</p>

<p>The cry pierced the air as a certain pink hedgehog smashed through the already-open door and hugged Sonic, who fell over in embarrassment. Like I told the other students, find another to stay at for the next two days while we take care of the problem. Peace!</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. So he said something he didn&#39;t expect even from himself.</p>

<p>College is tough these days and sonic and rainbow knows firsthand. Suddenly her eyes drifted to the barn door and her expression turned cheerful. I HATE that song</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow weakly looked at each other. Dark green. For 2 reasons. The machine was starting to explode upon itself, starting metal to rain upon many parts of the machine that Tails knew were important for correct teleportation.</p>

<p>The time of the Double Dash has come. Dawn yelled. This is not working!</p>

<p>Then he realized what it was. Spike and Rarity says. We apologise for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>It was little above their budget but rainbow threw in some cash and they mange. He got a 60$ gift card to GameStop and a gold trophy with his name on it</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. Over next to a blue house, a rabbit decided to get some breakfast. An EGG-shaped MAN? He fell over on the soft sand. Hobbes asked. Dash mumbled.</p>

<p>Is it me, you say, you&#39;re looking forLet me show you who I am and what I have in store... You&#39;re the Italian idiotic man that keeps on interrupting 96, Unwaterd, and DemonFiccer! The echidna and the pony nodded. Tails said warmly. Soon the two of them were rushing out of the forest into the plains. She looked like she wanted to bite his face off.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that!?&quot;</p>

<p>It was Monday and the students had the day off. Then send it to us by PM, First post it on Imgur. Twilight went through that mirror once to get her tiara back from Sunset Shimmer, who came from beyond the mirror to take it for herself. Calvin said. That sounded seriously wrong, I know.</p>

<p>Silver walked into the Nurse&#39;s office and sat by Fluttershy&#39;s bed. Hello Twilight! Everywhere Dash looked, structures that were probably stable at one point were collapsing on their own weight. Sonic shouted, speeding downstairs to Tails&#39; workshop. Ganondorf music.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. Mickey lowered his head. They&#39;re good guys. With this, Tails grabbed the toaster he had made no more then 15 minutes ago and started whacking it against Sonics arm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic and Knuckles were chatting a little about the ponies in Ponyville. It was a woman with a staf. Real hard. Calvin said. Who was responsible? Trixie looked at Silver and grinned.</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. In the brushes, Amy pops her head and stares at her target. STOP GIVING HER IDEAS! Set up the big screen outside the blimp! As Sonic and Rainbow Dash arrived at her home they quickly went to bed with Sonic sleeping on the couch, but Rainbow didn&#39;t allow him to.</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow came home after they did a big portion of the project at Tails&#39; place. He charged towards Team Rocket. he asked. Everyone in the audience was cheering to their hearts content. They walked away chowing down on their meal. Toss me my cherry cola in there</p>

<p>Max engulfed Aura in a telekinetic grip that safely put him out of harms way, Sonic saw this as an opportunity to take down Eggman while he&#39;s distracted, without getting noticed he quickly used his Sonic Boost to knock the robot down to the ground. He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. Applejack almost pinned down Knuckles&#39; arm to the wooden surface of the table. They got to the parking lot when Sonic hear a crash about a mile behind him. Did you lose badly?</p>

<p>Knuckles grabbed Applejack and put her in his arms while he glided down to safety. So get over it! he yelled with joy. Wasn&#39;t that, Dad&#39;s voice?&#39; And so he decided to go see his childhood friend and little brother, but before he could start running, a giant mechanical robot appeared in front of him.</p>

<p>Sonic dashed out the door. It was more…lighter. &#39;Ah man. I&#39;ve already made reservations.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh...&quot;</p>

<p>Mind kicking Vector awake before we answer your questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, Maleficent.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anymore,&quot; Fluttershy whimpers.</p>

<p>Twilight was startled at Tails&#39; sudden outburst at the rabbit. Pinkie? yelled Shadow. Shadow make&#39;s a good drink.</p>

<p>Then another guy came floating down. After a few minutes of chatting with Sonic&#39;s new and Mobian friends, someone awoken. I have another idea!</p>

<p>Sonic takes a bit out of the cupcake and then pauses for a second. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!? WE ARE NOT IN ANY RELATIONSHIP! He couldn&#39;t come up with one on his own so easily. he yells comically. 3</p>

<p>The room grew silent and Sonic blushed a bit as well as Rainbow. She went open and took a left and heard Amy and Pinkie talking. She&#39;s pissed at you.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. a gold ring at the base, and the design of a blue stem that lead to a ring of the same color. I&#39;m sure you all are eager and excited to see your friends perform. After all, traveling through time and space can wear anyone down.</p>

<p>-back with sonic and rainbow-</p>

<p>Then he realized what it was. Or some as powerful as the emeralds. Sonic smirked at me, whilst Silver was cheering me on with the rest of the gang. Sora and Roxas pulled out their Keyblades. His Cutie Mark was a glove, like the one Silver the Hedgehog wore. Sonic felt a twinge of regret that he wasn&#39;t light enough to float on clouds so he could visit Rainbows house, but at the moment he was just glad he had a bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!</p>

<p>Dash felt something pull at her heart that made her follow him. It came from a six year old kid with black pants, red and black striped shirt, and yellow spike hair. The charged towards Bowser for attack. Everyone was dancing, eating socializing and partying like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Maleficent laughed manically. So Tails gave him the directions and Knuckles was off.</p>

<p>Cream was stuck with Vector and Espio. BTW, on 2 things. Scootaloo let Sonic go. Pinkie wanted to follow, but was pulled to the back of the lockers by Amy.</p>

<p>After Tails and Sonic&#39;s private quarrel, and Fluttershy&#39;s feeding of animals, they decided to head back to Twilights library and discuss sleeping plans. His cutie mark was two rings, like the ones that were around his front hooves interlocked on his rear. Applejack? Sonic asked with a smirk. Shadow demand in fury. By the way, I&#39;m over here by the microphone and the camera.</p>

<p>Amanda arrived at the school entrance. It didn&#39;t take long for her to charged at Sonic. It was the King of Speed himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. She took a seat directly in front of him so they can be face to face. He asked. Rainbow stood behind him, confused and a little hurt by Sonic just running off like that.</p>

<p>SRS CHAPTER IS SRS! She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. Anyways, I guess you&#39;re right…we do need a new member…we have hardly any money. Sonic said. Oswald questioned. Both of them looked at each other with creeped-out faces</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one that gives your all.</p>

<p>Just as he was drenching them in maple syrup, Knuckles and Amy wandered through the door. Wait yay!</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. I thought you, out of all of the funniest people to be around with, would go!</p>

<p>A few hours later, Tails woke up. DerpySquidsRule, Nichimon&#39;s hornless sister, compared to the Alicorn Nichie was, stared at Discord, a look of shame and pity in her eyes.</p>

<p>Scootaloo looks and sees Unknown and Amanda catching up and fast</p>

<p>Only to be greeted by a certain azure blue hedgehog.</p>

<p>&quot;AAAHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve said our goodbyes, got our…luggage… and well, I guess we&#39;re all ready to go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was a fire at Sweet Apple Acres!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where&#39;s Princess Peach?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;…Quantum Physics for ages 10 and up, I made some pancakes.</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. Robotnik gave me, I changed its programming. No poison or anything.</p>

<p>X3 Bye!</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Look out below!</h2>

<p>(If you know where I got the Name of the OC here, please tell me.</p>

<p>&quot; Is that it over there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can call me, Tailspin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hobbes, leave him alone,&quot; Calvin scolded.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Aura the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Get up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nice way of greeting somebody…&quot; Cream said.</p>

<p>&quot;I know right,&quot; Ash says.</p>

<p>&quot;Push…clouds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t really sing warmly… that well.&quot;</p>

<p>Mario asked, &quot;Why is it purple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;WOOHOOOOOO!&quot;</p>

<p>Charmy giggled and dodged a swipe from Jet&#39;s arm. Mickey lowered his head. then she looked at him. The red substance wasn&#39;t a liquid, or a solid, or even a gas, although it looked a lot like mist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. Sonic walked 5 feet close to where the sand fell. Real hard. Keio ran to the door. Can&#39;t you steer that thing?</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. &#39;Man, Shadow was right. Mickey looked at him with a cause glare. She flew in at the speed of sound. Dash said with surprise. Unfortunately, the mood was sour.</p>

<p>They arrived at Fluttershy&#39;s house and were in no way surprised to see her feeding her animals outside her house. Or maybe he becomes a super genius? Rarity, Sweetie Belle, Applebloom, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Twilight and Scootaloo. Mickey asked hugging him. YOU&#39;RE FIRED! I can&#39;t take anymore pies to the face!</p>

<p>Sonic noticed the two of them and silently awwwed in his mind. By the way, I&#39;m over here by the microphone and the camera.</p>

<p>BAD SANIK! Who are you? When that day came, she walked in and introduce herself and took a seat next to Sonic.</p>

<p>Silver and Sonic came into the club after a stop to the clinic. Knuckles was interrupted by Applejacks hoof in his mouth, and then he was pulled onto her back. What the….</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. I have got to get to the food court now, got a job there. The Chandelier. Sonic asked. RD asked. One thing first</p>

<p>Sonic was investigating the area of the fire. she said. Sonic shouted. she shouted. So tell me how are you feeling about this?</p>

<p>&quot;Jeez, Knuckles,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You already know me, I&#39;m Rainbow Dash,&quot; RD says.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, so you two have finally awoken from your unconscious state&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re ready to take em&#39; down,&quot; Bowser said.</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. Rainbow thought and began to speed up, landing into the forest itself and dodging trees with graceful ease.</p>

<p>Pinkie comes walking normally up to Sonic and Rainbow</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. Mickey thought about the dream he had. Knuckles looked apologetically at Tails.</p>

<p>&quot;How bad is what they want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twilight, you have a letter from the Princess&quot; Spike yawned</p>

<p>When Sonic took a glance at the two figures he saw a green fox with two tails, two bangs, purple eyes wearing blue shoes (similar to Sonic&#39;s) with a check mark buckle, brown shorts, a black t-shirt with white words saying, &quot; Fight for whats Right, Even if your alone&quot; he also noticed that he had a big gray scar on his left eye.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds Good?&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s a Chaos Emerald&quot; Dawn asked.</p>

<p>The day of the annual double dash has come. MOMMY!</p>

<p>Soon everyone else woke up. He had no idea where to go, he had no map so he couldn&#39;t get back to Sweet Apple Acres and to make it worse, he couldn&#39;t even talk to anyone without getting called a freak. Oh, Twilight I&#39;d like you to meet Cream. Calvin said. And Calvin was chewing on chocolate chip cookies. The team of Amy Rose and Pinkie Pie had a burnout!</p>

<p>&quot;We should really get back to the story now Shadow,&quot; Pinkie said.</p>

<p>&quot;Like addressing this… Nero Guy?&quot;</p>

<p>What a fancy seeing you here...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?!</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. It was surrounded by wires, panels, nuts and bolts and assorted other things. The green hawk pulled out a guitar from the thin air behind his back.</p>

<p>Pinkie went up to Amy and grabbed her glove, seeing a tiny needle on the index finger part of the glove.</p>

<p>Oh Christ I&#39;m getting later by the day. replied Rainbow.</p>

<p>It was the weekend and sonic and rainbow had no plans. Rainbow stood behind him, confused and a little hurt by Sonic just running off like that.</p>

<p>Speaking of the cobalt hedgehog, at this very moment he was out for his morning jog, running along a grassy land which was full of cows, pigs and other assorted animals as the morning sun, full of bright energy, crept up on the still-sleeping farm. She spun it and it landed on sonic.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t a sound in Ponyville as the sunlight rose over the horizon slowly. The gem glowed so brightly, it became white. Zatch ran to open it. Calvin said. Donald asked. It&#39;s the least I can do.</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. Even if he had no clue who she is, he felt sorry for her. The minute Sonic saved her was the minute Necromius set his sights on killing Sonic. Mickey screamed at the 2 humans and the cat. Then, the ponies saw something from it. There was nothing leading anyone to believe that it was started by a campfire, and at the time there weren&#39;t any clouds over Sweet Apple Acres, so it couldn&#39;t have been a Pegasus mistakenly causing a lightning strike.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you little twerp, we got here from some help from a friend of ours,&quot; Jessie explains to the 10 year old.</p>

<p>I know that..I just got a little excited.&quot;</p>

<p>He finally reached the spot where it landed, and was surprised to see that there was a dent in it. Sonic was knocked out and Pinkie ignored Rainbow&#39;s pleas. Last night had been a party to celebrate Ponyville&#39;s freedom-Just because they felt like it. We tried our best</p>

<p>&quot;Well?</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. Cream asked as she holds Fluttershy. Mickey asked hugging him. Our heroes jumped. He huffed and puffed heavily. Plus I will pay them back!</p>

<p>Adios!</p>

<p>Blade and Amanda was duking out, either of them was holding back. The six ponies split up in groups of two; Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy went into the Forest, Twilight and Applejack to Sweet Apple Acres and Pinkie and Rarity searched along the outskirts of town. I own nothing (BTW if you read the Shadow! Then, the ponies saw something from it. Outside, Amy and Pinkie came up to the window without the others noticing.</p>

<p>Amy said, &quot;That was hilarious.</p>

<p>&quot;My home dimension has better guards then talking mushrooms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, Mickey, and everyone else.</p>

<p>Where have you been this entire time, Mars?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We all are,&quot; Fluttershy says in her quiet voice.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. Knuckles would learn his lesson for this stupid remark in front of a unicorn by spending 3 days in hospital with a fractured skull and broken arms.</p>

<p>The Moment Sonic saw Silver and Fluttershy looking at each other like that; He noticed light warmth coming from the ring finger on his right hand. Twilight looked with surprise. IN SECOND PLACE!</p>

<p>Sonic was walking to 2nd period, with a massive headache and a member ID card in his hand. Cream said weakly, half laughing, half in tears at her demise which was soon to come.</p>

<p>SRS CHAPTER IS SRS! Megumi squealed. Dash saw it too, and it obviously scared her. I sighed, writing on a scroll, not even bothering to talk. Brock asked. Close your eyes and stick your hands out</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. He hated waiting. Ash questioned. Anyone in their way will be eliminated, that is my job. Twilight and Tails say. Rainbow dash and Sonic</p>

<p>Flutter gave Twilight a ride to the Madison Le Cruset because she didn&#39;t have a car. Hello Twilight! Real hard. Why are we here? As soon as Pinkie was about to chop off Sonic&#39;s leg, Rainbow sprung up in her bed, sweating and panting heavily. Fine then, I&#39;ll get more proof if it kills me!</p>

<p>Now everybody asks me why I&#39;m smiling out from ear to ear.</p>

<p>It took a while, however. He realized that he was looking at her too openly, and it was probably obvious what was on his mind. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>On my terms this is long (not rly lololo) but meh, It&#39;s done and I&#39;m happy! I&#39;ll just be at the apartment listening to creepypastas.</p>

<p>Sonic was investigating the area of the fire. It was a purple emerald. sonic</p>

<p>Now everybody asks me why I&#39;m smiling out from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Silver closes the door and Sonic ran to Tails&#39; place. Applejack said, and got into a sprinting pose.</p>

<p>A little later Shadow brought Sonic up to speed (No pun intended) on the situation that brought them to Canterlot City. Out of the shadows a blinking blue sword swung down, landing where Sonic was a second before. She didn&#39;t think Tails would actually compliment her on her logic. Amy was winning at first.</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. Tia and Zatch asked. Sonic smirked at me, whilst Silver was cheering me on with the rest of the gang. So thank you. Sonic was destroyed.</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. And Calvin was chewing on chocolate chip cookies. Rainbow said. Well, I&#39;m writing that part</p>

<p>Pinkie took the bag and sat on it. Peach ran to the nearest door, but was grabbed by Bowser. Tails landed with a loud BAM on the sand. Bowser said. Silver, home to the Pokémon master. Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>Before the seven of them knew what on earth the thing was, it stared to suck all of them in. I can&#39;t see!</p>

<p>-ahead of them-</p>

<p>Later on that day, everyone was working in the gym for the open mic night. Mickey thought. Twilight and Tails say. Her hair was streaked rainbow but it was obviously natural. Maleficent laughed manically. No poison or anything.</p>

<p>Sonic&#39;s mind swelled with rage. They took seats next to their friends. So please come quickly.</p>

<p>Sonic was interrupted by a flash in the sky. When he spread his wings the feathers of ravens that felt sharp as a knife. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. It came from a light purple unicorn. I&#39;m sure you all are eager and excited to see your friends perform. This is why I don&#39;t go to those types of parties!</p>

<p>&quot;And we&#39;re here for a reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks Twilight.</p>

<p>&quot;Hobbes, leave him alone,&quot; Calvin scolded.</p>

<p>Who IS that saying everything we do!?&quot;</p>

<p>Tails and knuckles passed the line into their 4th lap. Dash saw it too, and it obviously scared her. They walked away chowing down on their meal. I&#39;m trying to fix it.</p>

<p>-Meanwhile, on Mt. It was raining chocolate milk. A dinosaur and 2 Italian man. But there was something else to it that she just knew was there, she could see it, just feel it. She started to sob with tears streaming down her light blue face. People are trying to sleep!</p>

<p>Sonic woke up on the roof of a building. Let&#39;s go! Dash was as happy as she could get, and then Pinkie Pie came around.</p>

<p>Applejack gave a weary sigh and started on her way to the Ponyville Hospital, or as it was known by Knuckles, &quot;Hell&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One of your most beloved worlds will get it.</p>

<p>Continuing on! She pulled out a cyan blue jewel. community college. This blade was passed down from generation to generation by my family.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jet was confused at the fact that there were ponies around. Rouge put her ear to the door, but heard nothing. Dawn asked. It can be found by a fable call Stonecutter. What happened to our project?!</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie were getting ready for the tie-breaker. It was Livin la vida loca by Ricky Martin. Falgore screamed. With me, I have the co-principle and co-host, Luna.</p>

<p>Uh…ok! SONIC! Bowser quickly lowered his head and spit out a fire ball. Now we need a tie breaker!</p>

<p>Little did the hedgehog know he was being followed by a madman waiting to ambush his speedy foe. Suddenly a yellow mouse with a lightning bolt tail jumped out of the boy&#39;s backpack. I just ate some disguising food in the cafeteria and some retard spilled mustard on my dress! At least their classes are like 30 minutes each. So thank you. They call me the Godfa-</p>

<p>Well I think I did a bit ok on my first time publishing a fanfic. The DJ put the song on and Rarity begun to snap her fingers to the beat and started humming. The rest of his body looked like a regular unicorn&#39;s, with hair that went in three spikes in front of him and mane white as the tip of his tails. She easily opens it and climbs in there. They started to run, but was sucked in. And a Pink hedgehog?</p>

<p>He froze to his chair, his fur straight up. He didn&#39;t have a grudge for Wave but that fact that she annoyed him back when Extreme Gear racing was a way of earning a little money still set him off a bit.</p>

<p>She paid for it and the shopkeeper took it back to get it ready for Twilight&#39;s big night. Both of them looked at each other with creeped-out faces</p>

<p>&quot;I know everything,&quot; Sonic says.</p>

<p>&quot;Here are my new friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, it at least gives me a chance on getting to know you better&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, shorty, we have no idea to any of your questions so if you could SHUT UP for a couple of hours that&#39;d do us JUST FINE!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You said Bowser is there to kidnap Peach again.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi guys, what did I miss?&quot;</p>

<p>Uh…ok! replied Twilight</p>

<p>Eggman&#39;s machine shot out rockets and lasers aiming at the three heroes. As Sonic opened his eyes agonizingly, he realized that he was sitting on top of a tree. he said. I got everything down. YOU MONTSER!</p>

<p>Knuckles and Rouge was at the door in a new look and Amy didn&#39;t notice them. Calvin said. NO! Tails walked over to the kitchen sink, and opened the fridge next to it. They were clapping along as wildly as the audience.</p>

<p>Applejack gave a weary sigh and started on her way to the Ponyville Hospital, or as it was known by Knuckles, &quot;Hell&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought Dashy was the only one who could do that.&quot;</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. How on earth did they get here?</h2>

<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my first EVAR fan-fiction!</p>

<p>A portal had opened, in the sky letting two figures fall down through it one of them was conscious enough to realize that they were going to crash into a castle he looked to his side and noticed that Sonic was knocked out.</p>

<p>At this moment in time, Pinkie and Rarity had just had an unfortunate encounter with a pony who had started rambling on about economics and poverty and whatnot. No.</p>

<p>&quot;Dose this answer your question?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok, thanks Twilight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell Sweetie Belle &#39;that was an incredible performance,&#39;&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Sonic says &quot;It&#39;s so on lady!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My friends and I repents the Elements of Harmony.</p>

<p>She gave a small squeal of fright. They were also stomping the beat of We Will Rock You. So tell me how are you feeling about this?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tails and Twilight were strolling around outside. I want you guys to draw us a picture of your favorite scene of this story. said yet another alicorn. It took a long time to introduce everyone and explain everything. He saw some people waking up. Few minutes later, Tails arrived in his car, looking fancy.</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. Sorr….hey, are you Blade?</p>

<p>-on the track-</p>

<p>Everyone was just awestruck. Hey! Sonic went back Trixie&#39;s house and knocked on the door, with Silver answering it.</p>

<p>Sonic clicked on the video and it began playing. She had indigo fur and a moon image on her flank. Hobbes was reading a comic book. The kid with a backpack is Ash. Go on</p>

<p>As the curtains rised, the audience was greeted to the singer&#39;s backs. And it&#39;s summer. He asked. Shadow asked. Tails and Cream clapped.</p>

<p>Cream sighed. She talked pretty fast. It was worth it! We need it!</p>

<p>Good point. Wave shouted. But there was something else to it that she just knew was there, she could see it, just feel it. Everyone went silent.</p>

<p>The race is almost underway and the interviews are over. just as Scootaloo said it, an image of a scooter with a helmet on the handle appeared on her flank.</p>

<p>The night quickly came and everyone arrived. Dash demanded. Dash demanded. Tried to put that up with my mind!</p>

<p>Rainbow was in the bathroom, pooping her heart out. Even Sonic would admit that he did look at Dash every now and then on the way to school. What about you? And by that I mean he charged at Metal, who just raised his hoof and punched him into the mirror behind him. However wins picks the song!</p>

<p>&quot;Now imagine that power times 7, but with all the positive energy.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be too worried Tails.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>What a fancy seeing you here...&quot;</p>

<p>Amanda arrived at the school entrance. I was winning!</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. Our heroes jumped. Don&#39;t talk about…..uh-oh not again! The two were blinded by all the bright lights and the attractions the city had to offer. Not for me .</p>

<p>Mario and Luigi</p>

<p>Sonic focused his mind around the spotlight and it was engulfed with light blue aura. You ready?</p>

<p>Twilight agreed with Tails and they headed back to the library as quick as they could.</p>

<p>She pulled a basket filled with rainbow cupcakes. Rainbow had to wonder how Sonic&#39;s new body was going. He told Dash&#39;s parents that his parents died the night before. Knuckles had to introduce himself to Applejack before he started or he would probably be in court for defacing others property. asked a rabbit. I know you can do better!</p>

<p>The audience and the racers clapped and cheered for the kids. Maybe he can work at the nearby bakery&#39; Sonic though. Her feet with out of her shoes, which was a tell-tell sign that she wanted to play footsie. They belong to their owners.</p>

<p>Tails told her about the Chaos Emeralds and Super Sonic. The engine was working fine a minute ago! Meanwhile, Tails and Twilight tried to use their evidence they had gathered so far (Two Chaos Emeralds and Two Explosions) to try and piece together what was going on with the failed experiment.</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. As usual, the ponies got up one by one, drowsily after the night they just had. Everyone suddenly went skyrocketing to the sky. Ash questioned. This meant that the Power of Earth had been restored to Chaos, only two more emeralds to go.</p>

<p>There was something about this Sonic guy that Dash just found interesting. PEOPLE ARE PASSING US!</p>

<p>Everyone already signed up the Kart race. SHADOW! It worked! She ordered few treats for her friends and a rainbow cupcake for herself. They only reason they are going to see him is to have a Pokémon battle with him. Evil Aaron is EVIL!</p>

<p>They both looked at Tails&#39; modern styled house. Rainbow had it. Mickey asked. He had no idea where to go, he had no map so he couldn&#39;t get back to Sweet Apple Acres and to make it worse, he couldn&#39;t even talk to anyone without getting called a freak. Out of nowhere a portal opened. He started wandering around Ponyville until he ran into a few familiar faces.</p>

<p>&quot;GO!&quot;</p>

<p>Uh…ok! Bear in mind that I am not a brony and six is not a pegasister so rainbow and her friends might be OOC. She felt giddy and happy and…</p>

<p>Shadow was looking at an empty plate. For all anypony knew, it could be Discord causing chaos. He looked down at the crème filling that was oozing out. Wave shouted. The judges tally their scores.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. She looked purple with a single star on her flank. the woman said. I cannot focus at all with my wings popping out at random times. Yes I am getting it for the 3ds.</p>

<p>Rainbow helped sonic of the rainbow and the two returned to the Dorm. There was plush chairs and a Television and even some grape soda. she shouted. We have somewhat similar writing styles, except she adds humor to hers. I&#39;ll explain later. I won&#39;t make you into a cupcake!</p>

<p>Twilight had arrived back to her house. Luigi ran, jumped, and punched the ball back. She was talking with Ash. We will be back in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. Pinkie pulled something out of her settle bag. Each fanfic writers always changes something here and there, it what give fics a little extra kick in quality. The employee with her order was approaching to the master room (because she was VIP) As he walked up the door, he heard moaning coming from inside. The members of the club went to the observation window but they can&#39;t hear what Silver and Sonic are saying.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Calvin told Susie.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that seriously his name?</p>

<p>&quot;FIND THE COMPUTER ROOOOOOM!&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone, even the other racers, laughed at Celestia&#39;s joke. Or maybe that was his Equestrian Avatar, because it was a blue colt with a red tail with a white stripe halfway between the tip and his flank. Mario asked. And her voice was coder then a winter&#39;s night. What about you? We doing great!</p>

<p>Everyone was just awestruck. Zatch asked. They never really went on holidays anyways so that was the number one reason. Amy replied and bounced off happy as ever. Tails let everyone else walk in while he typed in some numbers to a console on the side of the door. Even me and Luna are anxious to see the winners!</p>

<p>They both headed downstairs to check on Tails&#39; experiments. Sora asked slamming the door open. Susie looked down to see the stream glowing bright red. Mewoth demeaned. It was the last thing Mario heard before everything went black.</p>

<p>Sonic called Dominos but couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Rainbow. His hair was Spiky and styled going up and out. I have got to get to the food court now, got a job there. Shadow then looked at the ceiling trying to find me. Wait, she won&#39;t make it in time. Oh, hey guys!</p>

<p>Knuckles, who had been lazing around for most of the day, was woken by a moaning Appljeack. She can tell Mickey would tell them something heartbreaking. Originally Vector was going to check and see if there was any note they had missed saying where they had gone or what they were going to do, but Cream had begged to come along as there really was nothing to do without any of her friends around. HA! Pinkie screamed, and woke both of them up. You guys made it!</p>

<p>Rainbow can obviously tell that she was lying</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. The two best buddies dashed downstairs. Vector shouted at Sonic.</p>

<p>Flutter walk to Pinkie&#39;s house and knocked on the door. Everything is the same except that Oswald and Roxas now have hearts, which will be explained later on. Mickey asked hugging him. You can do this. Sonic almost ran into several trees as his brain worked to try and figure out what these pony things were. He made a mental note to eat some chocolate next to Sonic…in a locked room.</p>

<p>DONE DONE DONE HMMMM YES. Trixie? He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. Rainbow was startled by Vector&#39;s scream and hid behind Espio for support. As for the other figure, it was a Dark Red hedgehog with all quills pointing up, dark blue eyes, wearing a black shirt with a white sleeveless hoodie on top, black pants, black converse (having the same function as Sonic&#39;s shoes), and white fingerless gloves.</p>

<p>&quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where am I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Sonic, Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re still at the base getting ready,&quot; Sally answered.</p>

<p>Twilight blushed at this statement. With cyan blue skin/fur, a lighting butt tattoo, and wings. It was also catching up to him at an amazing speed, so Sonic turned around and decided to boost his speed up. I guess it&#39;s been a long time anyways. He put down his laptop on the table and carried rainbow to her bed then he went to bed.</p>

<p>&quot;What… about yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really fast!</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. She was to perform on stage and she was running late. It had curved windows and a sleek polyester design which made the entire place reflect the sun. I never realized how soft her skin is. NO TIME FOR REVIEW ANSWERS, LET&#39;S GET STUCK IIIIN</p>

<p>&quot;I…think I found one of the emeralds.</p>

<p>&quot;But…but it went up my…!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now we need to give this form a name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OHHHH!</p>

<p>&quot;My tail is twitching again.</p>

<p>&quot;I bet you 15…uh…&#39;bits&#39; that I can clear 10 trees faster then you can!</p>

<p>Rainbow went into the bathroom and brought out a mini flashlight. So Sonic did the most natural thing he could think of. she said. Oh! Riddles shock his head. They hit land safely.</p>

<p>It was the weekend and sonic and rainbow had no plans. Kiyo did a face palm. When he got a look at the girl, his face probably would&#39;ve been priceless. He sighed to himself. Once the great and mighty Trixie beat him, Trixie will get the respect she deserves!</p>

<p>-WE INTERRUPT THIS EXTREMEMLY IMPORTANT PLOT POINT FOR A USELESS AND BORING AD-</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?</p>

<p>Mario runs to the fridge and pulls out a bag full of garlic</p>

<p>Sonic did as he was told and felt a small box in his hands</p>

<p>Applejack watched from the side-lines as Tails and Twilight geeked over each others technological knowledge. Aura asked out of nowhere</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. She&#39;s pissed at you.</p>

<p>Amy tasted the cupcake and her pupils started to dilate. Using all the strength I had, I burst with energy, sending baldy nose hair far away. Suddenly Zatch felt a breeze of wind behind him. Sonic&#39;s voice came squeaking out.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s up bro?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here are my new friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; they both said at the same time.</p>

<p>Sonic took that rather nicely. He was wearing jeans and a red t-shirt with a belt and a ring. I have a line of plot in my head that I&#39;m going to be following along, and if it goes as I like it then I MIGHT include some OC&#39;s, not for the moment however.</p>

<p>&quot;If anything I&#39;m trying to save this place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before, I flood this place with tears, Zatch and Kieo, how did you get here?&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s th-&quot; Charmy said almost in a Pinkie Pie sugar-buzz way.</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>Sonic got back to Tails&#39; house where he and Knuckles were waiting for him. How are you doing?! He smiled at Twilight.</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. It looked like it was made of silver. Them got up to a cliff and took a breather.</p>

<p>&quot;Hugh, my head…&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p>Rainbow went into the bathroom and brought out a mini flashlight. Soon after, he excused himself to bed. Scootaloo asked. Bowser said. PEOPLE ARE PASSING US!</p>

<p>Sonic realized that this was the third body he had, and possibly the third name. He yelled. Rainbow cried. But she was completely thrown off by his answer.</p>

<p>She is SMOKING!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just hope Princess Celestia knows what danger we&#39;re all in,&quot; She says.</p>

<p>&quot;We ran into the enemies of Ash and Sonic.</p>

<p>&quot;And as you asked SO NICELY, I might as well tell you!</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,ew where did that come from?&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic was attending central middle school and got news that a new girl was transferring to his home room from Cloudsdale. Kiddo asked. We don&#39;t even have a robot to work on! I came from a man with red and blue shirt and overalls. Due to her lack of muscles, Amy struggled to keep everything from hitting the ground (there were shopping carts, but Amy didn&#39;t notice them XD)</p>

<p>There was a knocking at the door. Amy almost shouted as squealed and ran back and forth to try and bake the sugary delight.</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie drooled.</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack slowly trotted into the barn and gasped when they found a yellow fox sitting on a bale of hay, nursing one of his two tails. Calvin asked. Instead of catching them, they got hit in the head by it. Suddenly Zatch felt a breeze of wind behind him. Cream shyed away a little, almost mocking Fluttershy, then mumbled.</p>

<p>Cream stared at him. Ash asked. No one calls me emo. Remember last time you got on stage alone?</p>

<p>Both of them started attacking the door on one spot</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. OhnoohnoOHNOOHNOOOOOOOO!</h2>

<p>Necromius disappeared when it became apparent that Sonic had more help than before.</p>

<p>Only to be greeted by a certain azure blue hedgehog.</p>

<p>The bell ringed and everyone put their robots in the storage room. There was something in his eyes that looked odd, like he was willing her to wake up. The charged towards Bowser for attack. Pinkie said. By the way, we do not own the songs that are about to play. she repeated more strictly.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. One of the strangest things is that Hobbes is alive. The two ponies and the fox had worked out their differences and now it seemed as if Tails and Twilight had more in common then the eye meets. Probably will submit the next one today. Rarity replied.</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie drooled.</p>

<p>Sonic clicked on the video and it began playing. I bet Rarity can get you something. He will reappear. APPLEJACK!</p>

<p>&quot;HAH, Gotcha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, at least I didn&#39;t build the rest of the scenery,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;OHHHH!</p>

<p>&quot;PIKACHU!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, girls?</p>

<p>&quot;How?</p>

<p>Strange, it&#39;s blue, not green.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok enough of the competition talk we have a serious situation here that needs an explanation!&quot;</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie arrived in Diamond city. She was whispering something to Pinkie, so quietly not even I could hear. You took off like you just seen a ghost! You really don&#39;t know by now? Riddles said. Her mane and tail were straight and had a highlight the color of her fur while the rest was violet.</p>

<p>A discounted WiiU 220$</p>

<p>&quot;Ok, Princess Celestia were ready&quot; Twilight said feeling a bit more comfortable</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Ash, would you like to go next?&quot;</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. Bear in mind that I am not a brony and six is not a pegasister so rainbow and her friends might be OOC. ^^</p>

<p>&quot;No means no, little lady.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t like that to Fluttershy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just hope Princess Celestia knows what danger we&#39;re all in,&quot; She says.</p>

<p>&quot;B-but…&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine, why wouldn&#39;t we be?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing YOU were randomly teleported here too?&quot;</p>

<p>And Amy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yup and from what I can tell your pretty fast yourself&quot;</p>

<p>I read a little about the fox yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>And who are YOU?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright flash of light knocked Tails back into Sonic. Shout a female voice. Mario turned around. GIVE ME THE WHEEL!</p>

<p>She saw Sonic in her dreams. She could get in the way of Tails, and then she would be left alone, with no partn-</p>

<p>Racing day is tomorrow and Amanda wants to be in it, but have no partner. Just saying.</p>

<p>Blade and Amanda was duking out, either of them was holding back. Mickey&#39;s eyes shrunk. You need and two-person kart to race</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic had stopped directly in the centre of Ponyville after a mad race through Equestria trying to lose Amy. Megumi asked. Everyone turned to Sonic. There was no one in the crowd who didn&#39;t wait for a minute after the song was over before they started clapping. Since she worked for G.U.N for a part time job, she is a expert spy. Scootaloo said.</p>

<p>Amy had also woken up with a start and almost pulled out her Piko Piko Hammer until she realised these ponies carried no threat. Spike? Like I told the other students, find another to stay at for the next two days while we take care of the problem. he was about as tall as Sonic. We love him</p>

<p>There was a hard banging on the door. It will be like Mario Kart Double Dash</p>

<p>Both girls pushed their opponent&#39;s hand with all of their strength. Sonic smiled. Amy and Pinkie simply screamed at the incoming bomb. This meant that the Power of Earth had been restored to Chaos, only two more emeralds to go.</p>

<p>As he was told, Tails started his teleportation device as it was powering up, as soon as it was powering up the drone started to sabotage the device making it go haywire and malfunctioning. The version of me as of right now belongs to LittleKurbio/CardGamesFTW due to I am in my abridged version.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Applejack and Twilight had arrived at the farm. He was wearing jeans and a red t-shirt with a belt and a ring. And really he couldn&#39;t come up with anything better to call himself than that.</p>

<p>&quot;OH NO YOU DON&#39;T!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Amy, chill!</p>

<p>&quot;Oh it was nothing,&quot; Tails rubbed the back of his head and blushed.</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. Sonic looked behind him and there was that monster sized contraption of military insanity he already saw twice now. OH! From what I knew, no one was awake when we were teleported. Wave replied.</p>

<p>&quot;What now, hater?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is stranger then the Bilolizard&quot; Sonia said.</p>

<p>A discounted WiiU 220$</p>

<p>Mrs. Seven is trying to find someone to make the box art for his game.</p>

<p>-Later-</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Tails came out with their orders</p>

<p>WHAT are you!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet you 15…uh…&#39;bits&#39; that I can clear 10 trees faster then you can!</p>

<p>well lets see&quot; Twilight said taking the letter with her magic</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s where the Stonecutter&#39;s quill and the magic lies.&quot;</p>

<p>Max engulfed Aura in a telekinetic grip that safely put him out of harms way, Sonic saw this as an opportunity to take down Eggman while he&#39;s distracted, without getting noticed he quickly used his Sonic Boost to knock the robot down to the ground. Suddenly he fell over. Maybe he needed to wash. She flew around at supersonic speed (she accidently charged at 5 people, causing them to wake up) to see where she was. Right now, he felt like he was going to burst with the pressure of cider.</p>

<p>You and your egghead friend can sit around reading books all day and Sonic can just run around like he always does but what am I supposed to do?&quot;</p>

<p>And if they want to expand their empire, they&#39;ll take over the world outside of the park.&quot;</p>

<p>Why did he ask for this?&quot;</p>

<p>Strange, it&#39;s blue, not green.&quot;</p>

<p>Vector let out a cry and a shout. Metal Sonic got Intel from Chrysalis that basically said that something on this side of the mirror was going to break it, and destroy all the worlds on both sides. She put the chocolate powder into a cup of tea, knowing from the morning before that this was the drink he preferred.</p>

<p>The two went to the back of the school, where the Pokémon Club was held at. But before he can run, a pink hedgehog with a red dress and pretty emerald eyes dog piled Sonic. He started to rub his arms. I GOT IT! Amy was startled and slopped coffee all down her front. The version of me as of right now belongs to LittleKurbio/CardGamesFTW due to I am in my abridged version.)</p>

<p>Cream and Vector had headed for Sonic and Tails&#39; house. Her eyes were watering. But it was too late. The portal started to close! Suddenly Zatch felt a breeze of wind behind him. I&#39;m just staying here for tonight then it&#39;s back out for me.</p>

<p>Blade and Amanda was duking out, either of them was holding back. Is Sonic your friend? It looked like it was made of silver. Vector stated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. Twilight said inquisitively. Sonic looked at his new surprised friends. But suddenly, Sonic saw the Ponyville Hospital Wards and, knowing Knuckles was in there, ran inside.</p>

<p>Both of them held the trophy up. Trixie pulled on her grapping hook to get them to safer grounds. Rainbow said. Wasn&#39;t that, Dad&#39;s voice?&#39; She ran into the gym and took a seat next to silver.</p>

<p>rainbow came home but haven&#39;t seen Sonic since this morning, until she saw him coming out of Mario&#39;s apartment.</p>

<p>Tails moaned. She flew around at supersonic speed (she accidently charged at 5 people, causing them to wake up) to see where she was. Spike and Rarity says. They need some time.</p>

<p>Oops! It had a blue stone in the ground. Knuckles is up then Applejack then Tails and Twilight. I thought you will just make me do your chores or something</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow came home after they did a big portion of the project at Tails&#39; place. The small boy with golden hair and was with that older kid is Zatch and Keio. &#39;I wonder if these people have any food around here. I, anlong with my friends try to stop the evil Dr. I looked Around, to see a dragon type thing, with different types of wings, different types of horns, a goats beard and different types of legs.</p>

<p>Sonic moved. But her shock looked different, like he figured out something that would&#39;ve been impossible to know, just by looking at someone. Maleficent laughed manically. Rainbow Dash turned around and saw one of her friends, Twilight Sparkle. They need some time.</p>

<p>Now obviously, he never brought his cellphone while running as it could slip out of his hands quite easily (where else could he put it?) but he had to today, as Tails would have no way of contacting him unless he did. It was a purple emerald. According to eyewitnesses, the explosion lasted maybe only 3 to 5 seconds, which wasn&#39;t that interesting.</p>

<p>The cry pierced the air as a certain pink hedgehog smashed through the already-open door and hugged Sonic, who fell over in embarrassment. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. Knuckles jumped up and gave a startled cry at the two ponies who had just appeared in front of them.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Tails woke up. Sonic asked. They were seated in the balcony with a wonderful view of the city and parts of Diamond city.</p>

<p>Tails moaned. Mario said. Sora asked slamming the door open. For 2 reasons. Sonic shouted. Sonic was speechless.</p>

<p>Before the seven of them knew what on earth the thing was, it stared to suck all of them in. Sonic yelled. We are supposed to have an open-mike night. Cake, Amy and Pinkie were in charge of food and drinks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tails and Twilight were strolling around outside. They took a step near a window and began to talk. Keio ran to the door. Twilight said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Rainbow went to the food stand to grab some snacks. the girl asked. They had come here to make sure that nothing had harmed the animal-at this point in time they never knew if space debris could fly out of the explosion at any time.</p>

<p>Twilight stared at Cream in disgust. Knuckles said wearily. Shout a female voice. People were seriously getting down. The red jewel fell in, and the portal closed.</p>

<p>Fluttershy ran over and almost keeled over when she noticed a fox and two hedgehogs as big as she was. Let&#39;s start off me. Ash answered. They looked at her, and despair washed over their faces. TELL ME!</p>

<p>&quot;So Sonic,&quot; her mom said at dinner that night.</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. Twilight stumbled over the last word. James said. Sure enough, after an hour of events, such as…</p>

<p>&quot;In my room&quot; Sonic blushed at that.&quot;Are you sure &#39;cause I&#39;m fine on a couch&quot; Sonic said trying to get out of sleeping on the same bed with a pony.&quot;Yes ,I&#39;m sure now come on&quot;</p>

<p>At this moment in time, Pinkie and Rarity had just had an unfortunate encounter with a pony who had started rambling on about economics and poverty and whatnot. Tails walked over to the kitchen sink, and opened the fridge next to it. When that day came, she walked in and introduce herself and took a seat next to Sonic.</p>

<p>Rainbow looked at Knuckles with fear. Twilight&#39;s horn glowed, getting for some kind of fighting spell. Sonic yelled. Then the figure holding the Sword came out of hiding, like a chameleon showing itself, from its hiding spot.</p>

<p>Oh Christ I&#39;m getting later by the day. That was where Rainbow had to say something.</p>

<p>Like I said to all you idiots,</p>

<p>Trixie got mad and threw her Gameboy at Silver, which hit him in the head. I am just hoping he will be alright. Later that night, Sonic, Rainbow and Twilight was playing a game of Monopoly. She had light blue, small nose, and a long pinkish purple hair that reaches all the way to her wrist. He adored these hills, just outside Tails and Sonic&#39;s houses, as they weren&#39;t inhabited by any creature or animal, so Sonic could run around all he wanted without disrupting anyone or anything. Suddenly he started to sing, and Cream watched, wondering what on earth was going on…</p>

<p>Sonic got back to Tails&#39; house where he and Knuckles were waiting for him. After a few minutes of chatting with Sonic&#39;s new and Mobian friends, someone awoken. Is it. Scootaloo yelled. You seem so familiar it aint even funny.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous summer day. She went open and took a left and heard Amy and Pinkie talking. No poison or anything.</p>

<p>I am requesting that you gather your friends and come to Canterlot immediately, I do not know if the situation is an emergency, but you must come here right now, there are these two creatures that seem to be hedgehogs, they just came out of nowhere and crashed into the throne room, I wonder if Fluttershy will be able to calm them down if they get out of control. Knuckles took control and run into Twilight&#39;s kart. Susie asked as she put the dishes in sink. I don&#39;t want it to happen again!</p>

<p>Tails was definitely amazed by his abilities.&quot;You&#39;re not kidding when you can tell peoples emotions&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rainbow Dash said.</p>

<p>&quot;And you!</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah… it really is you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,ew where did that come from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?</p>

<p>&quot;I made a promise to not use my Element against Discord.</p>

<p>Oh well, the more the merrier I guess….&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scootaloo, Applebloom, Sweetie Belle,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I just don&#39;t l-like it here that&#39;s al-AGH!&quot;</p>

<p>THAT CAT JUST TALKED!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dad?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also able to focus my own aura to attack enemies&quot; He explained while his aura flared around is body</p>

<p>Our love will never die</p>

<p>Both of them went to their own rooms. That and they want a break. Sonic walked 5 feet close to where the sand fell. Fine then, I&#39;ll get more proof if it kills me!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Vector did not know that Tails had installed mini-turrets to go off if a biological being went through the window. I&#39;m a super-fast blue hedgehog inspired by Michel Jackson and Santa Clause for my foot wear. It will be a bumpy ride but we&#39;ll have our fun along the way x3 The bottom of each story will always be my Authors note so make sure to read it! Discord... She pulled out a cyan blue jewel. So Tails gave him the directions and Knuckles was off.</p>

<p>He dun goofed XD</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Told us what?</h2>

<p>Hello, and welcome back to The Pony Parable.</p>

<p>Rainbow wrote her address on a sheet of paper and hand it to Sonic. It had a big carrier device in the middle that could easily fit 7-10 people. Twilight said inquisitively. she asked.</p>

<p>After this…serious character development, Tails, Twilight and a thoroughly frightened Cream pushed their way through a swarm of ponies and reached Fluttershys cottage. They share apartments and share the same mean, ugly teachers who constantly gives their students (most partially sonic and rainbow) projects after projects, testes after testes. He creates robots out of poor baby animals, we call them Flickies, and then he sets them free. YOU TWO GET BACK HERE! Let&#39;s get practicing! I&#39;m paying!</p>

<p>The Egg Mecha quickly grabbed Sonic before he could get away. He has short light blue hair, forest green eyes, and a short nose. Ash questioned. Dawn yelled. He also had a lion paw, an eagle claw, a deer leg and horn, a lizard leg, a goat antler, a big bat wing, a Pegasus wing, a short beard, a snake tongue, a eyes with yellow where the white should be and red pupils. all rights goes to their respective owners!</p>

<p>Speaking of the cobalt hedgehog, at this very moment he was out for his morning jog, running along a grassy land which was full of cows, pigs and other assorted animals as the morning sun, full of bright energy, crept up on the still-sleeping farm. Amy said. She said.</p>

<p>Twilight ran to the bathroom to splash some water on her face. But…I could try to build a friendship. Everyone laughs. Rouge had dyed her hair a whiteish-gary color, had pink eye liner, wearing a plain dirndl (sorry if you can&#39;t pronounce this words, Seven is taking German) and had high-heels.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow weakly looked at each other. he yells comically. they yelled. Tails groaned. Does he owe you money? let Amy pay</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll stick around for more of the story! Rainbow said. Rainbow Dash asked. Twilight was saved in answering her question by another loud knock on the door.</p>

<p>By the way guys. A figure was appearing from the blinding sight. You&#39;re the Italian idiotic man that keeps on interrupting 96, Unwaterd, and DemonFiccer! Wario? I want to give her something</p>

<p>&quot;Shadow...</p>

<p>One more member means lots more loot!&quot;</p>

<p>well lets see&quot; Twilight said taking the letter with her magic</p>

<p>Sonic realized that this was the third body he had, and possibly the third name. Tails started but before he could finish he was interrupted by a large bang that occurred outside the machine. a gold ring at the base, and the design of a blue stem that lead to a ring of the same color. Mario nodded. Mario came in and was greeted by a bucket of water on his head.</p>

<p>Sonic took a quick look behind him and gasped to see the pony…flying? She hollered. And to those who don&#39;t know, when a character talks like this, their thinking.</p>

<p>Like before, there was a red flash and what looked like an explosion in the sky. But…what was it? Cream started to unknot the tails of Tails. hollered a voice. Sonic said. It was Discord, the spirit of Chaos and Disharmony.</p>

<p>He looked at the voice and saw a white unicorn with wings… no alicorn. Sonic told his friends, &#39;Let&#39;s check it out. Mickey thought. Rainbow followed him, although she was stunned. After 5 minutes of chatting. You seem so familiar it aint even funny.</p>

<p>Sonic smiles and gets up letting out a chuckle readying himself for a good smack down, as the allies get ready Eggman was up and furious to see his chance of ending the annoying hedgehog slip away. Sonic, little help! Shadow slapped Sonic in the head. Mario yelled. he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;How on earth did they get here?&quot;</p>

<p>Mario asked, &quot;Why is it purple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now just feel the energy inside&quot;</p>

<p>When Rainbow made it to her room, she closed the door and burst laughing for a good 5 minutes. I HATE that song</p>

<p>Both Sonic and Aura started laughing when Eggman was about to burst into a fit of rage</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow Dash looked at the others feeling embarrassed they both looked at each other in agreement to save the chatting for later</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to tell you and didn&#39;t listen,&quot; Sonic told him.</p>

<p>I LOVE IT!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look Rainbow, I just really don&#39;t like the forest it kinda…creeps me out a li-WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who are the Overtakers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it would be in our best interest to seek out the Dreamers.&quot;</p>

<p>While the fox, hedgehog, unicorn and Pegasus were figuring out the events that could have led up to the finding of not one but two chaos emeralds, Amy, who was grumpy for not being mentioned in the story a lot (not that anyone cared) was storming around the town of Ponyville. He slowly got up and wobbled a little. Suddenly her eyes drifted to the barn door and her expression turned cheerful. The scientist saw him coming and fired a large beam at him, making Aura jump into the air.</p>

<p>After all the animals had been checked and found NOT to be traumatised by Fluttershy, the four of them set off to Sugarcube Corner to make sure everything was alright. When he spread his wings the feathers of ravens that felt sharp as a knife. And how beautiful her hair is….</p>

<p>Tails bounced around a bit. Both of them looked at each other with creeped-out faces</p>

<p>&quot;I had some business to take care of in the next town,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some extra beds I have that they can use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh that, Princess Celestia said I can switched between alicorn and unicorn.</p>

<p>Sonic was investigating the area of the fire. She got the idea. Tails says. If we do this thing successful, we can get the scope on Amy and Pinkie. Everyone laughed. Why?</p>

<p>-Meanwhile in Eque-OK,you know the drill by now-</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. said a voice. We are falling behind!</p>

<p>Vinyl throws it on and the music starts. I&#39;m Amy. Before we head by to our own places, how about we stop at the Drink Stop? Celestia had finished the letter and sent it to a little town called Ponyville.</p>

<p>There was something about this Sonic guy that Dash just found interesting. The girl looked something like Dash. Cameras and video crew have came to record this amazing event. Going to the dentist tomorrow.</p>

<p>&quot;OK, now who are you going to stay with Aura?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How many have you had!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>&quot;Last time my Pinkie sense said something that big, Twilight started believing it,&quot; Pinkie said.</p>

<p>Rainbow Dash here didn&#39;t BOTHER to tell me…&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>My tail is twitching!&quot;</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. ~mb7</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Mickey!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I was to say no?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, rise up&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An emerald?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Mickey began.</p>

<p>&quot;She&#39;s the one who nurses me and to be honest, first time I was brought in here it looked as if she wanted to call a VET instead of a doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess you&#39;d like to know where we are?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Roxas!</p>

<p>&quot;So uh…have you noticed how everyone here is a pony?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OH GOD CREAM I DON&#39;T KNOW!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok then sugarcube lets get going to Sweet Apple Acres&quot;</p>

<p>Mind kicking Vector awake before we answer your questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How are you, you so called leader?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic?</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should turn the sand into ice.</p>

<p>Trixie got mad and threw her Gameboy at Silver, which hit him in the head. sonic</p>

<p>&quot;This is pathetic!</p>

<p>&quot;As in, it looks dilapidated?</p>

<p>&quot;Mickey, can I ask you something,&quot; Twilight asked.</p>

<p>That Knuckles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This world will end in fire,&quot; Knuckles said absently.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on!?&quot;</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles slid into the mud. said Twilight. She had light blue, small nose, and a long pinkish purple hair that reaches all the way to her wrist. READ IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

<p>They switched like you switch in Mario Kart Double Dash. Silver, home to the Pokémon master. He is a good cook. Outside, Amy and Pinkie came up to the window without the others noticing.</p>

<p>They hold arms and ready themselves. Cameras and video crew have came to record this amazing event. Dash opened and straightens her wings. Mickey asked. Instead, they were all black and crispy. They ran around, telling stories of their past adventures.</p>

<p>Now for that announcement I was talking about. Amy said. The new formed friends looked at her with fear. After what seemed to be like hours, they were both wore out and was laying on the grass next to each other, starring at the stars.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ever wanna let you downI don&#39;t ever wanna leave this town&#39;Cause after allThis city never sleeps tonight</p>

<p>I am requesting that you gather your friends and come to Canterlot immediately, I do not know if the situation is an emergency, but you must come here right now, there are these two creatures that seem to be hedgehogs, they just came out of nowhere and crashed into the throne room, I wonder if Fluttershy will be able to calm them down if they get out of control. Rainbow yelled. Dash grabbed her friend and flew on over to Sonic and the others. Sonic joyfully said. Mickey Mouse got to do it.</p>

<p>Sonic walking into first period (rainbow is not in this class) and was greeted by Tails</p>

<p>Tails&#39; face fell. Ash asked. Wave shouted. Applejack more because at the moment it seemed as if Twilight and Tails were having their own geek fest. They pulled apart and blushed</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an abrupt oven door to the head. TELL ME! When suddenly…Bam. Instead, they were all black and crispy. When they all landed, they fell in a puff of smoke. Thinking about that was a mistake; she suddenly remembered her dreams without trying.</p>

<p>Sonic and friends entered the shop and ordered their favorite drinks. XD</p>

<p>&quot;Well…I guess I can introduce myself at least.</p>

<p>&quot;Howdy there partner, my name&#39;s Applejack&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic&#39;s mind swelled with rage. Wait, she won&#39;t make it in time. Fluttershy screamed and fell over in fright at the terrible, monstrous, EVIL…shadow of a tree. Sonic looked behind him and there was that monster sized contraption of military insanity he already saw twice now. Rainbow stood behind him, confused and a little hurt by Sonic just running off like that.</p>

<p>Sonic had been running for about an hour. And the Elements were sucked in. Do you like rainbow dash?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, that&#39;s MY quote!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Calvin!</p>

<p>BAD SANIK! Take it easy!</p>

<p>&quot; Oh lighten up Max we got this&quot; Aura said feeling confident and then looks at Sonic &quot; Hey bud do you want to sit this one out or do you want to scramble some eggs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; I don&#39;t think now&#39;s the time to start chatting Aura&quot; the fox responded while giving him a serious look</p>

<p>&quot;WOOHOOOOOO!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah he did Nero,&quot; Pinkie said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the same world with the Stonecutter&#39;s Quill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about you?</p>

<p>The music ends and everyone applauded the girls for their performance. And her voice was coder then a winter&#39;s night. So, we&#39;re not sleeping the grass right? Before we head by to our own places, how about we stop at the Drink Stop? They belong to their owners.</p>

<p>Sonic, Tails and Pinkie walked over to the Carousel Boutique and Sonic opened the door. GO! He told Dash&#39;s parents that his parents died the night before. my... It wasn&#39;t tiny; it was around the same size as Rainbow. Sonic is..</p>

<p>The traffic light turned green and all the drivers (plus Applebloom she&#39;s in charge of the gas pedal) slammed down their gas pedals. The staf glowed dark green. Over next to a blue house, a rabbit decided to get some breakfast. Knuckles grunted as he knocked 10 to 15 apples into a basket he had strapped onto his back. Scootaloo hopped on and reached the end without even a scratch.</p>

<p>Applejack watched from the side-lines as Tails and Twilight geeked over each others technological knowledge. It keeps me busy. All the sudden, a portal opened. When I saw it, I spat out my tea. Sonic had always been like this. he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tails and Twilight were strolling around outside. He looked up to see the blue hedgehog and a winged pony. Shall we begin?</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be too worried Tails.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sound familiar in any way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure!&quot;</p>

<p>You were 20% faster then me!&quot;</p>

<p>Everything&#39;s fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about you?</p>

<p>Both girls pushed their opponent&#39;s hand with all of their strength. The little fuzzy animals started to wake up and stretch out their limbs. He was watching everyone eating to their heart&#39;s content and Sonic just stood there, bored.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t talked in a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>But help me fill in the blank parts, ok?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or should I say &#39;Sonic Impact&#39; now?&quot;</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. AMY!</p>

<p>&quot;Chocolate…&quot; was all he had to say.</p>

<p>Tails bounced around a bit. Secretly though. He charged towards Team Rocket. The minute Sonic saved her was the minute Necromius set his sights on killing Sonic. SONIC!</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic!</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry Derpy, for I have failed you.</p>

<p>&quot;Just give it and your little mouse to us,&quot; Jessie said.</p>

<p>The party cannon shot a big strawberry cake at Rainbow. Inside of it was a man. Probably will submit the next one today. Silver had a bandage on the spot where Trixie threw the GameBoy at. Are you up for sword practice late?</p>

<p>Before the seven of them knew what on earth the thing was, it stared to suck all of them in. Fluttershy covered her face. TURN IT OFF! There was nothing leading anyone to believe that it was started by a campfire, and at the time there weren&#39;t any clouds over Sweet Apple Acres, so it couldn&#39;t have been a Pegasus mistakenly causing a lightning strike.</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. Since they are evil, they try to get rid of Keepers, other Disney characters that are not villains, and me. Sonic stopped dead in his tracks. Rainbow stood behind him, confused and a little hurt by Sonic just running off like that.</p>

<p>The lights went over to the judge&#39;s table and Luna waved hi and Candence gave two peace sighs. Spike and Twilight chuckled at the fox&#39;s innocent ways. They don&#39;t like each other like that.</p>

<p>Rainbow walks up the counter and asks for some ketchup packs, but the cashier was a dick and decided to pick the EXTREME hot sauce packs and just for a FYI, hot sauce upsets rainbow&#39;s stomach A LOT. MORE. We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. said Twilight, for indeed, the four ponies had trotted through the door. She flew to the Acres and looked for Sonic.</p>

<p>See you next time, and have good night everybody.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Alright…</h2>

<p>Cream walked out of the kitchen after helping out Rouge and ran into Tails</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know where they were!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you listen to her!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What else would your girlfriend be?&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s goi-&quot; Spike started but was cut off.</p>

<p>&quot;WAIT!</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does happen,&quot; Twilight explained to Brock.</p>

<p>&quot;B-but…&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hugh, my head…&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think that was?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You couldn&#39;t wait two seconds, could you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no…&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>Tails had been frightened to death by the sudden appearance of the two ponies and had tugged on one of his appendages. Calvin said. I galloped out of my room, out side, and to Everfree Forest. The head of a blue stallion rose out of the ruble. I got busy at home with back-to-school shopping, clothes, etc.</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic and Amy the Hedgehog and Tails at your service!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;ll take a while for you to get used to that body.&quot;</p>

<p>Silver walked into the Nurse&#39;s office and sat by Fluttershy&#39;s bed. Pinkie? Keio ran to the door. He&#39;s a nice boy. We are supposed to have an open-mike night. Maybe she was right to try to convince Sonic not to do it.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. said Amy in a triumphant sort of way.</p>

<p>It was little above their budget but rainbow threw in some cash and they mange. Sonic bend down in a running position. Mickey asked. Maybe he can work at the nearby bakery&#39; Sonic though. Mario nodded. Even brilliant inventors such as Tails had their bad moments and one of them was inside Tails&#39; basement at the moment.</p>

<p>BAM Went a sound. The members of the club went to the observation window but they can&#39;t hear what Silver and Sonic are saying.</p>

<p>Cream waited patiently and her mind was about to wander off into dreaming when a rope ladder was dropped down and Wave slid smoothly down the ladder. Wait, how did you get here Mokuba?</p>

<p>Racing day is tomorrow and Amanda wants to be in it, but have no partner. The Pegasus turned his attention to Sonic. HA! Why are you looking down?</p>

<p>Silver closes the door and Sonic ran to Tails&#39; place. Sweetie Belle asked. Everyone got silent. The truck was still on their tail, and Canterlot High was not too far away. She was trying to process what she saw the night before. She pushed everyone and everything out of her way</p>

<p>Twilight blushed at this statement. He looked around to see Bowser smiling, Yoshi and Luigi faces looked like they saw a Boo, and saw the Seven Stars glowing rapidly. Is rainbow dash here?</p>

<p>And not much else, Sonic and Rainbow arrived with a disgruntled Vector and a sullen Espio.</p>

<p>Thank stars you&#39;re here, There&#39;s this…thing in the barn and IT TALKS and and I have no idea what to do and…&quot; &quot;Hold up big brother,&quot; Applejack said.</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. Thank God it didn&#39;t go very far before it hit water. Elise said this could boost up my confidence</p>

<p>Twilight was on the couch next to Rainbow, passed out. Let&#39;s see if you can counter this! He yelled. Tails and Cream clapped.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. He knew that Sonic had threatened him with Tails&#39; chocolate escapades…once again. All he did was laugh. Keio picked up. they will be gone for the next 3 weeks</p>

<p>Then the mice from Mario&#39;s room stormed in Sonic&#39;s room. Suddenly he fell over. Sonic was knocked out and Pinkie ignored Rainbow&#39;s pleas. I&#39;ll pay</p>

<p>The girl that found him, Dash, looked at him with intrigue from the corner of her eyes. And by that I mean he charged at Metal, who just raised his hoof and punched him into the mirror behind him. Before anyone asks, here is what I mean by Disney Villains. Cream asked as she holds Fluttershy. What are you gonna do with those?</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. He immediately noticed it, as it looked oddly like a Chaos Emerald…wait…it WAS a Chaos Emerald! Why are you covered in grease?</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. They made idle chat for a while. he asked. They were relaxing in a small lounge built specially for, well, lounging. Maybe this will teach you to skip P.E.</p>

<p>Rouge jumped from her spot and kicked the bomb back at Amy and Pinkie. We don&#39;t even have a robot to work on! Dash&#39;s dad asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Nuh-uh!</p>

<p>Sonic noticed the two of them and silently awwwed in his mind. Tails chuckled.</p>

<p>Rainbow was there when Sonic last met Necromius. Twilight&#39;s horn glowed, getting for some kind of fighting spell. The music suddenly stops. She had very lightly colorful mane and an image of the sun was on her flank.</p>

<p>R.I.P. At least their classes are like 30 minutes each. The man had the same shirt, gloves, and boots like the woman, but had white pants. DX</p>

<p>Sonic didn&#39;t really have a good place to stay, and now that he was a pony the tree was out of the question. Pikachu fell in as well. (no offense, loremaster XD) ~mb6</p>

<p>&quot;Eggman is indeed, an egg shaped man.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be fine Rainbow,&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>&quot;Meh, it&#39;s nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;To denounced evil of truth and love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The end is near,&quot; Maleficent spoke.</p>

<p>The cry pierced the air as a certain pink hedgehog smashed through the already-open door and hugged Sonic, who fell over in embarrassment. Everyone did as she said this time. Mario and Luigi were on the left side. Sonic said it would work for him and took the job. Because of that, the portals closed.</p>

<p>At this time, Tails had just finished his hedgehog tracker and Twilight was very impressed with his efforts. There was no sunlight streaming through, the darkness only looming around. Spike ran and kissed Rarity&#39;s hoof. I&#39;ll pay</p>

<p>Tails and knuckles passed the line into their 4th lap. Sonic already placed are order for Papa Johns.</p>

<p>The bell ringed and everyone put their robots in the storage room. She had slightest, tiniest feeling that something was going to fall. Where am I? It came from a six year old kid with black pants, red and black striped shirt, and yellow spike hair. After knowing Scootaloo for around a year now, one thing did come to mind.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Roxas!</p>

<p>&quot;Uh…16?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah… it really is you.&quot;</p>

<p>Max engulfed Aura in a telekinetic grip that safely put him out of harms way, Sonic saw this as an opportunity to take down Eggman while he&#39;s distracted, without getting noticed he quickly used his Sonic Boost to knock the robot down to the ground. Tails said.</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. Last night had been a party to celebrate Ponyville&#39;s freedom-Just because they felt like it. It electacuted Sonic &amp; Rainbow Dash. Not in the same way that Flash Sentry used to be interested in Sunset Shimmer, but the way she first found a ball when she was old enough to kick it. Mario asked. But just to be safe, I am going to hire a spy.</p>

<p>Twilight sat in her library, watching the events on camera, and wondering how many views this could rack up on PonyTube. GOOD NIGHT, T.J COMMIUNTY SCHOOL!</p>

<p>Rarity was trying her hardest to look fashionable but anything was 20% harder with Pinkie Pie around. Peach questions. As Sonic opened his eyes agonizingly, he realized that he was sitting on top of a tree. They ran around, telling stories of their past adventures.</p>

<p>Later on that day, everyone was working in the gym for the open mic night. At least their classes are like 30 minutes each. The emerald flew to the center of a circle of the other Chaos Emeralds. Applejack rolled her eyes. TELL ME! Sonic ran into Rainbow, who was running late due to her not getting enough sleep.</p>

<p>Rainbow is lead sonic to the front of the complex to show him their project, a miniature replica of Mobius, but it wasn&#39;t done yet. He has short light blue hair, forest green eyes, and a short nose. In order to get my friendship back, you need to be my slave for tonight</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. We apologise for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>Both of them went to their own rooms. All you can eat buffet, here we come!</p>

<p>She turns on the aiming screen and grabbed the control stick. She&#39;s pissed at you.</p>

<p>Twilight stared at Cream in disgust. Really the only one who didn&#39;t believe it was Dash, but then again she knew a lot of his origin. She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. I&#39;m not tired! Twilight asked as she helped him up. Anyway just watch it to see what happened</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. How did you make it? Mario eye&#39;s shrunk. Suddenly, his cellphone started to ring.</p>

<p>TL flipped the note over and continued reading</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Sonic, Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot;</p>

<p>Shadow was looking at an empty plate. Twilight said. She was beautiful, but her beauty was ruined by her green skin. And give you a big hug for figuring out I did that XD</p>

<p>Scootaloo was speechless, her eyes wide and her jaw dropped. When you do something I record it.</p>

<p>Both tails and knuckles jumped at Rouge&#39;s sudden appearance.</p>

<p>She paid for it and the shopkeeper took it back to get it ready for Twilight&#39;s big night. She set up a meeting place for a date they organized earlier, and she was sure Sonic got the message that they&#39;d be meeting in the Statue Garden. Hey guys! Luigi asked. Sonic asked with a smirk. You know about your condition.</p>

<p>Uh…ok! Roxas and Sora roared in fear. READ IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

<p>Cream mumbled in reply and practically dragged Wave downstairs so that she could get to work on identifying what had gone wrong and if Sonic and Co. Twilight gasped as he said this. She saw Zatch munching on a Yellow Tail Fish. It was like a small spiky ball…thingy…wait was it talking?</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. I might throw in some more sonicXRD in this</p>

<p>&quot;Well then we&#39;ll just have a race to see who&#39;s faster&quot;</p>

<p>And you can boss Storm around,</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow looked up at the leader board, seeing Tails and Knuckles&#39; pictures being taken down</p>

<p>Twilight and the others decided to go back to her library, as that would probably be the first place Sonic and Rainbow would go if they had found anyone. The six ponies split up in groups of two; Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy went into the Forest, Twilight and Applejack to Sweet Apple Acres and Pinkie and Rarity searched along the outskirts of town. Suddenly he, Yoshi, Luigi, the Seven Stars, and the gem were suddenly sucked away into who knows where. That&#39;s not the point!</p>

<p>Then another guy came floating down. Rarity? Scootaloo let Sonic go. She opened her purple reddish eyes to see where she is. He stopped running along and answered his call from, you guessed it, Tails.</p>

<p>Dash was horrified at what she was reading. She gave Espio a kick and when he didn&#39;t respond, she ran off into a small town…</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll stick around for more of the story! The head of a blue stallion rose out of the ruble. He ran towards it. You are about to find out. Hopes she get better.</p>

<p>Unknown and Amanda caught up to them. Rouge pulled out a cooler and handed out a root beer to her, Sonic, Sonia, and Manic. And Calvin was chewing on chocolate chip cookies. Sonic grinned. When suddenly…Bam. She placed a bouquet of flowers on the tombstone and sat down with her hands folded and her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Tails and cream made their way to the dance floor in the gym and saw flutter singing to her heart&#39;s content. Tails said. he yelled with joy. When he almost passed out, I let him go. When Cadence and Shining Armor, Twilight&#39;s big brother, got married, Shining gave Cadence a locket. Tails and Cream clapped.</p>

<p>Everyone agreed and left. 2 preteens and adult that looks his eyes are just his eyebrows. Let&#39;s win this</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. It took him five minutes before he could say it.</p>

<p>10 minutes/5 rounds later, Calvin and Susie won volleyball. Twilight whispered, trying to hold in her laughing.</p>

<p>Then the mice from Mario&#39;s room stormed in Sonic&#39;s room. AJXKNUX. Everywhere Dash looked, structures that were probably stable at one point were collapsing on their own weight. No!</p>

<p>A few hours ago, Trixie ordered room service. Then her cutie mark appeared. Now my time! Remember last time you got on stage alone?</p>

<p>&quot;My tail is twitching!&quot;</p>

<p>Mickey answered, &quot;They are 5, but now 7, teenagers that protect the Walt Disney World parks at night from the Overtakers at night after the lights go out.&quot;</p>

<p>well lets see&quot; Twilight said taking the letter with her magic</p>

<p>&quot;HEY!</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie were getting ready for the tie-breaker. Sonic&#39;s new body must&#39;ve been finished. PEOPLE ARE PASSING US!</p>

<p>&quot;That is what it is?&quot;</p>

<p>_.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, so you two have finally awoken from your unconscious state&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So am I,&quot; said Celestia.</p>

<p>And that definitely does not count as &quot;normal&quot;.</p>

<p>The 6 ponies left Spike behind to look up in the library what could have been a possible cause of a random explosion in the sky, while they ran off to try find the cause of the explosion by asking other ponies. She yelped. SHADOW! GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTORS!</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow put their stuff in the room pinkie gave them. I want you guys to draw us a picture of your favorite scene of this story. Like I told the other students, find another to stay at for the next two days while we take care of the problem. Twilight calmed down a little. TEST! I didn&#39;t go overboard like these guys</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. You…</h2>

<p>LATE CHAPTER ALERT</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. Chow on this.</p>

<p>It was late, so I didn&#39;t bother waking you up.&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic took that rather nicely. Last night had been a party to celebrate Ponyville&#39;s freedom-Just because they felt like it. Tails said, smiling.</p>

<p>Scootaloo was speechless, her eyes wide and her jaw dropped. Mr. She was startled to see Jet appear on the screen with…a guitar? Look him up on YouTube</p>

<p>Intrigued, she stepped back a little to see the screen a little better. Megaman does sound good, but I might save him for later. Let&#39;s see if you can counter this! Tails did a slight wave. she said mischievously.</p>

<p>&quot;I do as a matter of fact,&quot; Rouge says.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be playing with flames.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah… but how?&quot;</p>

<p>All we know is that they were trying to travel to a different world but it looks like they blew up while trying.&quot;</p>

<p>Hobbes rolled his eyes, &quot;Looks who&#39;s talking.</p>

<p>&quot;Here goes&quot; Tails said revealing the teleporter &quot;Whoah&quot; &quot;This is my dimensional teleporter&quot; Tails explained</p>

<p>Sonic took a quick look behind him and gasped to see the pony…flying? He immediately noticed it, as it looked oddly like a Chaos Emerald…wait…it WAS a Chaos Emerald! The cat looked somewhat normal, but had some kind of golden thing on his head. One by one, the ponies fell in. There was something in his eyes that looked odd, like he was willing her to wake up. Normally, people would have given her a weird eye like they did to Sonic or Knuckles, but because of Amy&#39;s pure rage at something nobody (not even I, the author) knew, they stayed at least 10 feet away from her.</p>

<p>Rainbow and Fluttershy walked meekly (well Fluttershy did anyways) into the forest. Cream and Calvin said. We can&#39;t stop him. The pink pony was bouncing around, laughing, giggling and who know what while Rarity looked as if she would give her entire life savings to not be right next to Pinkie who was now trying to make jokes to lighten the mood. PEOPLE ARE PASSING US!</p>

<p>Two down, one to go, Sonic thought to himself. Suddenly he started to sing, and Cream watched, wondering what on earth was going on…</p>

<p>Sonic was going to Canterlot High for about a week when the spirit of the Fall Formal came around. It looked like it was made of silver. And by probably, Tails meant there was only a 67% chance they were actually going to make it.</p>

<p>They both headed downstairs to check on Tails&#39; experiments. Vector said cheerfully, and jumped straight through Tails&#39; window.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. Later, Sonic and Dash were talking at Fluttershy&#39;s which still had the big hole in it after Sonic&#39;s run-in with it. Out of nowhere a portal opened. I love living here.</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. When he was spotless and completely dry, he went down to his laboratory.</p>

<p>Everyone was looking at Sonic in shock. Too fast…always avoiding her…she began to think if it was even worth chasing after Sonic anymore. But before he can run, a pink hedgehog with a red dress and pretty emerald eyes dog piled Sonic. Suddenly he started to sing, and Cream watched, wondering what on earth was going on…</p>

<p>Sonic started humming a song that he really liked, he heard it on one of his adventures. Besides, we have to wait for the rest of them to get here. Vector shouted at Sonic.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on Fluttershy, I&#39;ll catch him!&quot;</p>

<p>Mario asked, &quot;Why is it purple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came up with one an hour ago,&quot; Cadence said.</p>

<p>I am requesting that you gather your friends and come to Canterlot immediately, I do not know if the situation is an emergency, but you must come here right now, there are these two creatures that seem to be hedgehogs, they just came out of nowhere and crashed into the throne room, I wonder if Fluttershy will be able to calm them down if they get out of control. Discord&#39;s eyes strangely flashed green.</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. community college. Silver shouted.</p>

<p>Rarity was left there with a big smile on her face. A human with rainbow streaked hair, crimson eyes and skin of light teal. We can&#39;t stop him. EAH! You&#39;re blinding yourself!</p>

<p>Knuckles grabbed Applejack and put her in his arms while he glided down to safety. Sora nodded and walked away. Let&#39;s get practicing! Keio picked up. he asked. Please explain that.</p>

<p>Everyone, even the other racers, laughed at Celestia&#39;s joke. Celestia, Luna and Candence were the judges. When Dash went to sleep in her own room, by herself, she started dreaming.</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. GO! Er, Sorry Rainbow…</p>

<p>Just as he was drenching them in maple syrup, Knuckles and Amy wandered through the door. Mickey looked all around him; he saw he was in his room in his bed. The team of Amy Rose and Pinkie Pie had a burnout!</p>

<p>Twilight ran to the bathroom to splash some water on her face. Ash and Dawn laughed knowing that he meant by Croagunk. they said.</p>

<p>Dash&#39;s Parents loaned Sonic the guest room for a while. Fluttershy then took Twilight out of the shop and she bump into Blade.</p>

<p>Sonic was walking to 2nd period, with a massive headache and a member ID card in his hand. YOU&#39;RE FIRED! But her shock looked different, like he figured out something that would&#39;ve been impossible to know, just by looking at someone. He called. After the &#39;Pinkie Cannon thing&#39;, everyone started to party. WE COULD HAVE WON!</p>

<p>There were a knocking on the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Sonic, how much further is your friend&#39;s workshop?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fl...</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. It was unbelievable. There explain why she feel bad for me when she hurts me, sits close to me when we have our briefings and when we have nap time, she would cuddle next to me and stokes my arm?</p>

<p>Sonic called Dominos but couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Rainbow. Before Discord could get away, Nichimon used her part of the Elements of Harmony; The Element of Darkness. Applejack and Applebloom asked. Everyone in the audience was cheering to their hearts content. Hey, want to check the Pokémon club before we hit the Psychic Club?</p>

<p>&quot;PIKACHU!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok let me try to sense if we&#39;re alone in this place&quot; he said trying to sense any other auras in the area.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow snickered a bit.</p>

<p>Tails&#39; face fell. Either of us are taking it lightly. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. Twilight whispered, trying to hold in her laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, now that you mention it Twilight, I do feel kinda weird.</p>

<p>&quot;Who, or what are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NOOOOO LOOOKING!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Later guys, I want to chat with Sonic,&quot; Mario says to his brother.</p>

<p>Can you get it?&quot;</p>

<p>A cool rock, a native artifact, or even a gem,&quot; Calvin told her.</p>

<p>&quot;Tails, have you eaten any chocolate recently?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can call me, Tailspin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why don&#39;t you give up?</p>

<p>Tails and knuckles passed the line into their 4th lap. Bear in mind that I am not a brony and six is not a pegasister so rainbow and her friends might be OOC. BTW, aren&#39;t you in the hospital after Demon threw you out the window?</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an abrupt oven door to the head. shouted a voice. It means a lot to me. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. Why? Sorry</p>

<p>Applejack watched from the side-lines as Tails and Twilight geeked over each others technological knowledge. I&#39;m hungry!</p>

<p>Rainbow Dash trotted over to Twilight&#39;s house. I don&#39;t cuss</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic and Knuckles were chatting a little about the ponies in Ponyville. It was Metal and Chrysalis, talking about the thing beyond the mirror coming sooner than they hoped. You want to be a cheerleader?</p>

<p>Rainbow woke up in a cold sweat. Mickey&#39;s eyes winded. As for the other figure, it was a Dark Red hedgehog with all quills pointing up, dark blue eyes, wearing a black shirt with a white sleeveless hoodie on top, black pants, black converse (having the same function as Sonic&#39;s shoes), and white fingerless gloves.</p>

<p>As they were admiring Tails&#39; invention Eggman had heard enough and decided to sabotage the teleporter knowing that it will malfunction with the Chaos Emeralds power and teleport them away to who knows where. slave</p>

<p>Oh Christ I&#39;m getting later by the day. The racers was putting the final touches to their prized karts.</p>

<p>Sonic rushed to Mario&#39;s door and tried to break it down, but ended up hurting himself</p>

<p>&quot;Are you twerps done yet?</p>

<p>&quot;GET AWAY!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was wondering…uh...do you feel like something&#39;s up today?</p>

<p>&quot;Look Rainbow, I just really don&#39;t like the forest it kinda…creeps me out a li-WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT!?&quot;</p>

<p>sonic was standing by the food stand, eating a chili dog. The green gemstone came flying right out of his hand. I guess it&#39;s been a long time anyways. Applejack said. MORE. I need to return something to Rarity!</p>

<p>Behind a line drawn by Pikachu, Sonic and Dash were getting ready. Mario said. he shouted. BTW, on 2 things. But who knows, I can be wrong.</p>

<p>Knuckles pulled out the phone that Rouge gave him and played the noises Rouge, which was with Amy and Pinkie was in the closet. We can&#39;t stop him. It didn&#39;t take long for her to charged at Sonic. One by one, the ponies fell in. Flutter was shaking, but rainbow successfully got the object out.</p>

<p>&quot;And I&#39;m Spike&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you?&quot;</p>

<p>Amy sighed. Besides, we have to wait for the rest of them to get here. BTW, aren&#39;t you in the hospital after Demon threw you out the window?</p>

<p>Pinkie went up to Amy and grabbed her glove, seeing a tiny needle on the index finger part of the glove.</p>

<p>&quot;The name sounds bone chilling,&quot; &quot;They are Disney villains who try to take over the parks.</p>

<p>&quot;One of your most beloved worlds will get it.</p>

<p>&quot;He must&#39;ve wanted this a lot.</p>

<p>and &quot;Darling stay away from it!&quot;.</p>

<p>Mario asked, &quot;Why is it purple?&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow snickered a bit.</p>

<p>Strangely, she felt a little jealous too. She pulled out a cyan blue jewel. Then, before I cold register it, the weirdest thing happened. In order to get my friendship back, you need to be my slave for tonight</p>

<p>All three drivers floored their karts to the fastest they can go. Sonic almost ran into several trees as his brain worked to try and figure out what these pony things were. Twilight asked. Calvin says. You need and two-person kart to race</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous summer day. she said awkwardly. He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. Twilight said. It&#39;s a lot different from what I&#39;m used to.</p>

<p>Rainbow got into Sonic&#39;s bed and pulled the cover up to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Scootaloo wants to know if you could think of anything that would help us,&quot; Applebloom explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, you were DEFINITELY faster!&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. We are no different. Ash then asked. Really?</p>

<p>Dash was horrified at what she was reading. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. They turned their heads to see 20 meters ahead that some sand fell. Twilight asked. You took off like you just seen a ghost! Tails replied.</p>

<p>They started pushing and everyone was cheering them on. my... Sonic was destroyed.</p>

<p>Rainbow looked at Knuckles with fear. Discord stuttered. The princess asked in a shocked manner</p>

<p>Rainbow Dash trotted over to Twilight&#39;s house. Mario turned around. Dawn asked. Going to the dentist tomorrow.</p>

<p>He looked at the voice and saw a white unicorn with wings… no alicorn. Sonic heard from Silver that he and Trixie came back to town. I looked at the black creature, who was looking at Nichimon. What was that about? Shadow just shrugged and flipped some burgers. Rainbow took off to the sky with a whoosh of her wings.</p>

<p>-Meanwhile, NOT in Twilight Sparkle&#39;s thoughts…-</p>

<p>Sonic had been running for about an hour. So Sonic did the most natural thing he could think of. Cream looked closer to that his two big bushy tails were twisted into a knot. I&#39;M PAYING FOR THAT!</p>

<p>-with Amy and Pinkie-</p>

<p>Tails and cream made their way to the dance floor in the gym and saw flutter singing to her heart&#39;s content. Kiddo asked. Out of nowhere a portal opened. they yelled. Scootaloo let Sonic go. Now, pay up!</p>

<p>At this moment in time, Pinkie and Rarity had just had an unfortunate encounter with a pony who had started rambling on about economics and poverty and whatnot. While you were stretching your legs, you purposely put your legs in front of me!</p>

<p>Strangely, she felt a little jealous too. Cream argued. He slowly got up and wobbled a little. Sonic mornings just as much as Tails did. When her and Sonic got to the rooms, however, things go bad.</p>

<p>The day of the annual double dash has come. As soon as Pinkie moved on to Sonic with her REALLY big knife, Rainbow stated to panic and beg Pinkie not to do it. Hello Twilight! Can you PM me your story?</p>

<p>Celestia held out her hoof taking the emerald. I won&#39;t make you into a cupcake!</p>

<p>Flutter walk to Pinkie&#39;s house and knocked on the door. She was startled to see Jet appear on the screen with…a guitar? Her pillow was wet; maybe because of the dream she just had which left her crying. Scootaloo let Sonic go. He looked around to see Bowser smiling, Yoshi and Luigi faces looked like they saw a Boo, and saw the Seven Stars glowing rapidly. I got it!</p>

<p>Since today was Saturday, the teens of T.J. And she smiled at him.</p>

<p>Max still had Aura in his telekinetic grip as Aura curled himself into a ball and started to spin with his Aura Blade ready. he yelled. Twilight&#39;s horn glowed, getting for some kind of fighting spell. Want to stop by Subway?</p>

<p>Everyone, even the other racers, laughed at Celestia&#39;s joke. Mickey asked. She had slightest, tiniest feeling that something was going to fall. Fluttershy, just remember what I have taught you and you&#39;ll be fine</p>

<p>The 6 ponies left Spike behind to look up in the library what could have been a possible cause of a random explosion in the sky, while they ran off to try find the cause of the explosion by asking other ponies. Rouge says. All the racers groaned</p>

<p>Cause a lot of people do it.)  </p>

<h2>Chapter 16. If anything I&#39;m trying to save this place</h2>

<p>&#39;Ello again, and welcome back to The Pony Parable!</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles fought over the driving wheel and result in them crashing into the wall, destroying their kart. You know what; scratch that, everything seemed perfect.</p>

<p>On my terms this is long (not rly lololo) but meh, It&#39;s done and I&#39;m happy! Just when the CMC didn&#39;t think it could get any cooler, Scootaloo drove the Scooter up the side of a tree at an angle that wrapped around the tree once before she reached the top. But she was completely thrown off by his answer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Vector did not know that Tails had installed mini-turrets to go off if a biological being went through the window. Discord&#39;s eyes flashed green. As soon as I heard emo, Silver was on the ground choking. Applejack knew she had heard the sound around the same time as Knuckles and the others had appeared, and said it to Knuckles.</p>

<p>Amy walks towards Rainbow&#39;s side and Rainbow face away from her</p>

<p>Speaking of the cobalt hedgehog, at this very moment he was out for his morning jog, running along a grassy land which was full of cows, pigs and other assorted animals as the morning sun, full of bright energy, crept up on the still-sleeping farm. he got a small shack for a house and there is no room</p>

<p>Tails and knuckles passed the line into their 4th lap. GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTORS!</p>

<p>Tails devoured the rest of his meal and went down to his lab, saying to Knuckles as he walked down the stairs that he had some finishing touches before the machine would be ready to teleport them to Chris&#39; world.</p>

<p>Vinyl throws it on and the music starts. The cat looked somewhat normal, but had some kind of golden thing on his head. Thanks, Rarity!</p>

<p>&quot;Well sure we can talk, you seem to be able to, not trying to be rude though&quot; Aura replied</p>

<p>The library might have some answers to his teleportation dilemma.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brock!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;TAILS STOP IT MY HEAD&#39;S GOING TO EXPLODE!&quot;</p>

<p>Mama me a, it&#39;s bright,&quot; Falgore said.</p>

<p>I have nothing to say except well, thanks for reading! Everyone was a little freaked out by all this, but after 5 minutes it wasn&#39;t so bad. Do you have any golden mushrooms?</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. They walked across a log in the middle of a stream. Twilight and Fluttershy came in 5th.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. HA! I was so caught up with the cheering and applauding, that no one realised I had used chaos control, until it was too late. He was the only one who&#39;s Avatar made sense knowing his ability. I might be able to do something with it&#39;s power to try and find the others. I want to show you something in my room.</p>

<p>Sonic moved. Espio just face-palmed and walked with Sonic and Rainbow back to Ponyville to find the others.</p>

<p>Both of them sigh in relief.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. then that same force just tore the Saws right off the body crushed them and tossed them higher up and away than possible for a normal creature.</p>

<p>Cream stared at him. Have a good night everybody.</p>

<p>I am Cadence, Princess of the Crystal Empire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I LOVE JENNY AND JOOOOOYYYYYYY!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should turn the sand into ice.</p>

<p>Continuing on! said Twilight. Our heroes jumped. An actual baby dragon! Fluttershy exclaimed. Can you PM me your story?</p>

<p>Tails and cream made their way to the dance floor in the gym and saw flutter singing to her heart&#39;s content. Mickey asked. This blade was passed down from generation to generation by my family.</p>

<p>Have your breakfast and call me when the rest get here ok?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok here goes, Aura Spin Slice!&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to tell you and didn&#39;t listen,&quot; Sonic told him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. Today, sonic was snoozing comfortably on the couch in the apartment when rainbow came in with a big box in her hands. Sonic knocked on his door and Tails opened it.</p>

<p>Twilight was startled at Tails&#39; sudden outburst at the rabbit. Sora asked slamming the door open. Shadow said. And her skin was… well you get the picture.</p>

<p>After this…serious character development, Tails, Twilight and a thoroughly frightened Cream pushed their way through a swarm of ponies and reached Fluttershys cottage. No, he was NOT trying to pretend he was in Minecraft, he was helping out Applejack with her apples as it was apple bucking season and seeing as, well, echidnas aren&#39;t the best buckers in the world, Knuckles was doing what he loved best and was punching trees for his life.</p>

<p>Knuckles sighed as he pulled a sparkling jewel from his pocket. He was groaning…his head hurt and he felt sick. Eggman hovering and spying on his enemies. Tia and Zatch asked. Susie managed to block it back.</p>

<p>Sonic moved. Sonic stopped dead in his tracks. Falgore screamed. NO! As they stopped cheering Sonic walked up to them with a smile and gave them a thumbs up, the two also gave the hedgehog thumbs up.</p>

<p>Rarity was left there with a big smile on her face. Discord&#39;s eyes strangely flashed green.</p>

<p>Rainbow went to the food stand to grab some snacks. Where are you going?</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Mickey responded.</p>

<p>Tails jumped at Twilight&#39;s sudden appearance</p>

<p>Applejack watched from the side-lines as Tails and Twilight geeked over each others technological knowledge. It was also catching up to him at an amazing speed, so Sonic turned around and decided to boost his speed up. Pinkie Pie was slurping on Diet soda. She easily opens it and climbs in there. I see you brought the entire crew long! I&#39;M PAYING FOR THAT!</p>

<p>&quot;Now why on EARTH do you need ME?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow…that&#39;s really impressive.</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s just get to the point,&quot; Mewoth said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok not bad, but who are you guys exactly?&quot;</p>

<p>Jet shifted uncomfortably in his seat. James said. Once there he started bending some things here, and twisting other things there. She will type again</p>

<p>Cream had to fight to not collapse with laughter. She was annoyed at the fact that she hadn&#39;t a clue where she was and even more annoyed that even the Detective Agency didn&#39;t want to investigate. When you do something I record it.</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. It was Discord, the spirit of Chaos and Disharmony.</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t working, ok?</p>

<p>&quot;Well I&#39;d be happy to you our names since all that&#39;s going to be left of you is just a single nose hair, but we&#39;re not going to introduce ourselves to a man who can&#39;t control their own body weight&quot; Max replied with a cocky attitude</p>

<p>Dashy woke up in her room back in Cloudsdale. Come with me to the back!</p>

<p>The ignition of a very large motor engine (gotcha, didn&#39;t I?). she said. It was Livin la vida loca by Ricky Martin. They looked at the girdle to see burgers. Rainbow tried her hardest to stop laughing at the unfortunately shy pony.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. Mario yelled. Susie asked. Why are we here? Aura asked while rubbing his head in pain</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. Sonic asked Twilight. She let out a burst of speed and caught Sonic, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Let&#39;s see if you can counter this! Now, pay up!</p>

<p>Rainbow looked at Knuckles with fear. Sonic asked. Sonic looked at his new surprised friends. I can&#39;t!</p>

<p>Sonic took a quick look behind him and gasped to see the pony…flying? MORE. She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. Twilight asked as she helped him up. Trixie pulled on her grapping hook to get them to safer grounds. Dash stopped in her tracks, with some degree of shock on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you twerps done yet?</p>

<p>&quot;How did you get in here?&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know where they were!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>But no one heard her, for Shadow said, &quot;Get set… and…&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who, may I ask, is this message from?&quot;</p>

<p>Silver led Sonic in the Testing room, where a machine of some sort was stored. Rainbow took off to the sky with a whoosh of her wings.</p>

<p>Twilight sat in her library, watching the events on camera, and wondering how many views this could rack up on PonyTube. And after that the Fire Department Ponies were able to put it out quickly. Applejack said she&#39;d agree to it if Sonic was willing. Dash stopped in her tracks, with some degree of shock on her face.</p>

<p>Seeing as it was almost night time anyways, the ponies decided to go back to their homes for the night, with Sonic and Amy following Rarity back to her house. Besides, we have to wait for the rest of them to get here. Once there he started bending some things here, and twisting other things there. Both of them covered their ears</p>

<p>Sonic dashed out the door. What happened to the Elements!? Rainbow Dash asked. They were relaxing in a small lounge built specially for, well, lounging. Jet was greeted by a boot to the head and almost fell out of the blimp. Just saying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Applejack looked at he and blushed a bit. Tails replied. I&#39;m paying!</p>

<p>I can feel the sun whenever you&#39;re near</p>

<p>Eggman&#39;s machine shot out rockets and lasers aiming at the three heroes. Few minutes later, Tails arrived in his car, looking fancy.</p>

<p>Rouge&#39;s eyes widen. It now stung pretty badly.</p>

<p>Since today was Saturday, the teens of T.J. Charmy snorted, and flew off into a grassland, ignoring the shouts and swears from Wave who was being restrained by a struggling Storm.</p>

<p>Everyone went to their homes to get some rest to start the Chaos Emerald Search tomorrow, Aura followed Applejack to her families apple farm and Sonic followed Rainbow Dash to her cloud home at an incredible speed. Since they are evil, they try to get rid of Keepers, other Disney characters that are not villains, and me. She was talking with Ash. Both of them covered their ears</p>

<p>Everyone got into a circle and Pinkie brought a empty coke bottle. Twilight said. Both dragon and pony hadn&#39;t a clue what was going on and pondered over this strange feeling, but were startled when a knock on the door took them out of their &#39;thinking coma&#39;. Sonic yelled. I want to show you something outside.</p>

<p>Twilight and the others decided to go back to her library, as that would probably be the first place Sonic and Rainbow would go if they had found anyone. ~mb7</p>

<p>After a long and stressful race, it draws to a close and everyone is at the award ceremony. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a portal opened. Amy was winning at first.</p>

<p>BAM Went a sound. He looked at me, staring at the chaos emerald in my hand. Although when they arrived at the lush green pastureland that was outside Tails&#39; house, there was an edge of uncertainty they couldn&#39;t put their finger on.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you wish your majesty&quot; The guard said bowing in respect</p>

<p>&quot;AARON, WHAT DID I JUST SAY!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;M A FREAKING PANCAKE SONIC.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more hunger then Timber Wolf that hasn&#39;t ate in 3 days.&quot;</p>

<p>DONE DONE DONE HMMMM YES. TURN IT OFF! So thank you. His expression was hard and cold as ever. He brought me this cool necklace! She smiled and wanted to go back to her room, but that nightmare of hers will keep happening.</p>

<p>Spike stared at me for a moment, before dashing out of the room. she asked.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow weakly looked at each other. Each fanfic writers always changes something here and there, it what give fics a little extra kick in quality. Let&#39;s win this thing!</p>

<p>&quot;So the red emerald went your place,&quot; Sonic says.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. But it was too late. Anyway, I want to give you something.</p>

<p>We got into MLP and we came across this one thing called a &quot;clopfic&quot;.</p>

<p>Calvin coughed, &quot;What was THAT!?&quot;</p>

<p>Shadow took off his apron that says &#39;Chaos the Cook&#39; &quot;Yeah, we need some fruit,&quot; Shadow says.</p>

<p>&quot;How did you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mom said we need to get along and have more responsibilities.</p>

<p>At this he ran up a hill and soared up into the air when he reached the top. When they were all downstairs, Tails walked over to the side of the oddly shaped machine. But just then a blue blur appeared at the moments and caught the hot dogs with 20 hot dog buns on a plate. But before he can run, a pink hedgehog with a red dress and pretty emerald eyes dog piled Sonic. The little kid shoots out a tremendous amount of lighting at Sonic and Rainbow Dash. I&#39;m just staying here for tonight then it&#39;s back out for me.</p>

<p>Twilight had arrived back to her house. Sonic said. You see, I got a solo in my chorus show</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow went home after Flutter&#39;s concert, which ended great. Mario felt like an idiot. So again please Review</p>

<p>(Mild adult joke in the fourth paragraph! Twilight asked. Applejack replied. Wait, she won&#39;t make it in time. Silver had a bandage on the spot where Trixie threw the GameBoy at. She said that it will be fun XD</p>

<p>As the curtains rised, the audience was greeted to the singer&#39;s backs. He had no idea where to go, he had no map so he couldn&#39;t get back to Sweet Apple Acres and to make it worse, he couldn&#39;t even talk to anyone without getting called a freak. She flapped her wings as fast as a hummingbird&#39;s propelling the scooter faster down the course. Scootaloo said.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Pinkie and Applejack were having lunch at Cupcake Corner. Sonic, here!</p>

<p>Rouge was secretly following Amy with her phone in her hand. Pinkie pulled something out of her settle bag. Are you up for sword practice late?</p>

<p>Rainbow is lead sonic to the front of the complex to show him their project, a miniature replica of Mobius, but it wasn&#39;t done yet. Mickey asked. Riddles, Megumi, Ponygon and Kafk. Both of them looked at each other with creeped-out faces</p>

<p>She paid for it and the shopkeeper took it back to get it ready for Twilight&#39;s big night. Anyway just watch it to see what happened</p>

<p>Whatever he saw over the balcony must&#39;ve been beautiful, because he was smiling and tearing up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. What was that!?</h2>

<p>Today is the fateful day that Twilight reveals Tails&#39; secret to the world…what will it be?</p>

<p>Sonic, rainbow and Twilight was back in their own apartment after the rats have been cleared out. Discord&#39;s eyes flashed green. They aren&#39;t lesbians.</p>

<p>Sonic noticed the two of them and silently awwwed in his mind. I DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jet was confused at the fact that there were ponies around. they yelled. An actual baby dragon! Sonic moaned and clutched his head as he had fallen head first. The light goes back to Celestia.</p>

<p>It would never have worked if I hadn&#39;t found a certain blue hair that must have brushed off on me when I fell back in the teleportation machine, thanks to Rarity&#39;s decisive eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>Are you ga-&quot;</p>

<p>-Lunchroom-</p>

<p>Charmy giggled and dodged a swipe from Jet&#39;s arm. Twilight thought. Oh wait, I can&#39;t fire you. He immediately noticed it, as it looked oddly like a Chaos Emerald…wait…it WAS a Chaos Emerald! Evil Aaron is EVIL!</p>

<p>Flutter gave Twilight a ride to the Madison Le Cruset because she didn&#39;t have a car. Brock asked. She saw Sonic on the ground in front of a mirror that looked familiar.</p>

<p>Silver and Trixie was at the foot of Mt. Susie managed to block it back.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright flash of light knocked Tails back into Sonic. Pinkie wanted to follow, but was pulled to the back of the lockers by Amy.</p>

<p>Sonic had been running for about an hour. He will perform….</p>

<p>You guys have a feeling something&#39;s going to happen as WELL as us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re still at the base getting ready,&quot; Sally answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright…&quot; Scootaloo put on her helmet hopped on her scooter, and kicked herself forward.</p>

<p>Probably faster than me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know where they were!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my gosh!</p>

<p>&quot;WOOHOOOOOO!&quot;</p>

<p>I have nothing to say except well, thanks for reading! Btw we DO NOT hate Mario. Dark green. Why did happen? By the way, make sure to come to Flutter&#39;s chorus show after school to cheer her on</p>

<p>The girl that found him, Dash, looked at him with intrigue from the corner of her eyes. They can feel each other shaking in anticipation and in nervousness. Whatever happened on the other side was something beyond Dashy&#39;s imagination.</p>

<p>Strangely, she felt a little jealous too. Then he jumped up in his seat and a light bulb flashed above his head, before remembering that gravity existed and smashed onto his head. At the mention of her name Pinkie shot up.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t a sound in Ponyville as the sunlight rose over the horizon slowly. Fluttershy covered her face. Wasn&#39;t that, Dad&#39;s voice?&#39; Maleficent walked clam and slowing across the soft sand with a warm summer breeze fluttered her robe. READ IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

<p>Charmy giggled and dodged a swipe from Jet&#39;s arm. He did the super peel-out to get out of the way, but Sonic his guard down and got hit by her horn blast. Twilight and Tails say. Tails walked over to the kitchen sink, and opened the fridge next to it. Everyone just relax except Twilight, who was pacing around sweating.</p>

<p>FINALLY YAY! And…uh…someone else? It really was a huge basement with a high ceiling.</p>

<p>Done and done! &#39;What was all that about? they yelled. A question formed on her lips and she let it out very suddenly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Rarity&#39;s Boutique, both Rarity and Amy were downstairs. Wait, how did you get here Mokuba?</p>

<p>Rainbow looked at Knuckles with fear. Sonic smiled. Sonic shouted, speeding downstairs to Tails&#39; workshop. Knuckles jumped up and gave a startled cry at the two ponies who had just appeared in front of them.</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles fought over the driving wheel and result in them crashing into the wall, destroying their kart. It showed a woman, a man, and some kind of cat. They took seats next to their friends. Mario asked. I love living here.</p>

<p>Amy woke up in the infirmary, light-headed and woozy. Except Shadow, he&#39;s a bit emo and doesn&#39;t see her with fear or alarm. And he has a mustache and a red hat with an M. When Dash went to sleep in her own room, by herself, she started dreaming.</p>

<p>They arrived at Fluttershy&#39;s house and were in no way surprised to see her feeding her animals outside her house. After 5 minutes of chatting. Eggman hovering and spying on his enemies. Sonic kept on walking until he was 1 foot from her. He and Sonic had promised that they would test a machine which would probably send them to Chris&#39; world. Aura asked out of nowhere</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. I sighed again, tapping my hoof on the table. Knuckles replied with a grin, chuckling to the foxes mouth which was covered in syrup. We are supposed to have an open-mike night. Want it back?</p>

<p>Sonic and Tails were stunned. But I just want to have a talk with you.</p>

<p>Amy returned Pinkies little jig with an even bigger frown. Before Discord could get away, Nichimon used her part of the Elements of Harmony; The Element of Darkness. They have their own karts and partner. You see, I got a solo in my chorus show</p>

<p>&quot;I want to look for something interesting?</p>

<p>It sounds pretty cool!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enjoy the party last night!?&quot;Uh…yeah, I enjoyed it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pinkie!&quot;</p>

<p>Goofy is YOUR NAME.&quot;</p>

<p>Knuckles, who had been lazing around for most of the day, was woken by a moaning Appljeack. You need and two-person kart to race</p>

<p>&quot;Nice way of greeting somebody…&quot; Cream said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;</p>

<p>They went to the subway were Tails worked at. Sweetie Belle tapped his shoulder, making him jump a bit.</p>

<p>They climb up some more. AJXKNUX. Why are we at Sonics house? Spike walked in, staring at me like I was different. XD</p>

<p>As the curtains rised, the audience was greeted to the singer&#39;s backs. It came from a rainbow haired pony. Applejack replied. Clear blue skies up above him, a few stray clouds, some birds and leaves. Jet was greeted by a boot to the head and almost fell out of the blimp. One of the Royal Guards asked awaiting for the command</p>

<p>&quot;C&#39;mon, we&#39;re goin&#39; to the hospital.</p>

<p>&quot;How do I look?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came up with one an hour ago,&quot; Cadence said.</p>

<p>&quot;Cream!</p>

<p>As the introductions were made Tails remembered what he was going to show Sonic and invited them inside, but up above the glass ceiling was Dr. Twilight finished with a scream as Sonic and Rainbow ran into the barn at the exact same time, knocking the trio over.</p>

<p>Rainbow had the obvious advantage of flying, after all, having wings did kind of help. It could be just a feeling…Dash decided to visit Twilight anyways, just like friends do.</p>

<p>Babs and Applebloom was in Applebloom&#39;s room but it was dark with no source of light except the computer screen. So how are we gonna get a car? Whatever. said Sonic. Amy was winning at first.</p>

<p>Everyone faced each other to get ready for the heat of battle. He turned around. Twilight was trying to keep her balance as Knuckles kept on running into their kart.</p>

<p>Knuckles and Rouge was controlling the mini fly spy cam to get a good like at what Amy and Pinkie were doing</p>

<p>The ignition of a very large motor engine (gotcha, didn&#39;t I?). Mickey gulped. Calvin grabbed Hobbes and started to run. You won the Sword Clash Tournament! Knuckles obeyed Tails and started to punch at the glass door that concealed them from the outside. Did you lose badly?</p>

<p>The time of the Double Dash has come. She hides behind the corner, out of Amy&#39;s sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>No just sleepy mmm what if why how…&quot; The dazed and slightly insane Sonic dropped on the grass and began snoring his head off, with Knuckles literally bawling with laughter right beside him.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s for me to know and for you to find out.&quot;</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. Suddenly, the CMCs was racing down a dirt ramp and as the flew off the ramp, they crossed the finish line. Dash had sweat streaming down her face. I want to show you something in my room.</p>

<p>Rainbow was startled to find Fluttershy almost touching the animal, whatever it was. Look.</p>

<p>Not even close… I like to think that the characters control a story, and the narrator just tells the audience what happens in the story. said a female voice. They don&#39;t like each other like that.</p>

<p>Uh…ok! He put down his laptop on the table and carried rainbow to her bed then he went to bed.</p>

<p>Twilight ran to the bathroom to splash some water on her face. they yelled. He walked up to her but Shadow stopped him. When Cadence and Shining Armor, Twilight&#39;s big brother, got married, Shining gave Cadence a locket. Dash&#39;s dad asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Shadow!</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic!</p>

<p>Not even close… I like to think that the characters control a story, and the narrator just tells the audience what happens in the story. Dawn yelled. Rainbow burst out laughing. One by one, the ponies fell in. He said. He was even more confused when he found out that some of them could fly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Knuckles and Applejack were sipping a cool drink of cider. Megaman does sound good, but I might save him for later. Kiyo asked. Ash picked up the strange gem. Sonic thought to himself</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow looked at each other and Mario was right; they were cuddling. She stopped in front of the ponies. I don&#39;t care if it is computer drawn or hand drawn or crappy or good. he said squeakily. Sorr….hey, are you Blade?</p>

<p>Babs and Applebloom was in Applebloom&#39;s room but it was dark with no source of light except the computer screen. He took another bite of it. At the point where most of Rainbow&#39;s limbs were gone, rainbow, herself, started to freak out and panic.</p>

<p>Cream could have squealed as a lavender pony peaked out over Tails&#39; shoulder. We have somewhat similar writing styles, except she adds humor to hers. They all belong to their respectful owner (I&#39;m from the creators of Yu-Gi-Oh. I got a kart I used in the Sonic Drift Tournament. He always made pancakes whenever he was going to do something exciting with his machines. I can never beat her.</p>

<p>Amy sighed. They go into the janitor&#39;s closet in I was on my way to 2nd period last week and they didn&#39;t come out until it was 4th! She flew around at supersonic speed (she accidently charged at 5 people, causing them to wake up) to see where she was. He inquired, pointing at Rainbow.</p>

<p>Twilight had arrived back to her house. She was the most colorful of the bunch. Knuckles pointed towards a nurse near enough to him and whispered to Sonic. Zatch asked. It will be a bumpy ride but we&#39;ll have our fun along the way x3 The bottom of each story will always be my Authors note so make sure to read it! They must be….</p>

<p>Sonic&#39;s mind swelled with rage. It was the song he heard out of nowhere (as far as he could tell) when Metal Sonic, Eggman&#39;s most successful copy of him, went berserk and tried to take over the world with an iron fist… no pun intended.</p>

<p>Dash was horrified at what she was reading. Fluttershy screamed and fell over in fright at the terrible, monstrous, EVIL…shadow of a tree. Discord said, with a pained voice. Shadow then looked at the ceiling trying to find me. We have somewhat similar writing styles, except she adds humor to hers. But anyways, I got my 2 friends proof-reading this so I&#39;m cool xD </p>

<p>&#39;Cause I know in my heart babe</p>

<p>Amy tasted the cupcake and her pupils started to dilate. She froze his shadow, causing him to be stuck, for one cannot move without their shadow moving too. It was a gem with a music note inside, and a heart covered microphone bursting out of it.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not true right?&quot;</p>

<p>Who IS that saying everything we do!?&quot;</p>

<p>sonic was standing by the food stand, eating a chili dog. Confetti and balloons was falling around them and lights was shone on the little girls. Cream asked as she holds Fluttershy. Twilight gave her an inquisitive look, and then smiled.</p>

<p>Spike stared at me for a moment, before dashing out of the room. said Twilight, although secretly it was not just for the library at all…</p>

<p>&quot;Guys!</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah… but how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had some business to take care of in the next town,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s gotta be an explosion,&quot; Sora said as he fell down.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m so flattered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heh…Hey Vector…any good at driving Extreme Gear?&quot;</p>

<p>Sonic held the flashlight while rainbow used the pliers to retrieve the object in flutter&#39;s throat. He was just about to take a HUGE bite when suddenly a large flash of blue erupted from the house. It was worth it! xD </p>

<p>There was a city. Meanwhile, Tails and Twilight tried to use their evidence they had gathered so far (Two Chaos Emeralds and Two Explosions) to try and piece together what was going on with the failed experiment.</p>

<p>Rainbow was waiting for Sonic at Canterlot Castle. Knuckles asked? It was worth it! He knock on the door and was answered by a little girl in a orange shirt and purple hair.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more hunger then Timber Wolf that hasn&#39;t ate in 3 days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NOOO!</p>

<p>Mind kicking Vector awake before we answer your questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me, he thought that if I were alone he would have a chance to finish me off, but thanks to these two here we sent him flying, so what was it that you wanted to show me Tails?&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, I still can&#39;t believe magic even EXISTS!&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone faced each other to get ready for the heat of battle. The two were blinded by all the bright lights and the attractions the city had to offer. Oh well. Tails leapt out of his fur as Amy screamed at the mention of Sonic. And her skin was… well you get the picture.</p>

<p>They was gaining up on Twilight and Fluttershy</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous summer day. I got everything down. So, afterschool?</p>

<p>Cream mumbled in reply and practically dragged Wave downstairs so that she could get to work on identifying what had gone wrong and if Sonic and Co. He inquired, pointing at Rainbow.</p>

<p>Tails got out of the shower and began to dry himself. Maybe I can call Bailey to came! Just then, it glowed. That sounded seriously wrong, I know.</p>

<p>Mario went back inside but hasn&#39;t come back out in 20 minutes. We will continue this at my place. Brock asked. He grabbed the roots of a carrot and pulled until it came out. You can do this. Chow on this.</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Only you&#39;re a human</h2>

<p>Hello, and welcome back to The Pony Parable!</p>

<p>College is tough these days and sonic and rainbow knows firsthand. Your bring powers in this then I&#39;m gamed! He hated waiting. replied Rainbow.</p>

<p>Calvin&#39;s eyes were glued to the TV as he ate a bowl of his favorite cereal. Sally cringed. When sonic got up he saw a guy in a mask with no features to it, except the visor which covered his entire face.</p>

<p>Both of them went to their own rooms. Aura asked while rubbing his head in pain</p>

<p>Ditzy Doo flew onto the traffic light, but it took her awhile due to her crashing into everything. Do you think they would have told us? The two reasons that they had planned the trip in the first place is because of the fact that they missed him, and they had a LOT of spare time on their hands. Everyone turned around to see the witch of all evil. I own nothing (BTW if you read the Shadow! Wait yay!</p>

<p>&quot;Nice way of greeting somebody…&quot; Cream said.</p>

<p>The library might have some answers to his teleportation dilemma.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that seriously his name?</p>

<p>NO DONUTS FOR YOU!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tails…I&#39;m going to tell you something that you can&#39;t tell ANYONE else, ok?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous summer day. Mickey looked over to left and saw something odd. Silver shouted.</p>

<p>It was Monday and the students had the day off. What the….</p>

<p>Good point. what kind of test are we talking about?</p>

<p>-Twilight thinking some more about her completely love-oblivious fox</p>

<p>Twilight ran to the bathroom to splash some water on her face. We are supposed to have an open-mike night. He had no idea where to go, he had no map so he couldn&#39;t get back to Sweet Apple Acres and to make it worse, he couldn&#39;t even talk to anyone without getting called a freak. Twilight asked. And he has a mustache and a red hat with an M. Cream said weakly, half laughing, half in tears at her demise which was soon to come.</p>

<p>(Mild adult joke in the fourth paragraph! Mario opened the door while in his PJs</p>

<p>Tails took one look at Vector and sighed. She was more powerful in her stride than he ever saw. She took a seat directly in front of him so they can be face to face. At the mention of her name Pinkie shot up.</p>

<p>Babs and Applebloom was in Applebloom&#39;s room but it was dark with no source of light except the computer screen. Mickey was thinking &#39;I have the feeling that that jewel would help her. He&#39;s a nice boy. Tails landed with a loud BAM on the sand. There was a lot this girl had in common with Rainbow it was sickening. Applejack hiccoughed as she stumbled across the barn.</p>

<p>Amy pressed the button and launched the bomb towards Cream and Rouge. He noticed that his fur was all over the place. I&#39;m the only one she trust and loves.</p>

<p>Tails happily shakes it and puts on a smile &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She&#39;s the one who nurses me and to be honest, first time I was brought in here it looked as if she wanted to call a VET instead of a doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My tail is twitching!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I thought I&#39;d just make a cup of tea for you and Sonic…&quot; Twilight said, pointing her hoof over to the blue hedgehog resting back in a chair, sipping a perfectly normal cup of tea.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Sonic, Sonic the Hedgehog, The Fastest Thing Alive&quot;</p>

<p>A few hours later, Tails woke up. Tails is a nice boy and you are a nice girl. Rarity said. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. Maybe I should change the rating xD)</p>

<p>Dash was horrified at what she was reading. Sonic was coming up on two turns, he slowly stopped, one of the turns would lead him towards Tails&#39; workshop. sonic</p>

<p>Well I think I did a bit ok on my first time publishing a fanfic. Rarity asked Sonic to look after Sweetie Belle, saying she wasn&#39;t supposed to go anywhere outside a two hundred foot radius of Sonic. That was the most Normal thing Dash heard from him all day.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Jet.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know as well I do I suck at riding anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll explain later, first we have to round everypony up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, YES!&quot;</p>

<p>Babs and Applebloom was in Applebloom&#39;s room but it was dark with no source of light except the computer screen. Evil Aaron is EVIL!</p>

<p>Tails got out of the shower and began to dry himself. But by the look of the beach, it wasn&#39;t her home. Don&#39;t talk about…..uh-oh not again! How do you stop this…Eggman, whenever he causes trouble?</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Sora and Oswald asked. Twilight whispered to Tails. I would opened it at my place because she was drunk when she made that.</p>

<p>They went to the subway were Tails worked at. Applejack shouted. For 2 reasons. Bear in mind that I am not a brony and six is not a pegasister so rainbow and her friends might be OOC. Roxas says. As Applejack had said, there was nothing special although bucking season WAS coming up soon and they had so many apples that she was worried she might a have a repeat of last year…she didn&#39;t want to think about the lack of sleep she got from that season!</p>

<p>-Lunchroom-</p>

<p>Everyone was looking at Sonic in shock. Mickey yelled as he sat up. It didn&#39;t take the pony genius to regulate Tails was happier than usual.</p>

<p>Amanda arrived at the school entrance. Rainbow had it. Mickey looked at him with a cause glare. Megumi asked. Just then Twilight Sparkle came in to the living room area, the heart of the Library. She ran over and could have hugged him because of what she found but Tails stared at her and held her back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jet was confused at the fact that there were ponies around. And the Elements were sucked in. Sonic asked Twilight. It&#39;s a longshot, but a shot nonetheless.</p>

<p>Cream stared at him. Mario ran out the door and saw a red glow. Her eyes were watering. Tails gasped.</p>

<p>There was a hard banging on the door. Sonic asked. He took another bite of it. Applejack and Applebloom asked. Rainbow said. That&#39;s when we first met!</p>

<p>Everyone cheered for her and carried her off</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t a sound in Ponyville as the sunlight rose over the horizon slowly. Just wait. Sonic asked. REALLY?!</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. The head of a blue stallion rose out of the ruble. I got a bomb put inside of me for my last resort that I can detonate at anytime! It&#39;s a lot different from what I&#39;m used to.</p>

<p>Pinkie went up to Amy and grabbed her glove, seeing a tiny needle on the index finger part of the glove.</p>

<p>Twilight was startled at Tails&#39; sudden outburst at the rabbit. Sonic had always been like this. Plus I will pay them back!</p>

<p>Zatch looked at the clock. Even if he had no clue who she is, he felt sorry for her. Her feet with out of her shoes, which was a tell-tell sign that she wanted to play footsie. Don&#39;t try anything to hurt rainbow, alright?</p>

<p>She turns on the aiming screen and grabbed the control stick. She became worried and flew off for Fluttershy&#39;s cottage. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. In front of them was some kind of dinosaur, turtle, and dragon thing. And really he couldn&#39;t come up with anything better to call himself than that.</p>

<p>I awoke to someone poking me. Oswald gave Mickey a noggin. Fluttershy&#39;s eyes grew wide. He jumped in with the emerald. After what felt like hours of climbing, they finally reached the summit.</p>

<p>Silver walked into the Nurse&#39;s office and sat by Fluttershy&#39;s bed. AMY!</p>

<p>She goes to the door to see slender man standing on the other side and the screen started fizzing</p>

<p>Vector let out a cry and a shout. Mario eye&#39;s shrunk. Fine, what do you want?</p>

<p>He finally reached the spot where it landed, and was surprised to see that there was a dent in it. Why are we here? Knuckles&#39; dreadlocks was purple (to its normal red color) had a fake mustache and is wearing lederhosen. By yourself?</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. They were also stomping the beat of We Will Rock You. He knows of that voice. Ash answered. Come on, I dare you) &#39;She&#39;s lying. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>Amanda arrived at the school entrance. The creatures and Discord looked over at us. The bell is about to ring!</p>

<p>Done and done! They all nodded, and as he did so he pressed a large button on his console. Rainbow said, laughing a little at the yellow pony&#39;s reaction.</p>

<p>There was a city. Susie turned around and did the same thing as Calvin, run for their life. All the sudden, a portal opened. He got into his room and got his shoes on. Sonic immediately hopped on his laptop.</p>

<p>Rainbow was surveying Ponyville, looking for a certain blue hedgehog to have some fun with. They walked away chowing down on their meal. He just left the cart there and just left quietly.</p>

<p>Sonic and friends entered the shop and ordered their favorite drinks. I&#39;ll give you some time to think). Sadly the 2 kids and the stuff tiger got sucked in. Sorry.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; RD answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!</p>

<p>&quot;Er…the one…y&#39;know?</p>

<p>&quot;No way!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like they are your brother and sister,&quot; Mickey said.</p>

<p>&quot;AHA!</p>

<p>They arrived at Fluttershy&#39;s house and were in no way surprised to see her feeding her animals outside her house. Numbers and letter flashed up onto the screen positioned next to the pod.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re mighty impressive too for an animal that wears clothes,&quot; Applejack says as she starts walk away.</p>

<p>-Meanwhile, on Mt. Luigi asked. Just then Twilight Sparkle came in to the living room area, the heart of the Library. in store...</p>

<p>Meep. I was so caught up with the cheering and applauding, that no one realised I had used chaos control, until it was too late. He jumped into the portal to save them. (no offense, loremaster XD) ~mb6</p>

<p>Inside the blimp was the trio of Babylon Rogues. We don&#39;t even have a robot to work on! The finish line for the course was set at the far end of a Grind Rail. SONIC! Especially with his avatar&#39;s Transformation into a human. Amy, can&#39;t you stand up for yourself?</p>

<p>Knuckles and Rouge was at the door in a new look and Amy didn&#39;t notice them. He heard Dash yell.</p>

<p>Rainbow was talking to Applejack about getting Sonic a job, and letting him stay for half the profit he&#39;d make. When they returned, a certain pink-haired girl came out of the bathroom, looking eye-to-eye at rainbow.</p>

<p>Applebloom and Babs does so and they hopped on. community college were hanging around the Mall of Harbor City. Sonic asked. Fluttershy smiled warmly at Cream and Cream felt her heart melt inside, and even though she was afraid of most ponies, she felt her fear wash away in cuteness.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright flash of light knocked Tails back into Sonic. Megumi squealed. One of the Royal Guards asked awaiting for the command</p>

<p>Then Pinkie&#39;s ears started flopping, her legs started shacking, and her eyes went batty (In that order). Hello Twilight! Twilight and the gang gasped and ran to the window…to find absolutely nothing. Said a low, loud voice. XD</p>

<p>Cream facepalmed, and rang the doorbell.</p>

<p>While they were clean around the bathroom area, they encountered one of the popular teens, Scourge. But even as she flew to Twilight&#39;s house she realised it would be stupid to visit Twilight about something even herself didn&#39;t know what it was. Rainbow Dash flew on over to Rouge. I&#39;m the only one she trust and loves.</p>

<p>GIVE IT TO ME!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there&#39;s a pony called Applejack who works on a farm.</p>

<p>When he got downstairs, he stopped dead in his tracks. Mickey screamed at the 2 humans and the cat. Oswald questioned. And…uh…someone else? Thanks.</p>

<p>Pinkie Pie gasped. Soon the cheeks that kept the jaw from hitting the dirt went up in a smile that would make Pinkie Pie jealous of how big Sonic made Scootaloo smile.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walked to their next class. Hobbes is usually seen as a stuff tiger and Calvin sees him as real tiger. Her pillow was wet; maybe because of the dream she just had which left her crying. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. Pinkie asked. The crowd groaned at this</p>

<p>She gasped as she saw someone she knew very well come out of the building. We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. Shadow asked. He swept Dash off her feet, and ran as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Yet, as she flew through the clouds, pushing them away as to cause a sunny day for the townspeople, she felt something was up. Aura asked out of nowhere</p>

<p>Knuckles grabbed Applejack and put her in his arms while he glided down to safety. Sadly the 2 kids and the stuff tiger got sucked in. But not before Pinkie had a meltdown and jumped all over the place.</p>

<p>Tails was finished working on the teleportation machine. Discord... Shadow make&#39;s a good drink.</p>

<p>Spike ran towards Discord. Meaning? Each fanfic writers always changes something here and there, it what give fics a little extra kick in quality. Mickey couldn&#39;t stop thinking about. And a Pink hedgehog?</p>

<p>Rarity was trying her hardest to look fashionable but anything was 20% harder with Pinkie Pie around. She uses her magic to open her settle bag. all rights goes to their respective owners!</p>

<p>Since today was Saturday, the teens of T.J. Pinkie said. Tails started but before he could finish he was interrupted by a large bang that occurred outside the machine. It had a blue stone in the ground. REALLY?!</p>

<p>Amy tasted the cupcake and her pupils started to dilate. They walked across a log in the middle of a stream. He thought he heard moaning behind him and RD. DO IT!</p>

<p>Twilight and Applejack were very confused. Twilight calmed down a little. Rarity yells. It made Sonic double over in fear.</p>

<p>Rainbow was surveying Ponyville, looking for a certain blue hedgehog to have some fun with. Thanks and wish us luck.</p>

<p>The CMCs got back into their places and drove off</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Truth be told this kind of thing has never been done before… I&#39;m glad it worked out for the better</h2>

<p>-The next day-</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, where are Bunnie, Rotor and Antione?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Told us what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Applejack alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!</p>

<p>&quot;Please, rise up&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone went to their homes to get some rest to start the Chaos Emerald Search tomorrow, Aura followed Applejack to her families apple farm and Sonic followed Rainbow Dash to her cloud home at an incredible speed. Pinkie Pie was slurping on Diet soda. Sonic asked.</p>

<p>So, what had been going on in Mobius? The ball of quills stopped muttering immediately and uncurled itself to find a kind looking pony standing over him. she said. he said. According to eyewitnesses, the explosion lasted maybe only 3 to 5 seconds, which wasn&#39;t that interesting.</p>

<p>Rainbow was there when Sonic last met Necromius. She was singing some type of heavy metal sing. So did the Elements of Harmony. Then the figure holding the Sword came out of hiding, like a chameleon showing itself, from its hiding spot.</p>

<p>Mario went back inside but hasn&#39;t come back out in 20 minutes. He quietly opened the door and came in. It was surrounded by wires, panels, nuts and bolts and assorted other things. Spiked yelled. EAH! Said the now-hyperventilating-and curled-up-into-a-corner Sonic.</p>

<p>Silver walked into the Nurse&#39;s office and sat by Fluttershy&#39;s bed. When Cadence and Shining Armor, Twilight&#39;s big brother, got married, Shining gave Cadence a locket. And Ash clearly stated that Pokémon only say there name. Burning and falling to pieces. Twilight looked at RD&#39;s new friends. If I pass out, I want you to take my body and RUN LIKE HELL!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonic had stopped directly in the centre of Ponyville after a mad race through Equestria trying to lose Amy. Zatch asked. Mickey asked. They all waved. Let it go already!</p>

<p>Sonic, Tails and Pinkie walked over to the Carousel Boutique and Sonic opened the door. How did you make it? Thanks again, and adios!</p>

<p>3…</p>

<p>Max engulfed Aura in a telekinetic grip that safely put him out of harms way, Sonic saw this as an opportunity to take down Eggman while he&#39;s distracted, without getting noticed he quickly used his Sonic Boost to knock the robot down to the ground. It took that one comment for Sonic to remember everything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Twilight stumbled over the last word. They have their own karts and partner. Twilight was getting most of the estates while Sonic and Rainbow only had a few, due to them not knowing how to play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the library, Tails was examining the Chaos Emerald. Tails walked out in a black tuxedo and a white undershirt and a black bow-tie. Knuckles turned to Tails</p>

<p>Behind a line drawn by Pikachu, Sonic and Dash were getting ready. I might be able to do something with it&#39;s power to try and find the others. The Chandelier. Rarity? Twilight jumped on the table and rainbow flew into the back room and came back with a shotgun in hand.</p>

<p>Celestia charge up her power. Amy was lying on the ground when the smoke cleared and Pinkie had dust on her face.</p>

<p>Since today was Saturday, the teens of T.J. They walked into Twilight&#39;s Library. It glowed rapidly. Fluttershy said in a sort of mumble. was the reply.</p>

<p>Apparently, she was one of the victims of the explosion that happened just now!&quot;</p>

<p>Rainbow went to the food stand to grab some snacks. A dinosaur and 2 Italian man. Her feet with out of her shoes, which was a tell-tell sign that she wanted to play footsie. Sonic ran off so fast that all that was left was a blue streak.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow walking into Pinkie&#39;s dorm and Pinkie and Amy was baking sweets for Mr. You and your friends are mutant animals, which makes sense why you&#39;re talking. After he fainted many Guards came in to protect their princess and surrounded the two supposed threats, but then they heard a voice commanding them to halt in their position.</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. I bet Rarity can get you something. It keeps me busy. She wore a black and purple robe. No one most know.</p>

<p>Cream stared at him. Then Amy and Cream had to bail you out and lifted all of your changes with their lifesavings</p>

<p>Sonic realized that this was the third body he had, and possibly the third name. If we do this thing successful, we can get the scope on Amy and Pinkie. So did the Elements of Harmony. Sonic already placed are order for Papa Johns.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, the genius Knucklehead FINALLY find out!</p>

<p>&quot;Wow Spike, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing this!</p>

<p>They arrived at Fluttershy&#39;s house and were in no way surprised to see her feeding her animals outside her house. The mouse is Mickey Mouse. Rarity is almost done with her song.</p>

<p>After about a week on four legs, Sonic had trouble getting back on two feet. As usual, Rainbow Dash got up around so she could push away some clouds before lunch. Knuckles was interrupted by Applejacks hoof in his mouth, and then he was pulled onto her back. Let it go already!</p>

<p>Then another guy came floating down. Just push your head through. She flew over to her. But just as the glass shattered another bang occurred, knocking Knuckles back into the others. When we get near it, both of you jump back here with me!</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Mario yelled. She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. Rainbow Dash asked. But….</p>

<p>Everyone got into a circle and Pinkie brought a empty coke bottle. Mario nodded. Everyone laughed. community college were hanging around the Mall of Harbor City. So Tails gave him the directions and Knuckles was off.</p>

<p>Dash felt something pull at her heart that made her follow him. Actually, Shad is in the audience spying on Luna XD</p>

<p>Luna handed them a silver trophy filled with 3000$. Tails jogged upstairs and made some pancakes. Rainbow didn&#39;t come due to Amy pouring hot sauce on Rainbow&#39;s pizza and Rainbow didn&#39;t notice. GO! She opened her purple reddish eyes to see where she is. All of these question raced through the ponies heads as they ran outside to see if anypony knew what happened.</p>

<p>Go steal Sonics if you have tooooooo!</p>

<p>&quot;We should really get back to the story now Shadow,&quot; Pinkie said.</p>

<p>&quot;So the red emerald went your place,&quot; Sonic says.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s where the Stonecutter&#39;s quill and the magic lies.&quot;</p>

<p>When Rainbow made it to her room, she closed the door and burst laughing for a good 5 minutes. He called. He opened up the very same bottle of maple syrup he had used that morning-and plunged the contents of it into the sink.</p>

<p>As soon as Blade was in front of Amanda, she rolled under him and slashed his back.</p>

<p>Sonic jumped over the crowd and started to run. It made Sonic double over in fear.</p>

<p>MENTION IT ONCE MORE AND I WILL SET TAILS FREE!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should turn the sand into ice.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s a village…like, 2 metres to your right.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it too late to ask another engineer?&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Oh lighten up Max we got this&quot; Aura said feeling confident and then looks at Sonic &quot; Hey bud do you want to sit this one out or do you want to scramble some eggs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So uh…what do you do around here?&quot;</p>

<p>Pleasure to meet you!&quot;</p>

<p>HE&#39;S GOING TO TALK IN THAT DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AGAIN AND MY HEAD WILL BURST IF HE DOES!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet they are bringing in some of their henchmen and obstacles for us to fight,&quot; Dr.</p>

<p>Trixie pinned him down to ground with her magic. Ms. Applebloom says. It definitely wasn&#39;t Chris&#39; world and nor was it his. Either of us are taking it lightly. He made a mental note to eat some chocolate next to Sonic…in a locked room.</p>

<p>Phew, done! Mickey was thinking &#39;I have the feeling that that jewel would help her. There was no sunlight streaming through, the darkness only looming around. I cannot focus at all with my wings popping out at random times. Whoa! Few minutes later, Tails arrived in his car, looking fancy.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?</p>

<p>You guys have a feeling something&#39;s going to happen as WELL as us?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh by the way I got a new name for this body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you didn&#39;t ask either, so…&quot; Tails ignored this quarrel and turned to Sonic.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d like to get a look at the rest of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; he whimpered.</p>

<p>Sonic was going to Canterlot High for about a week when the spirit of the Fall Formal came around. He said that something unimaginable was just behind the mirror, and still sent Sonic to that world under Queen Chrysalis&#39; advice.</p>

<p>&quot;Hugh, my head…&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p>Celestia charge up her power. We both have to go to school and I can take care of her. We were in a forest of some sort, the trees covered in prickly vines waiting for someone to touch it, wanting to draw blood. Sonic was speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I think that makes senses, due to their speech.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;WOOHOOOOOO!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before we met Sonic, we happened to have come across Eggman trying to crush Sonic with his giant mechanical robot&quot; &quot;Really?</p>

<p>Continuing on! And one more thing, I am going to have a poll on what is going to be my next stories. The Pegasus turned his attention to Sonic. Twilight calmed down a little. When her and Sonic got to the rooms, however, things go bad.</p>

<p>&quot;For now tend to their wounds and when they regain consciousness bring them here, in the meantime I will send a message to my student to gather her friends and arrive here in Canterlot&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look Rainbow, I just really don&#39;t like the forest it kinda…creeps me out a li-WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT!?&quot;</p>

<p>A gem brought you here?&quot;</p>

<p>TWILIIIIII-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Calm down Twilight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s my dad&#39;s first pen.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Applejack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, girls?</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the library, Twilight was startled to see Tails&#39; bed empty. Celestia, Luna and Candence were the judges. Sora asked slamming the door open. That&#39;s my line! he was disgusted at what he saw. they said.</p>

<p>Can you please make me some of that calming herbal tea, so I can focus? The music suddenly stops. She was about to quietly celebrate, when she heard a loud crash from the edge of the Everfree Forest. They started to run, but was sucked in. He just left the cart there and just left quietly.</p>

<p>Trixie got mad and threw her Gameboy at Silver, which hit him in the head. The two were blinded by all the bright lights and the attractions the city had to offer. The man had the same shirt, gloves, and boots like the woman, but had white pants. He started to rub his arms. Then emeralds stop glowing. You go.</p>

<p>It was morning over in Mobius. He fell down from its branches with a crash and landed in a heap on the ground. Both dragon and pony hadn&#39;t a clue what was going on and pondered over this strange feeling, but were startled when a knock on the door took them out of their &#39;thinking coma&#39;. Tails squealed and half-ran to the stairs. Where am I? Celestia had finished the letter and sent it to a little town called Ponyville.</p>

<p>Tails and the others laughed at Rainbows statement, and Tails adjusted a spring in his machine. It was almost time for her to start worrying. So desperate the ponies were to get away from this freak that they didn&#39;t realise they had walked into a sleeping red…echidna? yelled a voice. Cream and Calvin said. Did you lose badly?</p>

<p>A few hours later, Tails woke up. The hedgehogs asked in unison</p>

<p>The Royal Guards carried the two fainted hedgehogs with their magic bringing them to the infirmary, while Celestia began writing a letter to her faithful student Twilight Sparkle. Mind If I can spend the night?</p>

<p>The crowd cheered and clapped</p>

<p>Twilight got out and waited at the door for Tails, while Fluttershy drove off. SONIC! There was no one in the crowd who didn&#39;t wait for a minute after the song was over before they started clapping. Brock fell in. No and WHAT?! Vector said cheerfully, and jumped straight through Tails&#39; window.</p>

<p>There was somepony in front of him. Tails groaned. These aren&#39;t like the animals to take care of! Everyone just relax except Twilight, who was pacing around sweating.</p>

<p>Unknown does so</p>

<p>&quot;ONE!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, I only just woke up 10 minutes ago.</p>

<p>&quot;HELP ME&quot; click it</p>

<p>And-they-can-walk-and-oh-my-I-must-get-some-food-t hey-must-be-hungry-wow-I-cannot-believe i-&quot; &quot;Flutter!</p>

<p>Trixie and Silver made their way to the hotel. The portal started to close! Can&#39;t you steer that thing?</p>

<p>Spike ran towards Discord. I&#39;M SO SORRY! Tails gasped.</p>

<p>The racers had time before the actual race happens, so they are just chilling and enjoy the fair. Mickey pulled out his paintbrush. Oswald, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are toons, which is what Mickey told me. asked a rabbit. &#39;Ah man. She placed the plate on the table and knuckles grab the rainbow cupcake and took a bite out of it.</p>

<p>It was the groups first full day in Equestria, yet even in a different world, Tails was still horrible at getting up in the morning. Mickey gulped. There was a dragon with nine ponies. I have another idea!</p>

<p>&quot;Zatch, do you always eat Yellow Tail?&quot;</p>

<p>He&#39;s good with machines, but not much of a fight-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Howd&#39;ya think I feel?&quot;</p>

<p>What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic, I only just woke up 10 minutes ago.</p>

<p>&quot;I REALLY HATE THAT HEDGEHOG!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you wish your majesty&quot; The guard said bowing in respect</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, YES!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OH, SSSOOONNNIIICCC!&quot;</p>

<p>IT TALKED TOO!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Shadow,&quot; Applejack says.</p>

<p>&quot;I had some business to take care of in the next town,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Can you give me an example?&quot;</p>

<p>Are you alright!?&quot;</p>

<p>When Rainbow made it to her room, she closed the door and burst laughing for a good 5 minutes. He charges towards his foes but they all dodged with ease.</p>

<p>Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energyLet me show you just what I&#39;m made ofSimple curiosity, tries to take a bite of meLet me show you just what I&#39;m made of now...</p>

<p>Rainbow Dash here didn&#39;t BOTHER to tell me…&quot; Sonic said.</p>

<p>well lets see&quot; Twilight said taking the letter with her magic</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You landed here too!&quot;</p>

<p>After the explosion occurred, 3 eyewitnesses with very good eyesight saw 4 &quot;objects&quot; fall from the sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Meh, it&#39;s nothing.</p>

<p>-Aaron</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Necromius!</h2>

<p>Before Dash met Silver and Shadow officially, she took Fluttershy and Pinkie to the nurse for what looked like collapse from exhaustion.</p>

<p>&quot;How are we going to get ANYWHERE in this world.</p>

<p>&quot;Sonic!&quot;</p>

<p>Sincerely Princess Celestia&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind Sonic,&quot; Tails whispered to Twilight.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s 100 IQ points over &quot;Complete and utter GENIUS!&quot;</p>

<p>We got into MLP and we came across this one thing called a &quot;clopfic&quot;.</p>

<p>How many times did you save her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well Storm is about 7 tonnes in weight and Jet probably has bones as brittle as Cream&#39;s cookies whenever she bakes…&quot; he received a smack in the face from the rabbit for his ignorance.</p>

<p>Tails and the others were knocked out for only 2 minutes but to them it felt like hours. Just then, beings came falling down from them. Tails said. I might be able to do something with it&#39;s power to try and find the others. Celestia, Luna and Candence were the judges. She cursed the portal for giving her bad eyesight.</p>

<p>Dash was horrified at what she was reading. When I saw it, I spat out my tea. Later, Sonic and Dash were talking at Fluttershy&#39;s which still had the big hole in it after Sonic&#39;s run-in with it. said Pinkie with a cheerful smile and pulled Amy&#39;s cupcake into her hoof and handed it to Amy. He huffed and puffed heavily. But not before Pinkie had a meltdown and jumped all over the place.</p>

<p>Tails and Sonic were just relaxing in Twilight&#39;s kitchen, chatting moderately. Pikachu fell in as well. He looked to see another alicorn that had mane the color of the night sky with the stars. Tails let everyone else walk in while he typed in some numbers to a console on the side of the door. She was in the infirmary now checking up on them, and then Shadow walked in looking shocked.</p>

<p>Luna handed them a silver trophy filled with 3000$. It wasn&#39;t tiny; it was around the same size as Rainbow. While he got into the shower the fox suddenly remembered why he had set his alarm clock to an insanely early time. She has lavender and pink streaks in her purple hair. He yelled as he threw two Pokeballs at Sonic and RD. Elise said this could boost up my confidence</p>

<p>&quot;Here goes&quot; Tails said revealing the teleporter &quot;Whoah&quot; &quot;This is my dimensional teleporter&quot; Tails explained</p>

<p>Sonic takes a bit out of the cupcake and then pauses for a second. She ran into the gym and took a seat next to silver.</p>

<p>Cream was stuck with Vector and Espio. Ash asked. We love him</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not Tails, but I&#39;m pretty sure that clouds push THEMSELVES you know…&quot;</p>

<p>Eggman&#39;s evil schemes&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Put a straw in a cup, and suck it up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Calvin told Susie.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, they were at the park. Mickey lowered his head. Apparently ponies are the superior race here in Equestria. Sonic smirked at me, whilst Silver was cheering me on with the rest of the gang. Calvin and Susie were on the right. She calmed down though and the two set off on a quest to try and find Wave the Swallow.</p>

<p>Later on that day, everyone was working in the gym for the open mic night. said a female voice. Can you PM me your story?</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles slid into the mud. It had a big carrier device in the middle that could easily fit 7-10 people. he asked.</p>

<p>Sonic focused his mind around the spotlight and it was engulfed with light blue aura. Let&#39;s start off me. She had a bathing suit on, white gloves, amber like eyes, and a cream like skin. She told me something about &#39;Keepers&#39;. And by that I mean he charged at Metal, who just raised his hoof and punched him into the mirror behind him. Sonic saw Trixie and Unknown in the ring of Pokémon fans, talking about the Gameboy games.</p>

<p>Spike ran towards Discord. Burning and falling to pieces. They were having guys night out and few nights ago before Tails&#39; date. Rarity? Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Cream sighed. Just then Twilight Sparkle came in to the living room area, the heart of the Library. His hair was up in spikes, and would occasionally get in his face. NO! It could be just a feeling…Dash decided to visit Twilight anyways, just like friends do.</p>

<p>FINALLY YAY! Sonic asked. ;D</p>

<p>Scootaloo was speechless, her eyes wide and her jaw dropped. my... You seem so familiar it aint even funny.</p>

<p>Spike stared at me for a moment, before dashing out of the room. His hair was up in spikes, and would occasionally get in his face. Yoshi lives in kingdom with talking mushrooms. She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. She&#39;s literally a horse, a Pegasus to be exact. Yeah right…</p>

<p>&quot;Party!?&quot;</p>

<p>I read a little about the fox yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>Pinkie answered, &quot;That something was going to fall!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should turn the sand into ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Twilight!</p>

<p>I caught some of it though…&quot;chocolate…plan…Sonic…crazy?...&quot;.</p>

<p>Applejack watched from the side-lines as Tails and Twilight geeked over each others technological knowledge. Right now, I am in cream&#39;s mom&#39;s car on the way to school. Twilight said inquisitively. She could get in the way of Tails, and then she would be left alone, with no partn-</p>

<p>She gave a small squeal of fright. He quietly opened the door and came in. Sonic! SHADOW! On the way to the complex, rainbow&#39;s stomach started to growl uncomfortably, but she shook it off. DerpySquidsRule, Nichimon&#39;s hornless sister, compared to the Alicorn Nichie was, stared at Discord, a look of shame and pity in her eyes.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Fluttershy and Twilight was at Sonic&#39;s apartment. She got a bit closer to the vent of the Janitor&#39;s closet.</p>

<p>Twilight began reading the letter from her beloved ruler and mentor, it said</p>

<p>The ignition of a very large motor engine (gotcha, didn&#39;t I?). She hadn&#39;t seen Twilight, Celestia, Cadence, Luna, or Sonic in half a day. She was talking with Ash. Luckily, Mickey ran in front of them to block the fire from the kids. 10 seconds flat later, she was done. According to eyewitnesses, the explosion lasted maybe only 3 to 5 seconds, which wasn&#39;t that interesting.</p>

<p>After the initial shock of the explosion had set in, Sonic and Rainbow agreed to run around for eyewitnesses to see where the anthros had landed. Hobbes was reading a comic book. Brock fell in. She&#39;s literally a horse, a Pegasus to be exact. I DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING!</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles slid into the mud. Tails laughed, and sunk his head into the syrup.</p>

<p>Sonic and rainbow put their stuff in the room pinkie gave them. It had only been a day since the heroes (and Amy) had left Mobius and only a few people had noticed their strange absence, but had took it as a holiday. He will perform….</p>

<p>Sonic takes a bit out of the cupcake and then pauses for a second. And by that I mean he charged at Metal, who just raised his hoof and punched him into the mirror behind him. It was a purple emerald. Oh, hey guys!</p>

<p>All three drivers floored their karts to the fastest they can go. Tails stated. One of them completely opened his eyes. Rainbow followed him, although she was stunned. But she was completely thrown off by his answer.</p>

<p>DONE DONE DONE HMMMM YES. It&#39;s been two days since he disappeared, but Sonic was having trouble coming up with a strategy for the next time they met. When they were all downstairs, Tails walked over to the side of the oddly shaped machine. As Sonic and Rainbow Dash arrived at her home they quickly went to bed with Sonic sleeping on the couch, but Rainbow didn&#39;t allow him to.</p>

<p>Sonic was attending central middle school and got news that a new girl was transferring to his home room from Cloudsdale. He saw some people waking up. ZILCH! Yes I am getting it for the 3ds.</p>

<p>Rouge maneuvers the fly to door and tries to find a crack in the wall or door. Over next to a blue house, a rabbit decided to get some breakfast. Peach&#39;s voice seemed too echoed in his mind. I&#39;ll pay</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll stick around for more of the story! No matter how they look!</p>

<p>Tails had been frightened to death by the sudden appearance of the two ponies and had tugged on one of his appendages. Tails said with a smile.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles was sitting in first period waiting for class to start. She started to run away but was sucked in instead. A portal, well six portals to be exact. Silver walked in the middle of the classroom and began to spoke.</p>

<p>There was something about this Sonic guy that Dash just found interesting. Oh well, time to move on and get writing because Fatboy Slim is DISTRACTING ME.</p>

<p>Both of them jumped in his closet and cranked the door open. Then he saw Princess Cadence walk to the front of the Crowd. Saying this caused a flash of blinding white light. Rainbow Dash noticed tears in his eyes. I&#39;m good!</p>

<p>Applebloom and Babs does so and they hopped on. THAT&#39;S MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS! Megumi squealed. You want to be a cheerleader?</p>

<p>Sonic was going to Canterlot High for about a week when the spirit of the Fall Formal came around. Everyone suddenly went skyrocketing to the sky. It&#39;s a new cupcake recipe Mr. he was disgusted at what he saw. Luigi? Now where is it…there!</p>

<p>DONE DONE DONE HMMMM YES. He did the super peel-out to get out of the way, but Sonic his guard down and got hit by her horn blast. Her mane and tail were straight and had a highlight the color of her fur while the rest was violet.</p>

<p>Everyone was looking at Sonic in shock. Sonic took off with no explanation after the precious gem, speeding through the damp fields with no care, just the need to find that emerald. What does it mean?&#39; He saw Silver and Trixie in a position which I can&#39;t explain because seven want me to keep this fic at a T rating XD. She smiled and wanted to go back to her room, but that nightmare of hers will keep happening.</p>

<p>&quot;We all are,&quot; Fluttershy says in her quiet voice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll show them I can be friendly and an idol and that we can also survive in a race where us hedgehogs are ridiculed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Want to hear about the Headless Horse?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He says that you can go shove your horn up your-&quot;</p>

<p>Tails meet some new friends of mine that I just met, this here fox is Max who appears to have twin tails just like you and almost has your voice but deeper&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And as you asked SO NICELY, I might as well tell you!</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Spike, Twilight!</p>

<p>&quot;Hiya, my name is Pinkie Pie&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now why on EARTH do you need ME?&quot;</p>

<p>After this…serious character development, Tails, Twilight and a thoroughly frightened Cream pushed their way through a swarm of ponies and reached Fluttershys cottage. NO CHOCCIE! Look him up on YouTube</p>

<p>There was something about this Sonic guy that Dash just found interesting. Knuckles was doing some breakdancing moves in a middle of a rap song, when Applejack came by. So thank you. That was logic that Sonic couldn&#39;t argue with if he tried.</p>

<p>Tails and Knuckles fought over the driving wheel and result in them crashing into the wall, destroying their kart. Mickey asked. Spike asked. WE LOVE YOU! You&#39;re not getting this emerald. Tried to put that up with my mind!</p>

<p>Amy and Pinkie finally got out of the mud and came in 6th.</p>

<p>Rarity was trying her hardest to look fashionable but anything was 20% harder with Pinkie Pie around. He froze. Roxas and Sora roared in fear. she thought to herself. Mickey lowered his head. That sounded seriously wrong, I know.</p>

<p>The racers had time before the actual race happens, so they are just chilling and enjoy the fair. Twilight went through that mirror once to get her tiara back from Sunset Shimmer, who came from beyond the mirror to take it for herself. She hides behind the corner, out of Amy&#39;s sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Applejack and Knuckles arm wrestles each other.</p>

<p>The leaders are apparently called &#39;alicorns&#39; and have the greatest power imaginable!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel you Knuckles!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A challenge, eh partner?</p>

<p>&quot;I think its Bowser,&quot; Mario said.</p>

<p>Continuing on! Dash said with surprise. Oh well, everpony knew Pinkie held parties at the most random of times. Later, Sonic and Dash were talking at Fluttershy&#39;s which still had the big hole in it after Sonic&#39;s run-in with it. Rouge put her ear to the door, but heard nothing. Hey, want to check the Pokémon club before we hit the Psychic Club?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the library, Tails was examining the Chaos Emerald. Trixie pulled on her grapping hook to get them to safer grounds. As soon as Pinkie moved on to Sonic with her REALLY big knife, Rainbow stated to panic and beg Pinkie not to do it. You&#39;re just paranoid.</p>

<p>&quot;I got one!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it turns out that people mistake me for some hormone-driven hedgehog fiend…&quot; Amy stated.</p>

<p>&quot;Name one, boss.&quot;</p>

<p>Unknown and Amanda caught up to them. Trixie pulled on her grapping hook to get them to safer grounds. A spine freezing sensation that could only be described if you stood at the South Pole without anything covering you, not even fur. Dash remembered Twilight said that when she first meet her. Inside of it was a man. That was where Rainbow had to say something.</p>

<p>Everything had been set…A completely oblivious Sonic, an even more oblivious Tails, a spiked cup of tea and a conveniently placed video camera in place.</p>

<p>Sonic and Rainbow weakly looked at each other. Mickey lowered his head. Saying this caused a flash of blinding white light. Rainbow Dash flew on over to Rouge. The portal started to close! Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Everyone, even the other racers, laughed at Celestia&#39;s joke. Then Sonic felt it. He did the super peel-out to get out of the way, but Sonic his guard down and got hit by her horn blast. She was a hero after all. The two boys darted to the blue hedgehog. Applejack knew she had heard the sound around the same time as Knuckles and the others had appeared, and said it to Knuckles.</p>

<p>Sonic&#39;s mind swelled with rage. Mickey asked. Once the great and mighty Trixie beat him, Trixie will get the respect she deserves!</p>

<p>Back on Mobius, Cream and the Babylon Rogues who had only agreed because of the promise Wave and Cream made, were using their Extreme Gear to get back to Tails&#39; laboratory. Calvin grabbed Hobbes and started to run. Inside of it was a man. It was still daylight, so Sonic and rainbow went outside for a sparring match.</p>

<p>Becomes a horny little bastard.</p>
