NaNoGenMo
=========

National Novel Generation Month.

A script to automatically generate a 50,000-word "novel" during November, as an alternative to writing it. Based on an idea by Github user [dariusk](https://github.com/dariusk) co-ordinated [here](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo).

My script automatically scrapes user-submitted stories from FanFiction.net, mashes them together and remixes them into something almost entirely devoid of meaning.
