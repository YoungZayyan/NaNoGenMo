Dear Melody,

20 looked around at the seventeen hours and five square miles that had always been her home and felt a sliver of fear. Amy grinned, coming out from behind her desk to run toward him and hug him tightly.

'Okay, so, green ghost thing inside a TARDIS, caves that aren't caves and people going missing?' She had her Koschei and it wasn't him.

Hopefully, he wouldn't be hearing a knock at the curtain. We're coming for you, I swear. the first mate echoed, mockingly as Olivia pulled Toby back to wrap an arm around his shoulders. Olivia asked as Alex watched the candles.

'Yes, right. That sort of thing isn't easily forgotten. He started laughing.

'Maybe what?'

'Here! Go! She was experimenting all the time, pushing things, taking mad risks. He wasn't sure where the comforting words had come from, but he was unutterably grateful for his brain having kicked out something useful this time.

Olivia cautiously stepped toward the tub at the base of the vat of Flesh, pulling the Doctor with her by the hand. Rory asked Olivia. Professor River song. Rory demanded.

Olivia danced around the console to Muse's Supermassive Black Hole as the Doctor stood staring at the scanner, Amy and Rory near the TARDIS door, playing darts. Olivia snapped, standing tall and placing her hands on her hips as he looked up at her.

'I think I might be,' she said. They stood, silent for a moment in the hollow moon. Things to do, people to see. So, do you want that more than you want to kill one man? she wondered, letting him pull her left hand into his left hand as he stepped behind her.

After a little while, the lights started to flicker. More of a big box, really. Rory wondered.

A/N: i think Olivia would toally enjoy having two Doctors around, as demonstrated, and she would treat them both equally, so everything still hangs on Amy as before. Oh well. But that's…it's not possible. He stretched across the table and grabbed her hand. A shuffle.

Rory stepped toward the light and knelt down to pick up the nanorecorder then looked to the Doctor.

Compassion and empathy you do lack;

He moved back and, with a spinning head, stood up. he ordered her, tossing the ropes he was using to drag the panel with aside to march toward Idris. Down to the hairs on its chinny chin chin. I know I would. She poured herself a glass of the punch. Both helpless.

"Oh!

"So you're like a…sea urchin.

I suspect that it was sheer incompetence on my part, but lets go with her more generous interpretation."

"Doctor!

"When they gave me this project, I thought about just telling that pompous windbag 'no' and taking the consequences, maybe joining Susan," he moved to one of the consoles that needed repair and grumbled as he removed a plate from it.

'What do you remember? he told her but she only dragged him after the Doctor and Olivia. Olivia snapped.

'The fault?' The sudden cessation of the wind was startling.

Sophie-24 climbed up onto the huge hairy back of the Efapan, then reached back to Tella-19, pulling her up as well. However, I thought it was important to see Roady's POV after their fight and how he deals with it. She could feel herself heating up, but ignored it. he shouted into the teeth of the wind, the bitterness in his hearts far more painful than his physical wounds.

Olivia aimed her Sonic at the Cyberman and made a shooting sound, imitating the recoil of a gun as the Cyberlegion outside…exploded, ship by ship.

'I was those two people's worst fear, back on Earth II. A little fob watch.' I asked Teresa from inventory if I could have some, 'n I got the jacket custom made. They belong to the BBC, no matter how much I beg and plead Steven Moffat! He tossed the cube across the room. Canton asked the group.

Adie moved more briskly after them, wondering what was behind those walls the Doctor had erected and why the people who loved him most in the universe were also so terribly scared of him. It was muffled through all the dirt, the thick metal hull, and the closed door, but it sounded like the buried hospital ship was caught in a waterfall of ball bearings. What do they want?'

Suddenly, the big bug fell apart into its smaller selves and Rose fell through a rain of metal insects, landing hard, and rolling to her feet quickly. With a muttered curse, he plunged off the floe and into the river. You will be more than us. he questioned, moving out of the way. But apparently you all love me anyway. Olivia ground out.

Adie flinched a little at this. They put me in here. he exclaimed giddily. You will not be a mad lady with a house full of cats. Tomoko blinked in confusion and then shook her head, sticking to the topic.

'Only humans,' is said, slowly, thinking about it. It was a mysterious piece of TimeLord tech that seemed to be an explosive, planted in his TARDIS. Where ever it's gone, it's likely that the people who've gone missing are there, too.'

Perched in front of him, on a bar on the antenna where he clung, was a tiny silvery creature, the size of a fruit wasp. he asked her.

'And they bring lots of people, too,' Lussie chimed, happy. Real house. Nikki protested.

Olivia cautiously stepped toward the tub at the base of the vat of Flesh, pulling the Doctor with her by the hand. He was barefoot, with only a jumper and jeans on, and the cold was seeping into his clothes. He stepped ahead to lead the way through the junkyard and they stopped on a hill to look over the landscape.

A beetle trundled over the hill towards her, moving slowly but inexorably towards the two TARDIS. But, seven minutes later she found that the Doctor was already there, reading a book and settled into one of the awful chairs..

"Done."
